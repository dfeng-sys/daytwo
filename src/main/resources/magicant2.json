I'm not sure how I'm going to come up with three minutes of original material covering a dislike for touch based control\\.\n\nI may try to make myself play through earthbound again\\. maybe super mario world and super metroid while I'm at it? no I don't think I'll have that much time\\.\n\nspent only a brief moment on the walk back to my room pondering what exactly the facets of me that I'm so dissatisfied with are\\. there are just so many things that make up a person that are underdeveloped in me\\. so many things a person will have to deal with in life that deep down I know I'm so unready to face\\.\n\nall this time and time again, and every day is the same\\. was today the same? I wasted so much time today on gizmodo and the like, and further organizing my itunes library, which I'd promised to stop doing\\. it's just one of those many places where there will never be any contentment to be found in perfect organization, and it shouldn't be so hard at this point to stop caring and putting so much stake in it\\. I'm sure nobody else I know thinks of these things this way\\.\\.they have it nice, don't they\\.\n\nall my perfect movie in my head scenarios pathetically consist of nice cars and high\\-end electronics\\.\n\nI don't know how well this 750 words thing is working for me\\. that don't\\-break\\-the\\-streak thing is keeping me going every day so far, but I'm honestly wondering if I'm being subconsciously lazy and convincing myself without realizing it that the 750 word minimum isn't all that great because it's just making me churn out stuff, and that if I really wanted to write I'd just be writing whatever, not always 750 words of things\\.\n\ntomorrow I have to shopping for \"groceries\" while squeezing in studying for all the material we've covered all semester in UI design\\. I'm also starting to think I should have signed up for a monday presentation in english, so I can get it over with sooner\\.\\.unsure if I would be thinking similarly if I actually had\\. but finishing the presenting, leaving behind the nervousness, and not caring about how good or bad people might it is is very appealing right now\\.\n\nat least it's not some essay or writing I have to be working on right now\\. finishing the psyc lab report early was worth something after all\\.\n\nI wish I knew how to cook\\. it's just so much better in about every possible way than going out to buy hot pockets and eating a little carton of yogurt every morning\\. add to the list of ways I need to revise my lifestyle that I'd really like to start checking off soon\\.\n\nwhat I need is a notebook to write in, a clean desk\\.\\.some place where there is zero electronic interference\\. I'm spending more time thinking about creating the optimal environment and envisioning what I'm going to be like living in it than doing anything else\\. how do I do this?\n\nlast",

I still can’t understand why she *still* listens to her sister, after all the times she’s bitched about her\\. and proceeded to bitch about her to me for the rest of the week, as \\[bitch sister\\] kept emailing her after she blocked her on messages\\.\n\nso she reported to me that she “panic sold” all 320 shares that she’d accumulated for a loss \\(albeit a much smaller one than previously unrealized\\) only to watch the price run fairly deep into what would have been profitable territory almost immediately after\\. then proceeded to buy back in, now at a loss again assuming her position hasn’t changed\\.\n\nI’m finally realizing just how compulsively she gambles on trades, and also that she’s likely not as deep in the red as she makes herself sound\\. she’s now casually dropped her position in the 35% tax bracket multiple times, leading me to speculate that she’s subtly bragging\\. and I hate that she does that to me, that she has me wondering about her, her true circumstances, her true intentions\\. I don’t find myself thinking this way about anyone else\\.\n\nI still agreed to meet with her for seafood tonight, and I suspect that she’ll just bitch to me some more about her sister, and we’ll repeat the same tired old platitudes about the stock market\\. I kind of feel like showing off a little more about asta to her, but I honestly don’t really care about Dorothy’s opinion\\.\n\nI met the Ruiying at the office on wednesday and I’m pretty sure I’m the only one who didn’t say hi to her\\. she seems to be the type to look for others to lead the interactions\\. at lunch, she brought a thick backpack with her, and took out a full\\-size spray bottle to sanitize her chair and eating surface, immediately prompting Anthony to shit all over her\\. she kind of reminds me of Dorothy’s Natalie\\.",
