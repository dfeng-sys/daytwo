I&apos;ll be spending all of it in my room this time unless I get a text from ritchie about going to church. I&apos;ll be going if he does and asks me. otherwise it looks like I&apos;ll be firmly planted in this chair for the rest of the day cranking out the psyc lab report that I failed to deliver to myself all of yesterday. why oh why do I do this to myself always? not so great when you consider how it only gets harder from here after school ends..&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I haven&apos;t prayed in a very long time. I don&apos;t think I&apos;m trying to avoid it. I have no reason to, but I&apos;m always afraid to go back to it after a several-week-long hiatus. I feel like I don&apos;t deserve asking God for anything after facing away from him for this long. but He knows what I&apos;m thinking and besides I&apos;ve turned away many times before and there&apos;s simply no point in hiding. why would I want to hide? that just distances me more. I can&apos;t hide, anyway. maybe I just have this tendency to leave things unattended because I&apos;m afraid of the work I&apos;ll have to put in to bring it back to life and subsequently maintain it and keep it shiny. only the things for which the upkeep is taxing. I&apos;m looking at the runway instead of the finish line and I need my eyes on both, one or the other at certain times and I don&apos;t know which to concentrate on and when.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><hr/><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">04-02; monday</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">fuck fuck I completely forgot to finish writing. because for me the day is not over yet. it&apos;s 20 past midnight and I just remembered that I didn&apos;t remember to finish writing before 12 fuck.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I&apos;ve spend all freaking day writing this psyc lab without too much procrastinating and maybe I just work extraordinarily slowly because it&apos;s been 9 hours now and I&apos;m still not done. I&apos;ve run out of non-bullshit material to write so bullshit is all that&apos;s left. half semi bullshit. writing for a psyc report still must make some sense.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I doubt sam&apos;s still at the meeting he said he was at when I texted him asking if knew some psyc lab details I didn&apos;t.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I shot the email containing my two crappy html pages to my group members and was all lolz inside.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I miss the days when it would have been practical to only have 1) a motorola razr (the old flip phone) that would be used for a) calling and b) texting and c) nothing else, and 2) a 2nd gen ipod nano that would be used for a) listening to music and b) nothing else. sweet and simple and your only concerns should you lose one or both of them would be convincing your parents to buy you a replacement and convincing your friends that it&apos;s not actually you who&apos;s spamming them with horrid texts.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I can&apos;t decide whether I hate smartphones or not. the impact such technologies are having on our lives is not a new topic for me by any means but it was the subject that a guest professor spoke about today during english, and I&apos;m sure the topic is what stayed my attention rather than his speaking. I actually finished the assigned reading last night for the class too, which I&apos;ve never really done since the first week of school back when I assumed it was important. it was a short piece and it concerned mobile phones. hey.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">according to the professor mobile phones have become a necessity in everyday life and as a tech-y guy who&apos;s been able to follow this new age of smartphones since apple lit the fuse with the iphone, I have to agree. it was amazing at first, really. nowadays people and tech blogs are constantly spying on apple and other giant tech companies for any signs of new products, but apple&apos;s first iphone was truly its best surprise. it was something nobody had a clue was coming and was seriously unlike anything that had ever been made before which would be why many were skeptical, if still excited, that it would work. a 3.5 inch touchscreen was giant and unheard of and the inertia scrolling was so cool that the people present at apple&apos;s keynote started cracking up when steve jobs first showed it off.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">fast forward to today, where 3.5 inches is now considered small (what is this?! a smartphone for ants?) and touchscreens are even bigger (ipad, damn it) and all these superphones aren&apos;t just commonplace, they&apos;re unavoidable now. it&apos;s making me nervous. once upon a time friends would exclaim iphone! you got a what?! whereas now they&apos;ll pull their own phones out of their pockets and detail how they&apos;re better than yours. the newness is gone. the unreal feeling of using one of these devices for the first time, that were so futuristic yet actually existed! is gone and can never come back. it&apos;s why getting an ipad 2 did nothing for me last year, why I was unable to reproduce my unashamedly nerdy amazement using a 10-inch touchscreen brought. once the future is here it&apos;s got nowhere to go but to the past, eh.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">productivity</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">strange rant I just went on wunnit.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I had a fun psyc lab today. our group is officially going through with our leave money behind and see what people do idea. our procedure that we carried out today was this: find somebody sitting at a table or chair alone. one of us would sit across from them. that way there&apos;s no way for them to not notice. we&apos;d set a phone with a dollar bill under it, then after just a couple minutes, get up, grab the phone without looking and leave the dollar behind and see if people say anything. if they don&apos;t then a different group member comes along and sits in the same place, then after a minute grabs the dollar for himself. see if they say anything then. we tested ten people today, and one person returned the dollar when he noticed us leave it behind. nobody else said anything. well actually a girl asked me if the dollar was mine when I had the role of the thief. I had to lie and say it was mine since I felt that that course of action was most in line with the rest of this experiment, but that left the girl with no choice really, lest she decide to confront me further and it would take a lot of courage to do that. poor her. I&apos;m quite sure she knew the dollar didn&apos;t belong to me too..</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><hr/><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">04-03; tuesday</span></div></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">today kind of feels like a waste. it&apos;s 7pm and making the trip to the mall and back took three hours and felt a little like a time warp. yes, I did go there today, making the decision kind of unconsciously. I had never really settled my mind on it, just got on the trolley then off the trolley and onto the subway and managed to find my way to the mall after exiting the station at a different part than I had last time. I bought a $60 pair of sol republic headphones since I was just going to get a $60 apple gift card to buy a pair of headphones with anyway. I felt less lame that way. but still fairly lame. more than fairly.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">today was uneventful and I can&apos;t recall any thoughts that might have passed through my head. I think my excursion to the mall wiped it all out.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">tonight&apos;s small group is starting. I&apos;ll be back.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">after spending about 40 fucking minutes on the fucking daze project, I&apos;m left with less than half an hour to finish writing.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">which sucks because I won&apos;t have to time to organize the tangle in my head that got really knotted up during and after small group. first and foremost, david is driving her and three of her emory friends who randomly came over out of nowhere to emory. I don&apos;t understand what&apos;s up with that. I can&apos;t help but acknowledge that a part of me is still viewing him as a threat. it mitigates a bit every time he puts his arm around me because that indicates to me that I&apos;m likable enough and am most likely not giving off any negative vibes. I just don&apos;t understand how he became so heavily involved with our group so quickly. he&apos;s even spreading to emory now. emory, where I&apos;ve been only once and the only things I know about her friends there are their names.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I&apos;m not even thinking about how I should be happier for him and not be judging this scenario so harshly.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I&apos;d like to write down a nice long prayer containing everything in my heart. I thought many of the applications brought forth by the members of our very large small group tonight were very vague and instantly decided they would probably whither away unenforced. after george closes our meeting in a short prayer that didn&apos;t directly address any of the prayer requests made, everybody got up and, it seemed to me as it does every time, instantly forgot about everything we just talked about. it always surprises me how quickly everybody seems to just drop it. at the same time I&apos;m well aware I&apos;m in no position to judge because I hop into the same current. I think about turning over the meeting&apos;s thoughts in my head later that night, a time which would equate to now this very moment as I&apos;m typing but of course I&apos;m typing to finish my words before midnight and God isn&apos;t weighing very heavily on my mind at the moment, what is instead is how hungry I am right now and what the hell david is doing at emory with the people I desperately want to befriend but can&apos;t/don&apos;t spend time with.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I recently realized that all the fantastic relationships I&apos;ve been envisioning myself having with her are nowhere close to existing. it&apos;s been almost two years since we&apos;ve gotten to know each other and we&apos;re still only the most casual of friends. and there&apos;s certainly no problem with that at all, nothing wrong of course. I just happened to realize that stepping significantly further into her circle and her and her brother&apos;s circle, their network from their church and from emory is something that I just cannot do given my circumstances. I don&apos;t know why it&apos;s taken me this long to recognize so many of these truths, that are all so cold and solid and all but seemingly impossible to not notice. I&apos;m wondering why I ever thought I&apos;d be able to become good friends with her other friends, people who are completely alien to me but who she smiles at and laughs with and pats on the shoulder. she&apos;s well adapted in her environment and I haven&apos;t the slightest clue how to tread through. I turn around and lower my head and get the fuck out of there as quickly as I can. then I breathe a sigh of relief and wish I could hold my breath for a little bit longer.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><hr/><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">04-04; wednesday</span></div></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I just read through all 9 pages of posts on spill-your-secrets.tumblr.com. a lot of them are about depression, self-harm, and suicide. I found them all impossible for me to fathom. it began feeling like reading the same things over and over. I can&apos;t imagine how low one has to feel to believe the best course of action is to die. I can kind of feel the sad-movies-actually-make-you-happy effect on me now too because reading about people who genuinely feel this broken undeniably makes me glad that I have all that I have. that my biggest problems are suddenly so negligible. if I could hold onto enough love in my heart to pray for people who&apos;ve never experienced any. not even from their friends and family who are supposed to be their backbone, their failsafe, their one unbreakable resource. it makes me want to hug someone and cry. I want to be someone somebody can lean on and cry. hopefully I&apos;ll succeed one day. that&apos;s what it gets me dwelling on..</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">two people in my cs3750 group, neither of whom was me, were engaged in a brief heated but controlled argument about uneven group contribution. our &quot;designer&quot; member had given us her designs two weeks later than she was supposed to, and on top of that she frequently shows up late to our meetings and claims she&apos;s always busy with other meetings and more recently, that she was moving and moving all her stuff. so that was funny too. the other two of us said nothing. the guy actually waved good-bye to me and I responded because I&apos;m not a douche. we&apos;re buddies [ownagepranks]. we&apos;re buddies now. fuck that lol.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">no, I have a lot to say about tonight. good things, bad things, big things, petty things, personal emotional whiny things.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">first things first though. I register for the summer&apos;s and next fall&apos;s classes fairly easily. I just hope I&apos;m picking the right classes. I still don&apos;t know what&apos;s going to happen in the event I actually find myself a job offer though.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">after our graphics class sam and I walk back towards his apartment but we bump into angela studying outside and end up going to one of sam&apos;s friend&apos;s room. he makes us chicken pot pies. sam and mike play an annoying game on their phones before we leave and mike and I go to the CRC to work out. I can still barely do any pull-ups. I was feeling tired and a bit giddy by the end of it and mike was wondering if he should be concerned.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">tonight&apos;s ACF:</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">enoch is our speaker for the evening. before his message though we play through a round of jeopardy whose questions he had come up with on his own. it was a fun game. constant screaming and objections at the slightest rule bending. for the record, in actual jeopardy, it doesn&apos;t matter if you start answering in a non-question form or give the wrong answer at first, as long as you end up giving the correct one within your time limit.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">his message is about worship. a recap: how can people stand in the house of God, singing and worshiping to some of the world&apos;s most beautiful music, and be checking their watches, texting on phones, yawning, and thinking about where they were going to eat after the last song is over? worship teams sweat. those who sing sweat. they&apos;re moving, screaming, singing their hearts out, jumping everywhere, filled with His presence. you can see it when it&apos;s there, within the band members. if the sight of that doesn&apos;t move you, then you&apos;re not doing something right.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">then we write haikus about God and what He&apos;s done in our lives. mine went like this:</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I have been given a new set of eyes that I cannot see without.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">the girls snipped their fingers at that, as they had been doing after all of the haikus that were read out loud.

I haven&apos;t heard him sing since emerge. the songs were white flag, one thing remains, and revelation song. I&apos;ll be listening to those again soon. but not before I finish listening to &quot;frühling in paris&quot; on repeat, which I really feel like listening to after what I just saw while walking back into my room.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">takorea was out choice of eats for the night. I knew exactly what I would order this time and it would be the same things that I had ordered the last time I was there. I ordered a fried shrimp and a calamari tako and the french fries they have that they dip in sesame oil. she sits next to me, and he next to her.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I talk to her rarely enough so that any even slightly significant amount of interaction with her feels unusual. despite wanting it badly, I find myself hurrying out every time I say more than two sentences to her, while desperately calming myself at the same time. the usual lack of conversation coupled with the very much alive remnants of what I still feel towards her make it frustratingly difficult to not become slightly euphoric every time she talks to me, hugs me, touches me, laughs at what I say or do. my heart doesn&apos;t race every time she does, but I make sure to admit to myself that I like it whenever she touches me. in fact tonight she patted me on the cheek and I actually vocally expressed a happiness, but it was loud in the restaurant so nobody heard. I do know though that she&apos;s simply a little bit of a touch-y person and frequently gives the people she&apos;s talking to pats on the arm or leg. so I&apos;ve forcefully managed to convince myself that I&apos;m nothing so special to her just because she touches me too. and now that I&apos;ve been able to throw the delusion off of me, I can declare her out of my boundary now. I walked quickly, following somebody and I thought &quot;perfect!&quot; when the person turned to sixth street because I had left my buzzcard in my room. before the person gets to the door though someone from inside opens it and I thought it was somebody waiting for the person but no, surprise! he and she walk through the door and they&apos;re. holding. hands. don&apos;t think about it don&apos;t think it. thinking about me. it&apos;s very easy believing that they weren&apos;t expecting anybody they knew to catch them holding hands. but I saw them holding hands. they were holding each other&apos;s hands. she&apos;s gone now, isn&apos;t she. she&apos;s officially greyed out. not an option anymore. I&apos;ve flipped the switch, pulled the lever and can&apos;t go back to it now. there&apos;s no reason now to believe she likes me any more than she likes me. the sight of them holding hands will overpower my subconscious. the watertight doors are shut and the turmoil boiling inside my heart is safely contained. within me.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><hr/><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">04-05; thursday</span></div></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I wake up at 10: 30. that&apos;s a normal early time for me to wake up now after sleeping in. I know sam is at the microsoft store again this time with allison and diana. I had just happened to find the facebook post giving the fact away. I had also expressed a small amount of desire of returning to the store too. but sam didn&apos;t invite me this time.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I listen to rammstein on the walk to class. sam and taylor are already at the starbucks, as evidenced when they walk up to me as I walk into the building. I decide, as I&apos;m walking up the stairs with them on our way to finish collecting data, that I&apos;ll write whatever the fuck I want to, and not let myself, of all people, restrict what goes on here. even though I know there are more important things, even though I&apos;m making a bigger deal out of this than it actually is, even though I know I shouldn&apos;t be preoccupied with it, even though writing about makes me feel guilty. but I don&apos;t care.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">last night as I was falling asleep I kept thinking about them holding hands again. I had brushed her fingers by accident last night. I started imaging holding her hand. small and warm, each of her five fingers working together to grip mine. or not mine, rather. it&apos;s not my hand she&apos;ll be holding. brushing her fingers was just a tiny taste of what it&apos;d be like holding on to something, somebody alive who wants to hold my hand as much I want to hold hers. I wonder what it&apos;s like to know somebody is in love with you too</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I had little trouble falling asleep. I did have a dream in which she hugged several people and ignored me. I woke up realizing that she wouldn&apos;t hold my hand. that her not going after me was a dream come true. not a good dream. not a nightmare though. far from it. I wasn&apos;t exactly about to cry. nowhere close, actually. it started to make me wonder how much I really &quot;love&quot; her if I don&apos;t cringe knowing she&apos;s..with not me. is it because I had been trying to shut her out? that I had been leaving the door just ajar so I can still peek through the crack but not let it be blown open? perhaps the impact it would otherwise have had on was mitigated. no matter. I&apos;m closing the door now. and locking it. with a dead bolt. but I&apos;m keeping the key.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">every time I hear a girl&apos;s voice down the hallway I have to freeze and make sure it&apos;s not her. I really don&apos;t want to hear her voice.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I used to wander around the room before ACF starts going up to the people I don&apos;t normally see or interact with and poke them or stare at them or look at their computer screens if they were on computers. I found out a while ago that it&apos;s much more fulfilling and peaceful for me to just sit at a desk and stay quiet. I have nothing to talk about even to the friendly ones, say hyo jae. no, I&apos;d much rather be myself and let someone who loves me walk over to me. I know life doesn&apos;t work that way generally, but I really don&apos;t care. it&apos;s what I always feel like doing whenever I&apos;m in that room. that&apos;s what I&apos;ll do from now on.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">another thing that made me question what I feel towards her is the ease with which I was able to resolve to not resent him. it was easy. I don&apos;t hate him. in fact I just bumped into him today in the maulding activity room right next to the laundry room. he was in charge of some easter egg hunt activity. I happened to be doing laundry at the same time. I simply walked into the room and genuinely smiled. no fake smiles for him. I ate many jellybeans.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">he&apos;ll be going to the concert (forgot band name and location; probably passion city church) together with sam and steph and a couple others. when he mentioned that to me I flashed back to the david crowder band concert during which I had discovered that another two of us had become a couple. would he kiss her head there too..? hold her in her arms</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">sam had never told me about the concert.

I want it to hurt more. my heart&apos;s supposed to bleeding right now..why can&apos;t I feel anything? why am I so dead about this, one of the few things that should emotionally overpower me above all else..</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">this IS the first time, for the record, that I like a girl who not only doesn&apos;t like me, but likes somebody else instead. that&apos;s never happened before, at least not while I was aware. we were too young before now for that to happen, really. that&apos;s why. it makes sense if you think about it.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I&apos;m going to be watching a japanese horror movie with david tonight. no word on who else will be with us. if she is, I&apos;ll be very upset. plus I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ll be able to excuse myself and leave.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><hr/><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">04-06; friday</span></div></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">it occurred to me that I&apos;ve lost the folder containing [spaghetti]&apos;s stuff. doesn&apos;t matter. I&apos;m going to be deleting more of her music later too. it&apos;s only been a few months. months pass quickly when you&apos;re at school, but it still feels like a long time successfully gone by without thinking about her. right, I don&apos;t even think about her anymore. &quot;losing&quot; her for the first time had also felt a lot more painful than anything I&apos;ve felt at school too..so that means I&apos;m perfectly fine. we&apos;re ok.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">my group actually offered me the choice of not speaking during our presentation this morning. as soon as he said it I knew I shouldn&apos;t accept, but that I would. and I did. all I did during our presentation was merely work the computer for a few minutes. I wonder what the professor was thinking about me. I don&apos;t think my group mates don&apos;t like me too much now. he offered our girl member a donut, so they don&apos;t hate her now either. did I just fail today?</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">david never texted me last night so I watched infection, the 2004 j-horror movie I had bought from amazon, by myself. I made a status on facebook warning people to &quot;always take showers BEFORE watching horror movies&quot; that several people liked. I&apos;ve checked facebook a few times since then each time almost forgetting that I had made a status. I cannot start posting status updates too often. I also randomly posted a &quot;y u no&quot; meme image with the top caption &quot;david&quot; and bottom &quot;craft&quot; on david&apos;s wall without realizing that it seemed like I was questioning why he never answered me. he got back to me this morning saying sorry. no worries, eh? none at all. he&apos;ll be at the concert tonight..I&apos;m going ask him if he wants a marvelous night destroyed by a shitty horror movie.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I hang out with sam for a while. he&apos;s leaving for the concert soon so I just go outside with him to shoot hoops.

I remember tam playing something but don&apos;t remember if she did. I avoided even touching the piano because I didn&apos;t want to go near one until I was planning to learn to play.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I learned a little bit tonight. everything mike was teaching me had only gone into short-term memory though, and I don&apos;t know when I&apos;ll ever set foot into the couch building again or when I&apos;ll be able to sit down at a piano and concentrate and learn something for an hour or two or more. I felt sadness and regret, listening to the broken sequences of notes my fingers drunkenly punched out. I spend a while going through the piece, going only once before I just listen to mike play some of his favorites. I&apos;m rendered incapable of doing anything but marveling at the way the sound flowed and came straight to vivid, colorful life. I long to be able to create this life of my own. I wish my fingers could dance. I wish they could flow in waves and breathe a warm life into black and white keys. the keys that, once mike stops, sit still and look at me, smiling. waiting expectantly. but I sadly get up and reassure them that someday I would come back. I&apos;m the one crying as I leave.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">tonight I got a prolonged glimpse at a facet of the bigger picture.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><hr/><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">04-07; saturday</span></div></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">the day passes quickly.

I delayed my writing by almost two hours this afternoon after playing eliss on my iphone for about an hour. I had wanted to go sit outside and write but there were people playing in the volleyball courts and the thought of someone sitting at a table out in the sun with a laptop open intimidated me. I went back inside. then ritchie calls and reminds me that our small group is meeting at the student center well before the fundraiser starts to practice our skit.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I also got a message in my tumblr inbox today. the first thing I thought of was [paradox] but of course it wasn&apos;t, instead it was [reasonstolovebeingalive] who I hadn&apos;t even considered, really. so she finally gets back to me, and I&apos;ll have her to answer too. she says she loves me for talking to her. I&apos;m not giving up either, love. I&apos;m still here too, where I&apos;ve always been, where I don&apos;t see myself leaving.

I long to have some ability too, but never consider the effort. music, at least, I know I&apos;ll be able to learn if I want to.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">right now, under the couch is dimly lit at usual, with music streaming from three different sources. mike is on the piano playing a song I recognize from last night. sam practices his act on his guitar, and some other song is playing over the big speakers. it&apos;s not quite like a movie scene, but softer, more serene music always takes hold of part of my consciousness and leaves what&apos;s left out here in the real room where I&apos;m sitting. one ear hears the music, the other hears the voices of everyone talking and chatting. it&apos;s monotonous and colorful simultaneously. just like static if you look at it from far away, but very much alive when you look closer.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">backstreet boys is playing.

I feel lifeless, like I don&apos;t really harbor any true feelings towards the things that I thought I care about. heart-wrenching movies, sentimental songs, my crush, God. I look at all of it nearly exclusively analytically, mechanically, lifelessly, rather than viewing it emotionally, as something real that in fact exists. is there any way to crack my shell open before my tear ducts dry out and rust?</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I&apos;m listening to the titanic soundtrack right now and feel like I&apos;m soaring through the air with the wind in my face like leonardo on the bow of the ship. in a moment though I&apos;m going to have to land and dock again at port reality. reality is the iceberg and fantasy is the ship. mine is just a rickity old boat like jack sparrow&apos;s at the beginning of the first pirates of the caribbean movie and it&apos;s difficult upgrading your boat to become an ocean liner like the titanic.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">as per usual I have little clue regarding my computer graphics project due in a day. at the same time I have the english project to tackle too.

I don&apos;t think anybody is assigned to that tone now. correction, my reminders alert tone is chime, and I will change that right now: I just changed it back to the default. I still struggle to not jump every time I get a text, but boy did my heart leap every time a message arrived from her. on its own. of its own accord. something I wanted so much actually given to me. eventually though it became stifling. looking back, I&apos;d felt like I was stuck on flypaper. nothing was happening, nothing was progressing. I was just trapping myself in this one location because I was too afraid to go anywhere else. I wouldn&apos;t know how to deal with the heavier weight. I feel foolish again thinking about it. silly. silly me. what was going through my head, eh? harmless, unintentionally harmful, half-hearted, blind encouragement from my friend [teemo] almost knocked me over and I&apos;d almost never come closer to asking a girl out. a stronger force however, wielded by a wiser friend, was just enough to stay me. I almost ignored him, even though everything he had ever told me and done for me was good. let&apos;s just say I&apos;m very glad I listened to him. not that I&apos;d have very much to regret now if I hadn&apos;t.

God is calling me, after all, isn&apos;t He? why else would I even be remotely interested in joining the leadership team. if I&apos;m so scared that I&apos;m unfit for the job, who else but He would I be putting my faith into? perhaps this signifies a growth. it&apos;s unlike last year, when I paid no attention whatsoever to leadership and didn&apos;t even think once about joining. my heart lies here now though.

I&apos;ve forgotten how much I love her, I think. I never thought about it too much, I have to say to stay honest. I like her hair, and I tell her so. her face looks tired, and she&apos;s sick too, but I couldn&apos;t stop looking at her eyes, they were so alive.

I immediately thought about how badly I had always wanted such a thing, and then thought with contempt about how failed it&apos;d always end up being. last summer I kept in touch with not a single person at tech, save for [chime] who really doesn&apos;t count. she never put any effort into it anyway. for the first time though I realized that there&apos;s no one to blame for the darkness but me. again. self-imposed darknesses are a specialty of mine, apparently. maybe this time if I could somehow do more to maintain any contact with any of the people I care about then I wouldn&apos;t feel that empty loneliness which plagues any extended stretch of time spent away from school. it&apos;s shamefully surprising how little I think of the things I don&apos;t do that I can start doing at this moment to improve so many different kinds of happiness.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I admire monique&apos;s, sam&apos;s, diana&apos;s, and her worship. they&apos;re the only ones whose hearts seemed to be with God. everyone else, including me, was hardly even moving. we just stood and sang songs.

I was lucky enough to bump into allison on the way to the CULC for some last minute math studying and she&apos;s kind enough to mention the brief text conversation between me and sam last night where I&apos;d told him we have no psyc class today. the prof had said there would be no lecture, and there wasn&apos;t. but attendance would be mandatory because some groups were collecting data for their final projects. I&apos;d forgotten. that means no lunch with lisa today. I apologized to her profusely (meaning twice with a :( both times). she actually offers to reschedule. I wonder if she even was disappointed at all, of if she really plans on getting lunch anytime next week.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">sam has posted a picture taken at sunrise and tagged cynthia in it. what what they doing up? I learn from him that he had pulled an all-nighter, I forget doing what. and that he had gone with david to the lenox mall yet again. this time to pick up his htc titan which I see him playing with as I walk into the psyc classroom late. he says that they&apos;ll probably go one more time for no reason. just for fun. what the heck?</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">the last minute studying was totally fruitless and the exam today turned out to be one of the biggest bombs in all of college so far. I&apos;m projecting my uncurved grade to be around 50. that&apos;s out of 100. math professor mentions in an email that he could tell from our faces during the test that it was harder than the last one (understatement) and reassures us with a curve. but a grade as low as mine will be can only be curved so high.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I eat alone at the tin drum in tech square. I wish I had a car and could drive around to random restaurants to try eating at by myself. there&apos;d be a lesser pronounced fear of running into somebody I know that way, and it also wouldn&apos;t seem as lame if I actually did bump into someone. some event called sting break is happening at tech square at the same time. it&apos;s a fairly popular event. I see phammy and his friend walk past as I eat. sitting down alone at a small table while being surrounded by groups of people eating together feels very awkward. I&apos;ve spent so much on the more familiar places of tech campus that I don&apos;t experience that feeling anymore at normally crowded areas like the food court and starbucks. tin drum though was nerve rattling. I keep looking around for other people who were also here alone. one person was an older guy and there were a couple other alone guys, with headphones on and with a laptop out. having only people like them to find reassurance in was lame and sinking. I text sam to make myself feel better but to this hour he has yet to reply me.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">no plans for the rest of the day. thursdays have always been my most empty days. sam always has meetings to go to, while I spend my time by myself, wasting it all in my empty room where there is nothing to do. it&apos;s far from a warm cozy room that I would feel good sitting in alone once in a while. mine&apos;s just a dusty coffin that I lie bare in in the dark.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">another thing that just cropped up last night. the slim money clip I had ended up ordering the night I returned to school after spring break is now scheduled to ship just days before I leave for spain, so there is now no way it will land here in time. some guy actually responded personally to a comment I&apos;d left on human republic&apos;s blog, and I have to decide between finding out if it will be possibly to have it delivered to spain or if I can manage to have it delivered to jimmy&apos;s house.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">this is one of the lamest entries I have written. it&apos;s full of holes. little petite petty problems.

I feel like I waste more money by eating at tin drum. I consider getting no ipod of any kind after my iphone&apos;s contract expires. I&apos;ll leave the nano at home and dump the extra piece-of-shit earphones in a dark hole somewhere at home too. along with the extra cables. it&apos;ll be light from now on. and I won&apos;t worry.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><hr/><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">04-13; friday</span></div></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">today&apos;s been eventful but fairly good so far. it&apos;s filled with one main good thing that happened today.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I wake up an hour later than I intended. less than ten minutes before english starts so I skip that class for the first time.

I&apos;ve almost never had a genuine smile spread across my face and as I just noticed today, I try to suppress it when one comes. it was just me and mike in the student center and then we saw david and then sally and steph and then josé and hannah joined and left. I cracked one smile the entire time and several times people remarked that I looked tired. tired of something, that&apos;s for sure, but most certainly not sleepy tired. what asta had told me earlier today seems to be acting as some kind of armor between my skin and steph&apos;s voice. I barely even glance at her as I get up and leave the student center.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I just need to make sure that wherever my silence is stemming from isn&apos;t the result of some kind of bitter resentment that I had been certain I&apos;d defeated no less than a couple of months ago. nor is it any kind of call for attention.

I wonder if something like this could be the reason I&apos;m feeling so uninclined to smile or engage in any small talk with him. or could it be the other way around? I certainly don&apos;t dislike him again. maybe it&apos;s subliminal, subconscious. I really can&apos;t figure it out. I know it&apos;s not good for me and my relationships with the people around me.

I feel I&apos;m not going to miss anything I&apos;m going to regret missing anyway. I hate it incredibly when I&apos;m immersed in a new crowd of people with action going on all around and I still feel left in the dark. walking with a joyful group towards a place that won&apos;t remember me. I&apos;m perfectly content with skipping out on that phase of the night and diving into calmer emptier quieter darker stiller water. the more I think about it, the more I realize I&apos;d in fact rather not be there just when it starts. parties most certainly do not start when I walk in, and as they gain momentum without me I always have to run to keep up and then trip on my own feet. I&apos;d rather get there after all the engines have started. alone in a crowded room. every fucking time.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">did that adequately capture the emotion I am trying to depict here?</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><hr/><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">04-14; saturday</span></div></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I&apos;ll recap the night at emory later, but some things right now:</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">mike, sam, and steph are at david&apos;s. without me. even though I&apos;m in the same building. I did go my own way towards my room, but no one, least of all steph, felt inclined to stop me. she went to his room on her own. them. together. by themselves. mike and sam had some quick business with a parking pass. I hear them shortly afterward laughing just outside my room. and hear them continue talking and laughing from the lobby as I&apos;m getting a cup of water. oh how lucky of me to just happen to hear them and all just as I&apos;m out there..</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I always feel out of place even when I&apos;m where I want to be most.

I don&apos;t even remember the answer I had provided. we spent several minutes on the topic of baptism, enoch being the only one talking while I strained my eyes looking at him as he spoke. he offered to ask grace midtown for information on their baptism procedures and policies for me. I currently have no plans or a particular motive to get baptized.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">the rest of the questions mostly concerned how to make ACF run better and more smoothly. he informed me that since there would be a substantially higher number of leaders next year, we would be split, in a way, between large group and small group planning. having the same leaders attend the leadership meeting and help plan large and small groups cost them a lot of time. I found myself void of all ideas whenever he asked me about any ways I could think of to improve the fellowship. void to the point where I actually said no, there&apos;s nothing I can conceive that can be done. if this was a job interview I probably would have been dismissed immediately.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I&apos;m still having trouble picturing myself more deeply involved with the other leaders. I still feel incapable with nothing new to offer. nothing to offer at all, really, besides some very rare quirky charisma. that was one &quot;talent&quot; of mine enoch had pointed out to me when asking the what-do-I-have-to-bring-to-the-table-question. video production. coming up with something humorous. I like the idea of all the ACF guys eagerly anticipating another video from me for the end of the year. I suppose that&apos;s one thing I can deliver. but anything else? I&apos;m still waiting on God for those.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">enoch doesn&apos;t hesitate to buy a coffee cake for me when I voice my craving for one. I hope I didn&apos;t come off as using him, since he had offered before to buy me something from starbucks if I wanted; I&apos;d forgotten he said so until he got up and offered. I don&apos;t bother resisting when people offer to pay for me anymore. it feels too strange.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">after enoch leaves I walk over to tin drum again and order five of the crab and cheese spring rolls.

I&apos;m somewhat surprised but happy that he trusts me with his car. it&apos;s a little past 7 when we finally leave for emory. the sun is about to set and the air is cool and quiet. I try conveying the strange sensation that comes when knowing there is loud, noise-filled, fully alive action happening elsewhere while the world is so quiet here. over at emory, there is a group of people standing together in a room singing worship. waves of sound inundating the room and reverberating against the walls. also bright piercing light from the projector screen displaying lyrics. yet here are mike and I stuck in traffic in a quiet car. our biggest concern is switching lanes. mike cuts me off as I&apos;m talking before I can even gather the right words to describe the emotion, claiming he shares it too. whether he knew what I meant or not, I don&apos;t know.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">we have ourselves a little mini-adventure when we reach emory campus. since I&apos;ve only set foot here once before the setting feels nearly equally as foreign as the first visit. we walk together into a building that&apos;s the candler library. it&apos;s the same building we all gathered in 5 months ago during the last joint fellowship. we reach the same room but it&apos;s empty and lights are off. mike checks the details and confirms the room is 322. up the stairs to the third floor, and all we find is an eerily empty library that&apos;s a perfect spitting image of what you&apos;d find in ghost movies or harry potter. there is no 322. the absence of any people makes it one of the most surreal moments I&apos;ve experienced recently. our friends aren&apos;t here, nobody is here. mike and I go back outside where I witness a helicopter on a landing pad on the roof of some building start its engine and idle. we&apos;re conveniently walking behind a building as it actually takes off so I miss that part. mike calls up a few people and we meet with someone whom we follow and finally get to the right place.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">the activities for the night were a praise and a scavenger hunt, both of which we missed. excellent. sincerely, not sarcastically, because I honestly think I would have found both of those to be rather dull and unexciting. we get laughed at as we walk into the room. I&apos;m actually happy that we missed everything so I&apos;m amused by it too. several people come to me and ask if I had indeed driven mike&apos;s car. I don&apos;t see why it&apos;s such a big deal.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I&apos;m able to identify only 5 or so people from last time. I&apos;m sure none of them remember me. one guy pats me on the back as he walks by. we&apos;re going out to dinner now. mike drives this time. decision lands on steak n shake, incidentally the same place as we went to last time. mild sympathy expressed towards mike, who had voiced slight aversion to the place. nobody knew that I hadn&apos;t wanted to go there either because of how unhealthy it was. nevertheless I down a &quot;3d grilled cheese,&quot; which contained two patties and 3 types of cheese and a shitload of grease. the emory christine asks me if I&apos;m from NJ because a few people further down our table are talking about NJ again for some reason.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">after steak n shake we go to suno, a bubble tea place that steph had mentioned after our small group once. the thing I order is a massive bowl of shaved ice and condensed milk and strawberries and kiwis. I overhear that george&apos;s truck had gotten broken into while we were at steak n shake. that sucks. I eat my thing while we go back to emory and start shivering a little because it&apos;s making me cold. we go somewhere called clairmont which I learn is separate from main emory campus and appears to be primary for housing. we take the elevator up to top floor of the same round building we spent the night in last time. then we play the same game we played last time too, telephone charades. this time I participate in a round but elect to be the last person in the group to go so that I wouldn&apos;t be acting anything out. I was hoping to make people laugh by guessing something a little outrageous, but had so little to go off of that I couldn&apos;t think up anything funny. so that was disappointing. I notice sam recording with his phone. I text asta for a while and enjoy seeing the camera flash blink every time she answers. we leave at around 1am.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">mike takes the highway back to school, but drives frustratingly slowly.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I&apos;m now brought to the beginning of this entry right here. so go read the top.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I send mike whiny texts that highlight my discontented alone-ness all too obviously. at the same time asta assures me that she does the same in similar situations as mine. so I get invited by mike and david to his room. then I&apos;m basically forced to go to kroger with them because staying with steph and david is not an option even I long to know what went on in there while they were alone. asta suggests that since I had told her I have a crush on her that the reason they may be hiding it from me, if they&apos;re hiding anything at all, is precisely because of that. that somewhat flips the tables and blesses them with a kindheartedness, though it&apos;s mostly out of pity in this case.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">we return from kroger with chili ingredients and mike and sam make the chili. why the fuck does it always have to be chili?

I kind of agree. figuring my emotions out continues to prove exceedingly frustrating. I simply can&apos;t find what my heart is feeling. there&apos;s definitely a jealousy behind knowing what&apos;s going on between him and her, but there haven&apos;t been any twinges, any pangs, any urge to cry, any heart racing, any pain. I keep wondering what david is that I&apos;m not. how he&apos;s able to win her in just the two months since they met (I doubt they&apos;ve known each other for much longer, for any longer, than since we all first met him. although that would be interesting).</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">extra thoughts: while texting mike earlier that night I had been trying to mimic GLaDOS&apos; tone in my words.

I didn&apos;t even think and blabbered that &quot;that&apos;s fine.&quot; I wasn&apos;t about to eat it cold so I felt stupid as I sat down at a table and then got up and walked all the way back to my room to microwave it. then I walked back to the CULC again, 10 minutes late but unsurprisingly no one else from our group had showed up. surprisingly kian is the first to arrive. he&apos;s friendlier than I keep expecting him to be, pats me on the back and sits down by me. I regret that I give off that awkward guy vibe by talking little and talking softly. I work on writing my part about minimalism in touch screens and after about an hour kylie gets here and I&apos;m kind of amused at how much of a flake declan is turning out to be. I thought kian would be the lazy one because he skips so many classes but as it turns out he does his fair share of the work. declan claims he will arrive in fifteen minutes and gets here half an hour later.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">we all finish our writing portions though, and kylie says she will format it. we&apos;ll be meeting to create the book sometime this week I guess. she reports that harkey was excited over the idea of modeling the book after the ipad. overly excited if you ask me.

I always and still look at it all objectively. it&apos;s been a long time and I still get frustrated towards my inability to swallow it all with my heart and finally have it settle into my depths so I can understand. I&apos;m beginning to wonder, but not necessarily fear, that I&apos;ve just reached an apex and am starting now to fall back downhill. I think I&apos;m giving up again. I&apos;ve given up countless times in the past and restarted my efforts over and over but this time feels particularly pronounced. perhaps this time I&apos;m dropping from higher than I&apos;ve ever climbed before. the summit still remains invisible and I&apos;m finding it easier to simply fall back onto the ground. it&apos;s still solid after all. it&apos;s not water, I can stand on this. but this isn&apos;t a problem whose best solution is the easiest. seek and I&apos;ll find, He tells me, and I&apos;m starting to get very tired of seeking..where do I turn now? religion isn&apos;t, and has never been, a significant part of me, even if it&apos;s become a much bigger slice of my life. I can&apos;t imagine what color such a truly God-centered life is. He&apos;s still invisible. I can&apos;t see Him. the biggest glimpse I&apos;ve gotten so far is the material in the ACF application, and I distinctly felt incredulity at being asked to perform the tasks brought forth. I instantly thought that those were simply not things I&apos;m meant to do. I believe it&apos;s still God I&apos;m trusting by handing one in anyway, because apparently there&apos;s no one else. what is it that&apos;s barring me from embracing this new kind of lifestyle that revolves around something that I&apos;m not sure exists.. am I afraid? or stubborn?</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I&apos;ve scrolled past several posts on the-unpopular-opinions submitted by people who hate people. I read one just now by someone who has no hope for humanity because of &quot;what we&apos;ve become.&quot; what have we become? it&apos;s impossible for me to say here while at tech 24-fucking-7. I do my best to refrain from judging people because of how narrow a setting we&apos;re all trapped in together. I&apos;m placing a lot of my hope into my time after graduation, after I&apos;m able to get the fuck out of here. perhaps each day would feel more full then. or maybe they&apos;ll become drained ever more. it&apos;s ridiculously easy to glance at anybody while sitting in a study building like the CULC and instantly assume their lives are empty and ha, they don&apos;t know what they&apos;re doing because they&apos;re all techie computer guys who fawn over their smartphones constantly. but any detectable amount of assurance coming from making a point to not take out my phone while waiting in line for food is a surefire signal that I&apos;m far, far, far from complete and that I&apos;m not any more than one of the people I&apos;m deriding. in fact I&apos;m more like one of them than not. I&apos;m one of those who weigh the average down. I&apos;ll never be complete, but I desperately want to dig myself out of here.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I just read an article that I found linked from gizmodo. according to it, the more we think about an emotional event that&apos;s special to us, whether positive or negative, the more the emotion diminishes. I can&apos;t stop wondering if my feelings towards her went up in flames because of this sort of effect. I&apos;ve thought about her and analyzed everything as thoroughly as I could and ranted about it here and asked myself why? so many times that it&apos;s all gone now.

I had completely forgotten about it and it was already 11 so initially I dropped that from my agenda before deciding that I really would do no studying for psyc so I packed up and walked over to the CULC and managed to reach to the room at 11:20. hyo jae and eric see are there, two people I see there for the first time.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">we pray several times this time over the course of the meeting, and the first time is a &quot;popcorn&quot; thing where a random person in our group would pray out loud one by one. we each voiced a prayer request and took someone else&apos;s and bowed our heads and prayed out loud and I stumbled right out of the gate when it was my turn again. it didn&apos;t help that I had a bit of mucus in my throat that I couldn&apos;t clear. I only spoke for around 20 seconds before running out and gave up before I could restart myself. I was praying for the interviews with enoch that helen and hyo jae were going to have in the afternoon and didn&apos;t dig up enough to say. even helen said more than I did.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">something david mentions to all of us is the new relationship he&apos;s in. diana is able to relate to the stresses on existing friendships the relationships bring because she has a boyfriend too.

I think back to all the times I was ever with her while hanging out off campus with a group large or small. I&apos;d look for her every chance I got and wander over to her general area only to sweep back and forth past her inconspicuously. there was always an incredibly strong and invisible barrier solid only to me that I could never hope to penetrate. I dreamt so often of being able to pierce through it. to slip past. to be able to dissolve it. it was so, so annoying. her and myself. I hated us both, but I only hated her because what I&apos;ve done with us. it was her being so out of reach. I daydreamed so often, but realized quickly enough that I am in fact not good enough for someone like her. she makes me feel so insecure and I am so riddled with holes and I don&apos;t know where to start patching myself up, or what supplies I&apos;m going to need..</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">one day I&apos;m going to conquer this feeling of needing to finish as quickly as possible and aborting at anywhere less than maximum capacity.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">there is currently less than an hour before small group starts and I won&apos;t put in the effort to arrange a meeting with my english group unless someone sends an urgent message before then.

I thought she was talking to me. nobody brought up that I wasn&apos;t present last week either. optimism leads me to assume that it&apos;s so because I&apos;ve never missed a meeting other than last time so they all automatically assume I was there too. but that just means I&apos;m unnoticed whether I&apos;m there or not.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">she brings forth a bible verse that she&apos;d found one day, but instead of simply saying something along the lines of &quot;..that I read one night&quot; she retells it as &quot;while doing my devotions last night&quot; and it&apos;s probably nothing but my frantic imagination dancing again but I wonder if was showing off to all of us that she does her devotions. it&apos;s something only I would notice and then interpret this way.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">those things, that I&apos;d thought about her that seemed attractive solely because I already liked her, aren&apos;t so attractive anymore.

I&apos;ll read them and dwell on the sincere ones. in the meantime inscribing what&apos;s in my heart only to those closest to me here. I&apos;ve learned to stop looking for contentment in social situations. it&apos;s too difficult and fleeting and unfulfilling. I&apos;m not really in search of it at all anymore and am becoming happier without it.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><hr/><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">04-19; thursday</span></div></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">yesterday afternoon after eating lunch with mike, hayson having not joined us again after bumping into us, I follow him to the crafts center in the student center, which I never knew it had. way back somewhere on the third floor is a slightly cramped but brightly lit room with walls lined with clay pottery that people were leaving out to dry. I notice a door left ajar that opens up to a darkroom. I wonder the inside of one is like. it makes me think heavily of the paradox tumblr.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">cynthia and jeff are back here with sam, who&apos;s sitting in front of a potter&apos;s wheel. unexpected. I thought he had some business to take care of, because he had told me before leaving that he had to &quot;meet someone&quot; here, without disclosing any names, even though I know jeff well enough that keeping his name hidden from me wouldn&apos;t be necessary. I learn that jeff comes here occasionally to make pottery stuff. apparently sam had just come here for fun randomly and mike was just here to join him. and make envelopes for the night&apos;s encouragement night. cynthia walks around taking pictures. mike and sam talk for a bit about my not getting any envelope from last semester&apos;s encouragement night. subject is quickly dropped. jeff and cynthia paint a cup or something that jeff had made sometime earlier.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I haven&apos;t touched clay on a potter&apos;s wheel since my trip to china in summer of 2002. 10 years. that overshoots my estimate of 6-7 years I&apos;d kept relaying to sam and mike, who had never used one before. this would only be my second time, and I consider leaving them alone but decide to not pass up the opportunity to toy with the clay. I get my hands dirty but since mike is the one sitting directly in front of the wheel I don&apos;t play around too much. the clay isn&apos;t wet enough and mike never spins the wheel fast enough to reproduce the giggle-inducing fun I&apos;d experienced about a decade ago.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">last night is ACF&apos;s encouragement night. david walks into our room through the propped open door. I walk with him to the love building, where room 185 is much emptier than it usually is on these wednesdays. hell week, steph explains. this probably turned out to be the happiest ACF night for me yet, coincidentally the one with the least attendance. diana does her best to adopt monique&apos;s quirky behavior while she recaps the semester&apos;s ACFs. I write letters to diana, ritchie, hyo jae, steph, sam, sehoon, enoch, mike, monique, and nick. I make the conscious decision to leave out several key people who&apos;ve turned out to not be such important keys, but I feel the worst for leaving out helen, who had written me something surprisingly cute. jonathan pham stops by as he&apos;d promised to basically say hi specifically to monique and no one else. steph tapes an envelope for him on the wall, then crosses his name out when she discovers with the rest of us that he had left. I didn&apos;t think she&apos;d actually do it either, but I found it rather amusing and several people remarked on the meanness of the act. I didn&apos;t care much at all, but I think I noticed her whither a little bit. it&apos;s going to take a lot more than that before people begin hating on her though. so she&apos;s safe and just fine.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">many of us didn&apos;t have time to write to all the people we wanted to, but some of us also wrote them later..steph taped one to tam&apos;s door and sam sent me one via facebook message. I was planning on doing no such thing and am thinking maybe I&apos;ll just be more open to helen from now on, something which I&apos;ve been trying to do already anyway.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">ritchie&apos;s note says that I&apos;m a different color from everyone else, helen&apos;s highlights my smile, sam&apos;s also makes note of my smile and laugh. two things I&apos;d never thought people noticed about me much. as I read them I become very glad that I poured most of my heart into the notes I&apos;d written, not leaving out much and doing my best to ensure every word had some meaning. monique sympathizes with my crushy feelings and touches upon her own, and makes sure to tell me to look up to Him. mike&apos;s is the most normal, and david&apos;s, though he didn&apos;t sign his name, gave off such a vibe that I instantly knew it was him. nick draws me a picture of an ant and tree and diana&apos;s is just enormously heartwarming. I get one letter signed with a name I can&apos;t read and I can&apos;t find out who it is. steph&apos;s would have been insanely disappointing had I not recovered in time, and simply sweetly says :tilts head:. I guess she only does it to me then. hannah thanks me for that flash drive day and prompts me to pick up the totoro picture she had drawn for me that had fallen under my bed.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">when it&apos;s over and done I walk with steph and cynthia and a new girl named melissa. I hadn&apos;t talked to her while writing and she introduces herself to me now. &apos;weird&apos; is too inadequate a description; she&apos;s one of the most eccentric people I&apos;ve ever met. her speaking mannerisms contrast so extremely with the norm and she reminds me heavily of luna lovegood in the harry potter movies, but slightly more talkative. all in a positive way, of course. she recounts a bizarre experience with some black person she sketchily walked by one night who claimed to have been shot by her husband, where she had nothing to offer her but &quot;some large apples.&quot;</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">we make our way to the restaurant chow baby, getting there a bit late. it&apos;s a buffet but I&apos;m unfamiliar with the way it works. I learn as I&apos;m in line getting food: you take a bowl and fill &apos;er up with rice or noodles or pasta and add vegetables and sauces then take a smaller bowl and fill &apos;er up with meats, then take a little wooden stick with your table number and your name that you&apos;re supposed to have written on it and wait for it all to get cooked and brought over to you. I didn&apos;t realize it was one of these. I&apos;ve been in a restaurant where someone takes food and cooks it for you but realized it worked this way too late and had already filled up my bowl with random crap and I was unsure of how it&apos;d come out tasting. I wasn&apos;t the only one to pick random stuff though. everyone is allowed two dishes and many of us here were finished with our second bowls before my first one was delivered. surprisingly jeff and david look out for me and make sure I&apos;m able to get as much food as everyone else. heartwarming gestures. it made me regret not writing something to jeff too.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">they hold each other&apos;s fingers for a few seconds while we&apos;re walking back to our cars. no problem.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I wake up this morning and look up crap on quasi experiments before walking over to today&apos;s research methods test, which felt more or less as bad as the previous two psyc tests, only shorter. meaning it&apos;s easier to get a lower grade on this one. sam never shows up.

I&apos;ve been obsessed with virtual cleanliness for a long time, ever since I was cleaning out my connections on the ipad and revoking twitter accesses. it bothers me that my heart is so discontent with something my brain knows is irrelevant. how none of this will matter in years. insecurity. what-ifs, just-in-cases. I don&apos;t want to keep anything, but can&apos;t make myself throw it all away. I wish I could stop putting so much stake in something that hardly even exists. if not here, then what? I don&apos;t really value anything else. nothing physical. my whole life is just a bunch of electrons. oh that&apos;s sad. I have to teach myself to tear myself away from this by acquiring as little as possible and resisting the temptation to buy into more. daydreaming about carrying a big clean phone around is sad and lame and I need to value something else..</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><hr/><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">04-20; friday</span></div></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I waddle over to steph&apos;s apartment dreading nothing at 11pm to work on the parts of the psyc paper taylor had decided to give us. for the first time in months I call him to open the door to let me inside. unsurprisingly we get no work done. henry comes by too and hangs with steph in her room and I don&apos;t care. I play space invaders infinity gene for over an hour. I don&apos;t know what sam is doing on his computer. he&apos;s IMing people. a couple people.

I suppose there&apos;s a possibility that he&apos;s building his own wall around me to keep me out, and if he&apos;s anything like me still, there&apos;s also a chance that it&apos;ll cave in eventually and he&apos;ll attempt to speak again. me though, I can&apos;t see myself trying much harder after the stark lack of effort he put into our last miserable conversation that he himself had started. we&apos;re both responsible for this drifting apart. sad but true. our relationship hasn&apos;t been built to last and I&apos;ve felt it steadily felt it decaying in my hands, feeble restoration efforts from either of us few and far between. I found myself almost missing him while looking his pictures on facebook the other day. or maybe I was just missing and reminiscing about high school senior year times, which his presence heavily permeated when we were close friends back then. who first stopped putting the effort into maintaining contact?

I thought [thing 2] was the one who dated her. I recall that from last year, and discussing it a bit with hayson as well. it must&apos;ve been after her relationship with sam I suppose. this was a rare kind of surprise to me that was actually shocking while thankfully not devastating at all. in fact it had a tiny tinge of pleasantness to it too..</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I keep getting glimpses of jane at the CULC.

I&apos;ve grown much closer to them, david included somewhat, than anybody else in ACF thus far. thinking of ACF immediately makes me think of them above all the other people there actually.

I order a dish with shrimp that costs twice as much as the sandwiches that everyone else ordered and contained about half as much food and I only ate about half of it. I should&apos;ve stopped considering ordering once I saw on the menu that the shrimp wasn&apos;t fried, and it turned out to be not so great a decision this time but oh well. asta goes to sleep after texting me on and off but in her last message she asks me if she was part of bring me towards God.

I&apos;d completely forgotten that there was supposed to be something that would eat up a large chunk of my sunday afternoon/evening until last night just before I went to sleep when ritchie texted me telling me he wouldn&apos;t be able to make it today. it took a moment for me to realize that this would also mean no chance of seeing jane today either. because of her I&apos;m still 1% interested and ask him if his buddies are still going, but he only tells me of this one girl who joined us at the past 2 GIGs meetings and I&apos;m not excited to go anywhere with her alone so I&apos;d rather study.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">speaking of texting david also sends me a text and I&apos;m surprised because he&apos;s simply jokingly whining about not being able to sleep. he stops responding after a few messages though. maybe he went to sleep.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I&apos;m able to get out of bed relatively early again today compared to how much I would have slept in yesterday had mike and the others not come to fetch me. jonathan pham&apos;s friend jonathan tran comes over again and they make a nice breakfast/lunch for themselves that I&apos;m not invited to. I stopped joining them in their meals a couple months ago. the last time I ate with them was back when steph and her friend had come by our room to hang out. I was really hungry then, as I always am, and it was really solely because of steph&apos;s presence that basically forced me to emerge from hiding in my room. also there were just too many people to safely ignore.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">so here&apos;s the deal with this jonathan tran. I don&apos;t like him. there&apos;s no reason for that either. it&apos;s easy to look at him the same way I look at kenny. every time I allow my eyes a fleeting glimpse of his character all I see is his oily face, his slightly chubby stomach bulging out (a little bit), his awkward stance as he stands by my roommates while they&apos;re cooking, his rough dull monotone voice, his failed enthusiasm every time he tries to blurt out a faux emotional interjection (and every time he does he picks a gross cliché). so that&apos;s what I see in him, that&apos;s all I can see. it disgusts me and I don&apos;t want to talk to him, touch him, or look at him unless I&apos;m glorifying myself and thinking down on him while I do. he clearly doesn&apos;t take a liking to me either, as evidenced by his ignoring me whenever we happen on each other on the walkways around campus. even in the narrowest of halls he deliberately concentrates his gaze away from my direction and we of course pass each other silently. I do think that &nbsp;the last time that occurred though was before the day he walked in while mike and I were watching the japanese horror movie together, when I had veggie chips out and offered him some and he took some. the next time we saw each other then, he waved and I weakly returned one.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">well it&apos;s the same sentiment for the most part with my slob of a roommate. I like looking at his disgustingly messy room, his nasty looking toothbrush, his shelf in the bathtub that&apos;s covered in gunk, his cheap toilet paper, how he always bunches up his towels when hanging them, how he seems to have his cheap headphones plugged into his ears seemingly 24/7, the stupid way he sits at the table eating junk food by himself, watching him pig out on gross crap from taco bell, his awkward conversation mannerisms and how he always brings up random topics I don&apos;t care about, the stupid neutral look on his face, his hunching over as he walks places by himself with his heavy backpacks. gosh that&apos;s a lot more than I thought I&apos;d ever held against him.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">who am I though? I&apos;m going to count the number of those ways in which I&apos;m similar and that number is well okay it&apos;s only 4-5 but that&apos;s because the first half of the list contains only small mannerisms and not the bigger qualities that truly define a person and are so difficult to edit and save. the truth about myself that I&apos;ve acknowledged but have yet to chisel into something beautiful is that there are numerous ways in which I&apos;m quite like kenny and jonathan tran. I stand stand awkwardly with my hands hanging too. the only way to feel un-awkward is to put my hands in my pockets. I spend plenty of money pigging out on plenty of unhealthy food myself. in my room alone, too, no less. I take showers late at night at 2am and sleep with my hair still wet and sneak into the bathroom naked because everyone else is asleep by the time I shower so there&apos;s little danger of being caught. I&apos;m slightly germophobic and don&apos;t like touching all these surfaces. I&apos;m in general just a very awkward kid with quirks and pet peeves normal people wouldn&apos;t ever think of and constantly violate without a second thought but which I can&apos;t stand. this is just me.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">right now I still can&apos;t stop myself from automatically generating these thoughts about those people every time I see them but what I need to do first is reevaluate myself, fix myself, and ignore all the gunk I believe is in others whether it&apos;s there or not. as long as I&apos;m satisfied with me. as long as seeing and being judgmental towards others doesn&apos;t also inevitably mean discreetly hiding my own insecurities under the bed. I&apos;m going to be getting to work on that and everything will be a lot more peaceful once it&apos;s achieved.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">can it be achieved ever..?</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><hr/><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">04-23; monday</span></div></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">starbucks is definitely getting more crowded than it usually is. dead/finals week to blame?</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">so I&apos;m sitting in those chairs on the first CULC floor feeling really self-conscious about the way I look sitting in the chair with my computer in on my lap and my wrists on the keyboard and my face blank.

I wonder if anyone is stupid enough to genuinely pray for winning a lottery. mike I think mentions that some changes God makes in our lives simply take a lot of time and we don&apos;t realize the change until it&apos;s made enough progress. that makes sense too. I wanted to say something about praying for strengthening relationships among friends and how that takes plenty of time too.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">mike and diana don&apos;t leave out the importance of a regular, daily communication channel with God that must always remain open in order to have a healthy relationship with Him, and I felt not just a twinge of guilt inside me, but also an urge to hide. a bad sign, no doubt there, as I usually have little problem admitting my faults and insecurities here and there. if asked I probably would have been fine voicing my continued troubles with prayer, but that urge to cover my body and face with my arms..I&apos;m presenting to myself one more time with a critical missing component that&apos;s keeping me and holding me. I&apos;ve been earnestly trying to be starkly honest with myself, in what I say to myself, to God, and to friends. I want to be as real as possible, but I think I might still have subconscious doubts swimming under my shallow skin that&apos;s blocking the light at the end of the tunnel of my heart. things I still have to conquer that I thought I have or have control over but remain undefeated for now.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I help close the meeting in prayer and mine is short again and the only place I&apos;m looking for reassurance is the realness with which I said all that I said.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><hr/><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">04-25; wednesday</span></div></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">after class today I walk behind a girl who a guy approaches and asks her to buy a doughnut to raise money. she politely declines &quot;no thank you&quot; and the guy politely backs away &quot;have a nice day.&quot; later I find myself walking on the same side of the walkway that their table is set up against and turn to walk around it, not trying to avoid them but still bracing myself for the asking-me-to-buy-a-donut I knew would come as the guy turned around and walked toward me &quot;would you like to buy a donut for livestrong&quot; &quot;no thanks&quot; I say. and I walk past him and he stares after me for a second before he responds &quot;have a nice day.&quot;</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I&apos;m starting to wish I had bought a donut.

I&apos;m lamenting some more right now as I&apos;m trying to sort all my lamentations into words. that never works too well either, but in there at least I&apos;m trying.

I only got one chance in the form of essay writing to achieve that, though, which I&apos;d consider a success. the two book-making assignments I took almost no part in whatsoever, especially the notecard chapbook. that reflection I&apos;ll still have to spew out bull I&apos;m afraid, but then again that entire assignment made no sense to me in the first place. hmph.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">at steph&apos;s room for the year&apos;s final small group. so we&apos;re alone for a few minutes while sam goes downstairs to fetch somebody and I&apos;m pleased to see that my concrete barrier holds firmly.

I look through the window at some of the people walking who leave before us and try to remember them, because this glimpse is last I&apos;ll get of them for a long time. it&apos;s been less than 24 hours and I&apos;ve forgotten most of them already.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">nobody gives me any hugs as we&apos;re leaving.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">david goes with steph to her room, of course.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I bid hyo jae a simple good night. I may actually have only waved at her and not said anything at all. I&apos;m left all alone in my room now but the energy continues to ring in my hears. I text mike &quot;it&apos;s a serene solitude where it&apos;s quiet all around but laughter continues to echo in your heart.&quot; well those echoes have settled quickly and even after today I can&apos;t hear them anymore.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">sam gives me his lab report, which I&apos;m satisfied with because he went out to play basketball when I thought he&apos;d be in his room where I could join him. I finish writing my psyc lab at around 3am.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">bringing me now to today.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">our research methods poster presentations are being held today and I never anticipate having to speak up during presentations with posters so I calmly stand there while the others inevitably did most of the talking. well a slightly scary incident developed when one of our group members nearly fainted without warning. she was worried about embarrassment but everyone just wanted to make sure she was fine. a cop came in and said an ambulance was on its way and she went off to see her stepmother and disappeared.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">we didn&apos;t win the competition.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I see steph from a strange angle and don&apos;t immediately recognize her and the first thing I think upon seeing her is &quot;wow a pretty asian girl.&quot; damn it. she exchanges a few words with the professor and TA. it&apos;s strange seeing and hearing her talk the same way to them as she talks to me, to us, the rest of her friends. I can&apos;t tell if reserving the same conversation mannerisms for both best friends and old teacher friends is something everybody does. I know for sure though that&apos;s it&apos;s not something I&apos;ll be able to do. I can&apos;t look at different people the same way and so can&apos;t act and speak the same way. how big a problem is that? not being to look at different people in one universal way?</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I make them wait for several minutes while I&apos;m in the bathroom changing out of my black pants into shorts. I feel a colder sort of vibe from them than I usually pick up whenever I&apos;m walking alone with the two of them. I don&apos;t understand it, don&apos;t know if it&apos;s because of anything I did, don&apos;t know how to fix it. she doesn&apos;t look at me when we walk away.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">enoch calls me as I&apos;m walking to my room. I&apos;d decided on returning to my room instead of settling at starbucks today, and turn around to meet enoch. we drive to yoforia again and talking simply with him is so much easier than it was during our first outing. I find myself very glad that I&apos;m with him, off campus, eating frozen yogurt, escaping for a while, spending a part of my afternoon away from the school setting that my tolerance for is wearing thinner every day.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">he calls diana and tells me that her small group will be hanging out by the volleyball courts and we&apos;d be free to join them. I&apos;m not so eager initially but already knew that I&apos;d join them whether I truly wanted to or not because both returning to starbucks and remaining in my room were such less desirable choices. enoch mentions while we&apos;re walking and I&apos;m holding an orange frisbee of his that he has a book to deliver to tam, hyo jae, and diana..and it&apos;s the book on sex and relationships that brian chang had promised us way back at emerge. I was the first among us to sign up for that book too. why didn&apos;t get one? I want to read about sex and relationships. enoch promises me that he&apos;ll ask about it.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">diana&apos;s small group hangout is a barbecue outside maulding. outdoors and quite a bit more fun than my small group hangout. I&apos;m not complaining about mine. just noting the difference.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">it was no surprise seeing sam and steph arrive too, but I realize they probably thought it strange to see me here. I think about how if I hadn&apos;t happened to be hanging out with enoch today, then I probably would have ended up alone at starbucks for real. while all this happiness was going on, me unneeded. mike is here too and my roommates come out as well and we all play volleyball, even myself as I shake off my unwillingness to get my feet dirty. it&apos;s been a long time since I stepped barefoot onto sand.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">david&apos;s participating in the nearly naked mile run, whatever that is (running a mile with his shirt off) and passes close by.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">she gives ethan a long hug before he leaves with mike. I find his awkwardness disgusting. what, he&apos;s standing there hunched over with his arms halfway around her back while she rests her head on him. I guess it never meant anything at all, all those (few) times she did that to me too. I can&apos;t help thinking that maybe he likes her the way I once did. thoughts following that, I&apos;m not so sure about.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I give mike a mere firm handshake before he leaves. not a hug like just before winter break.

I remember looking forward to writing sitting at a starbucks table, but God&apos;s workaround for me today turned out a lot better.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><hr/><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">04-28; saturday</span></div></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I completely forgot to write anything yesterday until 12: 40am. I remember thinking to myself about planning a break in the middle of graphics project work to write but it slipped my mind completely until sam and I had walked back to my room.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I slept through half the day yesterday waking up at 11 after going to bed at around 4. at least I wasn&apos;t starving as I slept. I&apos;d just spent nearly 5 hours or so at sam&apos;s place, eating food ordered from lucky buddha that was delivered to me by an old unfriendly asian guy and tasted cheap. but I really was hungry and I happily shared some food with sam.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">breaking: I just lied to david about the orange ipad smart cover I left in the middle of the hallway because I wanted to get rid of it but couldn&apos;t simply it toss into a garbage bin.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">we of course got none of the graphics work that we wanted to get done done. I showed him ownagepranks prank call videos on youtube and we 9gagged and I introduced the song &apos;welcome home&apos; by radical face to sam.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">if it wasn&apos;t for him I&apos;d never bother going to our last graphics lecture, which I paid no attention to anyway. sam lets me know that kelly had asked to study with us while we worked on our graphics assignment. lunch is with mike at the student center again. where a minor situation develops between us and kelly. she insists on studying in a study lounge in one of the west campus apartments, while I insist on the CULC. we all know kelly is simply too fucking lazy to take a not-even-ten-minute walk. fuck her. we don&apos;t have to acquiesce to her, I keep thinking to myself, as we&apos;re walking back to west anyway. mike&apos;s putting allison&apos;s phone back together when kelly doesn&apos;t answer the text I send her about going to the CULC but instead tells sam that she&apos;ll be studying with somebody else instead, ditching us completely. that bitch.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">several things about kelly annoy me, but that quality above is perhaps the single source of the dislike I harbor towards her. she seemingly abandons ship as quickly and eagerly as she hops on board. she&apos;d jumped on board my boat very quickly at the beginning of my freshman year. taking me by surprise as I apparently made my first close-ish friend at school. after bursting through four years of high school that were filled with disappointing, fake people who hadn&apos;t learned how to be themselves yet, I wasn&apos;t sure what to make of somebody who at the very beginning was, quite unusually, friendly and caring. could she really have nothing but a kind heart powering her?</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">she invited me to spend some time with her at starbucks during one of the first weeks of school. I of course got overexcited and sent unnecessary facebook posts to her wall and spam texted her with messages my deranged self believed were funny. during our second small group meeting that year she asked everyone what day it was and I was surprised when she actually set time aside for it being my birthday. she&apos;d made a card for me, had all the ACF leaders sign it, almost none of whom I knew at all back then, and passed the card around to all present at small group that week to sign too. in it she had written &quot;I pray that we will have a good bonding time at starbucks on friday!&quot; that friday we not only didn&apos;t go to a starbucks (pinkberry instead) but steph and david chang joined us as well. so there she was starting to sink my ship already.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">but she&apos;d already become my tugboat and I felt the despair as she detached herself from me. she abruptly (it felt very sudden to me) stopped talking to me (she actually texted me first one day. then stopped replying after only a few exchanges), on facebook and in person. I&apos;d become so easily and quickly attached to her and had tricked myself into thinking she liked me. maybe even had a crush on me, because no one like her, no one I&apos;d known for so short a time, had ever initialized anything with me before. for a few ACF meetings she&apos;d get up and eagerly wave and smile at me, and I&apos;d return with a sloppy wave while stupidly standing right in front of her. I became attached to her even though I didn&apos;t find her attractive, which I thought at first was a good thing. but to me she&apos;s proven herself to be just as disappointing as I was fearing she&apos;d be in the end, maybe even more so because of how much higher I&apos;d climbed this time. she has a boyfriend now and I&apos;m thinking he must be pretty great, if he&apos;s able to get along with someone I can&apos;t stand.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">terminating thoughts early after today&apos;s toilet incident.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><hr/><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">04-29; sunday</span></div></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">today is my last sunday here at school. last weekend. the last day I&apos;ll be going to any church for a long time. the last day I&apos;ll be spending in my room by myself with the blinds down, with my towel hanging in front of my window to block out the light. feeling detached from the rest of campus and the world, knowing there are so many things going on around me but not knowing what they are. the center of the circle, the only part that doesn&apos;t move when it rotates.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">counterargument yes this is finals week so there is less happening than usual.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I wonder how many people I&apos;ve already seen the last of for this school year. I don&apos;t remember saying a good-bye to anyone except mike and diana. and I only hugged diana. I regret not giving her a full embracing hug.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">something about me and hugging. I&apos;ve thought to myself that my arms just never seem to fit right. steph is the only person who I can think of hugging and when I do it&apos;s short and gives me no time to think. according to michelle, who actually lent me the opportunity to &quot;analyze&quot; my arms fitting, it&apos;s probably because of my height. well given steph&apos;s size, that&apos;s no surprise.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">my arms will fit perfectly around the person who wants to hug me as badly as I want to hug her.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">sam I&apos;ll be riding with all the way to the end of the tunnel this time. if all goes according to yet-to-be-made plans, I&apos;ll actually be watching the hunger games with him on wednesday.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I didn&apos;t really say bye to any of the people who were in our apartment on friday night, who sam and I joined after abandoning graphics work. he prepared a panini for me but I apologized and told him I truly had no appetite, so he ate it. I found that I genuinely preferred to sit alone in my room with no lights on than to try to join their conversations. david and sam drop by my room several times to come talk to me even though I refused to talk to them (the group, not them specifically). I don&apos;t think I gave off a cold unwelcoming atmosphere, but they couldn&apos;t stay forever in any case so they came and went. tam&apos;s computer sends shitty asian pop music through the speakers.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">hannah and her boyfriend leave before steph and david. she says bye to me without peeking into my room and consequently I don&apos;t answer. her I won&apos;t see again. steph and david peek into my room and she says a good night. I say a good night. I can&apos;t see her face. they leave. I won&apos;t see her again either.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">but I think I might have spotted her walking into sixth street with him holding hands again. she was in a purple dress. I&apos;ve never seen her in person with the purple dress, and I don&apos;t know why she&apos;d be wearing such a formal dress, but it&apos;s still possible that she was her.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I&apos;m going to have some fun thinking about lisa now. we both failed hard at arranging even a single time to hang out. she was the one of us who suggested we study together some time in the first place. I hadn&apos;t ever brought it up because I&apos;d assumed she wouldn&apos;t be interested. I was a little surprised way back sometime in february when she happily threw out a &quot;we should study together!&quot; and said I could text her whenever because, as she reminded me, she&apos;s bad at initiating text conversations. mhm. the only time we had a set day I had made a mistake and wasn&apos;t free when I thought I would be so I had to be the plan-canceler for once. she surprised me again by assuring me there&apos;d be no problem and we could always just meet during the next week! no texts to or from either of us after that. we&apos;re just going to slip away from each other now.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">ritchie texts me today. church at 6? okay. I still haven&apos;t even begun studying for the three finals that, no matter what happens, I&apos;ll be done with in 52 hours from now. desperately hoping motivation will leak in from a source..</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">I wonder if I&apos;ll see jane again today.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">so I&apos;ll be seeing ritchie again after all. I bumped into him leaving my room on friday night (apparently he had joined the party too) so that was already once more after I thought we&apos;d said a final good-bye.</span></div><div><span style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><br/></span></div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<div><br/></div><div><div>four days ago</div><div><br/></div><div>first things first: last friday, vince opened the door for me and said &quot;hey dan&quot; without looking at me. i can't remember any other time he's spoken to me. i wore my blue plaid shirt, the one i got last summer because it kind of reminds me of patrick, and steph remembered it. i stayed by the door with alex and ritchie because i didn't want to listen to the worship music. i told ritchie that my hair is almost as long as his. ritchie and i, we have nothing to talk about. enoch talked again, and for a little while i hated listening to his drivel enough to ask v if he wants to know what ACF is like (but i ultimately didn't carry through). people like allison sat and listened, and i'd like to think that they'll forget. takuto fell asleep. i was scared again. i thought about how &quot;different&quot; people (enoch explained that to be &quot;holy&quot; means to be different) like &quot;us&quot; are really, in the end, the same as everyone else, and only in a different way. this is what we're constantly surrounded by and what we have known for a long while, if not for our whole lives. how is it up to us to say that we're right?</div><div><br/></div><div>i sat next to enoch at the vietnamese restaurant we all went to, the closest proximity to him i've been in for such a long time. i can confirm that the closeness we shared during late last spring is gone. at sweet hut, i bought a taro milk tea because that's what i saw lydia get a week ago. there's a newer girl named emily who's been coming out here. i'm tired of david telling me when he farts and has to poop. is that all there is?</div><div><br/></div><div>i'll expect a max of 3 sincere encouragement letters to me. i think i'm going to write five: one to monique, mike, sam, david, and that's all, so i guess four, actually. how sad.</div><div><br/></div><div>there weren't many people in the center street activity room afterwards, i'd wonder if it had been this empty for long, but i remembered that everyone had gone to the parking deck instead. helen picked an animated 1972 movie called the rescuers for us to watch. it was a nice movie about mice rescuing a kidnapped girl, and there were several moments when monique turned to me when i laughed at the same funny parts at the same time as she, and we'd look at each other for several seconds before i couldn't stand her eyes anymore. i guess steph was tired while we were walking back, because she practically went comatose. i hope she was just tired, because i absolutely hate it when she goes quiet like that.</div><div><br/></div><div>there will be two more ACF meetings before school ends, which means, and this is weird to think about, that i will see everybody only twice more until the next school year . possibly three times. i don't think anybody is going to miss me this time. i've already been gone all year. and i'm sorry.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><hr/>
; 4-22 mon
<div><br/></div><div>three days ago</div><div><br/></div><div>this will be a mess.</div><div><br/></div><div>there were a lot of envelopes on the wall. i was happy when mo called out my name when i walked inside...i only wrote four letters, and they were inevitably less sincere than i would have liked, for as predicted i did not draft anything to say to the people who i care about most. they were all apologetic and i hope i that not too much of what i wrote was too whiny.</div><div><br/></div><div>i'll put what other people wrote to me here later. some were from unexpected people. and of course, people told me that jesus loves me. i didn't write to steph again, and she wrote to me again. she remembers what i had told her about looking like a squirrel two years ago. and i'm sorry i didn't write anything to her again. i can't let the virtual continue to dictate how my life runs.</div><div><br/></div><div>dinner felt kind of special somehow. i think it was because we ate at don quixote, which feels like a signature ACF place because it's been the first restaurant of choice to go to every year. i rode with , , and , none of whom i usually talk to at all, so it was different. yet maybe i did more talking than i would have if i sat with people i think i feel more comfortable with.</div><div><br/></div><div>that movie night is, i think, sufficient evidence for me to conclude that parts of my mind are too firmly rooted in certain parts of reality reality is not the best word i don't know what the best word is. the movie is 'click' and mo cried during the emotional climax but i couldn't clear the hurdle.</div><div><br/></div><div>i haven't seen sam since that night. in my letter to him i said sorry for being a crappy friend.</div><div><br/></div><div>one of the biggest surprises i've gotten in aeons</div><div><br/></div><div>jessie posted on my wall after she saw a post of mine about dead space. it's been over a year since i last texted her about playing dead space 2. she promised to find time to catch up with me come fall, but then told me to remind her in case she might &quot;forget.&quot; how do you forget something like that? i must not let her get inside my head again. our comment thread went as it always used to when we would talk. i looked at our facebook friendship and it's strange how completely i've forgotten her and how i used to interact. who in ACF remembers her? the end of our conversation is signified by her liking my last comment.</div><div><br/></div><div>on saturday i went with these people to stone mountain: mike, louisa, chris, david, christina, andrew, vince, jared, billy, ritchie. on the way up, louis told me that her father is angry with her for being baptized because he's an atheist. she talks to her mother regularly, but it's been a while with her dad. i think i've already heard of this, but i don't remember if she told me herself one day or if it was while i was a bystander in another conversation.</div><div><br/></div><div>billy always looks at me and at least tries to say hi to me. here my role is switched; i'm the usually the one frustrated that no one does this to me. here i don't appreciate it for a moment.</div><div><br/></div><div>we ate at jason's deli after we climbed back down and i sat at the end of a row of 4 tables we joined together and thought about how this was something small, but something i wouldn't have wanted to miss. and it would have been quite easy to miss. i considered it just for a minute, in favor of playing dead space 3 with an obnoxious player who must have been around 13 years old. how could i?</div><div><br/></div><div>neither christina nor i said bye to the other when mike dropped us off.</div><div><br/></div><div>while i was shopping at target yesterday i ran into a guy who stopped and asked me if i went to tech (it must have been because of my &quot;ninja coder&quot; shirt). i thought about tumblr jessie and how she says she wants to trust strangers. i came up with so many what-ifs, but ended up giving him my name, email, and phone number for him to contact me by because he's looking for students to work with or something like that. i wonder if this is an opportunity, or what.</div><div><br/></div><div>today i found a buzz card on the ground and took it to the west campus housing office. paco was working there again, i saw him just as i was hoping that he wouldn't be there. maybe i said &quot;see ya&quot; too abruptly. he seemed a little...i don't know. maybe he wanted to ask me how i've been, too.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 4-26 fri</div><div><br/></div><div>Dan Dan Dan the man. Aw yee I'm writing this side- ways. Dude, thanks for watching Beginners w/ me! It's a beautiful movie. I'm so glad to know someone who likes the same stuff as me :) Keep your chin up, mang. You are loved. Find- ing God cannot be forced, but it will happen, I know. Praying for you ~</div><div><br/></div><div>Mo - (realized I already wrote my name ... )</div><div>Dan, Hey man! Didn't see you as much this semester. Hope your semester was good and I pray that you find strength and peace in God. Good luck on your finals and see you next year! -Chris</div><div><br/></div><div>Dan, I've missed you this semester. Sorry I'm always too busy. Glad you're here tonight and hopefully we can catch up a bit. See you around next semester? David</div><div><br/></div><div>Dan , Danny-o Hey man I encourage you to fallback on God's provision and this community during your lows as well as your highs. Never stop growing in your relationships with the individuals He has placed in your life. It's been a great 3 years man and I am eager to hear of how you'll grow in the future. Peace friend. - Mike Y</div><div><br/></div><div>To Dan: Hey Dan! How have you been =). I haven't heard from you too much (I haven't been around too often either haha). Anyways, I hope that you've been having a good school year! Good luck on finals and have a good summer ~ I hope that this note doesn't sound too genuine. XD. God bless -Nick Wang</div><div><br/></div><div>DAN I NEVER GOT TO SEE YOU (well, hardly.) SO SAD. WHY YOU NO COME MUCH AT BEGINNING of semester? (I don't know why i switched from all CAPS to lowercase). I still remember that you told me I reminded you of a squirrel for some reason in your frist encouragement note to me Freshman year. COME OUT MORE SO I CAN SEE YOU MORE! Jesus loves you. Trust in that =) - Steph</div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday I felt a little bit more alive. after finding only three other people in the psyc classroom when i walked in, and after one of them left and another came, one suggested that we collaborate as a study group for the final. so far no one's edited the google doc that he shared, and i'll have to wait until tuesday or so to see how this turns out. none of us had gotten any no-class memo, and they all left the room before me so i was the only person sitting in the classroom for a short while.</div><div><br/></div><div>in my next class i found that the grade i received on exam 2 was at least 20 points higher than i had expected. so that's good news.</div><div><br/></div><div>i followed through on hanging out with david and a small crew, poolside. no one swam much at all, but there wasn't really anything to do in the recreational pool anyway, besides going on the water slide. all they wanted to do was lay down outside in the sun. i never liked doing that, so i tried swimming laps and managed to finish a grand total of 7 before my right arm cramped up completely. i went outside after that, and ritchie showed us a picture of himself in high school, dressed as Simba. we left together after i said i would.</div><div><br/></div><div>and i wanted to go right back to my room, as i had become so accustomed to doing, but made the hesitant decision to stay with ritchie, steph, and mo. they wanted to go to some ULC housing event that had free food. i hadn't been in steph's living room since the beginning of the year. while mo was in the shower, ritchie and steph were just on their phones and it was silent for most of the time. steph read us something from buzzfeed. i was only kind of bored, but i would definitely have been more miserable if i did have my phone with me. so i was glad i didn't have it. sam came by. because they had been talking about smoothies, and a bunch of other nearby places that i had once again never heard of. i was lost, but it was a little okay because at least i was there to be lost. mo said that this was &quot;just like old times.&quot; i don't know what usually happens between them now, but that hit home. this had been just like old times for me too.</div><div><br/></div><div>sam drove us to smoothie king and five guys is right next door so i was able to satisfy that craving too, conveniently. we went to the ULC event together with roommate eric and a guy i don't know. there was greek food and jamaican food i don't like plantains. it became more of a normal social situation for me then, with everyone talking to other people somehow, while i was sitting idly. jose and hannah came by too. no greetings exchanged, but it didn't matter. jose asked me about ashley rodriguez and we gossiped about her over things that happened almost a year ago. i told them that she had made out with at least three different people while abroad, even though i was only certain of two. i also got a massage. decided to say yes, it narrowly edged out my default no after everybody else i knew also signed up for one. this has to be because i have no clue how to start a conversation, but ritchie never paid attention to me when i tried to engage him. this used to be easier.</div><div><br/></div><div>then i joined their study group, we were walking around klaus looking for empty rooms and they kept talking about a &quot;the room&quot; and that annoyed me slightly. i thought i couldn't study with them, so i didn't. after neither playing dead space 3 or left 4 dead 2 would work, i stopped and prepared to leave them. this was at 11. steph said she'd go with me. and yes, that would've made me excited a while ago. but we're past that now. helen came with us, and steph was mostly in her quite state again, and she was sleepy, she said. we shared a couple funny stories on the way.</div><div><br/></div><div>if only i could gauge how often they congregate like so? i'm glad i didn't miss it this time, but i don't think my presence there with them had any significant effect on them. i have no presence.</div><div><br/></div><div>; 11:07 pm est</div><div><br/></div><div>tonight i fell in love with ACF a second time.</div><div><br/></div><div>i had myself checked when tam announced that it was actually nice to see faces that haven't showed up in a while. i had been thinking the opposite.</div><div><br/></div><div>when the videos were presented, mine was shown first. a few different people came up to me and told me that they liked it. that means something.</div><div><br/></div><div>the end of chapter three is perhaps the saddest so far, because this time the people whose times are up are ones with whom i've gotten to spend more time with than i have with the past seniors. enoch mentioned that he was part of the ACF that was here long ago, and that it's become a much more closer-knit community. the word Community came up quite often. and i thought, its story will continue. only the chapters end. the past will reappear. and the people in it will be right where they have always been.</div><div><br/></div><div>yan and jennifer only asked me to take some pictures for them with sam in it.</div><div><br/></div><div>it sucks when you want to talk to someone so badly but have nothing to say to them. after all this time?</div><div><br/></div><div>strong emotions. i'll be sure to attach them to songs that i can relive these days by.</div><div><br/></div></div></en-note>      ]]>

4-1 t
<div><br/></div><div>Today I held hands with Riccel. In the pool, as part of the guard workout, you understand. I couldn't let my thoughts stray, had to keep them in control, but my is she a cute person. When she was towing me in her vice grip during the relay segment she kept spitting water in my face, and I didn't mind. When we were all sitting in the hot tub, she sang a bit of &quot;Don't You Want Me.&quot; These are simply observations. She also kept getting ignored. I heard most of what she said, but didn't respond to much. Next time, be more receptive. And, I'm sure she isn't sad anyway.</div><div><br/></div><div>I grabbed some cotton candy for myself after watching a lone girl do the same. Seeing other singular people comforts me, possibly a bit selfishly. Even though it's only for seconds, I know I'm not alone in my loneliness. (Expand on this)</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
4-4 f</div><div><br/></div><div>The opening shift at the pool with Austin R. and Nadia again.</div><div><br/></div><div>A man in the library took photos of me for the yearbook. I kept laughing, almost, while sitting and looking at the camera.</div><div><br/></div><div>So-called &quot;senior night&quot; at ACF. Because the topic is a deviation from the usual type of material, I found it much easier to pay attention. Ritchie, Helen, and Steph spoke about their experiences and what they had learned, and the things I heard felt relevant for once. Ritchie talked about relationships and what he had to say ran parallel to much of my recent thought. Steph encouraged us all to remember that what we do, we do for God, so I didn't understand quite as much. And Helen reminded me that there is a universe inside every soul. She even cried a little bit. I had definitely never recognized her as a soul before.</div><div><br/></div><div>Louisa was on her phone the whole time. I said a total of 2 words to Monique. Christina and I had a conversation in Louisa's car. Jared is not assertive, and he's very soft, of course. Funny how I long so hard for human interaction, only to instinctively attempt to end it once given the opportunity.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
4-7 m</div><div><br/></div><div>I missed class today because I overslept.</div><div><br/></div><div>Small group was at Vince's apartment today only because Monique was away. I should have known that there would be an apparent reason. She never said anything about it, but that doesn't matter. Speaking of her, I saw her mother and sister at Sweet Hut on Friday. They appeared not to recognize me, and it took me time to identify them as well. However Ritchie and a couple of others were known to them. And I was not about to make any notion to reveal myself. <strike>to them.</strike></div><div><strike><br/></strike></div><div>Water and stress</div><div><br/></div><div>The Sixth Street apartment harkened back to my earlier days, the kinds that I'm glad are in the past. It was something remotely unpleasant, distinctly undesirable.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
4-8 t</div><div><br/></div><div>I guess Dan Brady isn't really a friend, then.</div><div><br/></div><div>There are only 25 days remaining. Until World 1-1. Monique has not been reciprocating my <u>   ????  </u> , but have I been reciprocating hers?</div><div><br/></div><div>On Saturday, Clement was teaching me how to throw a football. And a frisbee, because for some reason I can't throw a backhand anymore.</div><div><br/></div><div>Seeing the people I think (in various ways) about is beginning to feel unreal. Today there was Riccel, Ashley, and Cheyenne. In a few weeks, this will all pass. It'll be like nothing ever happened, and I won't remember any of it.</div><div><br/></div><div>Yesterday Jennifer invited me to China Care charity dinner. Reasons unknown, but I decided I'd try to make it. Who knows why she reached to me, though. Maybe I'll see some people there, people who I once thought cared about me.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
4-9 w</div><div><br/></div><div>Maybe &quot;ROdNEY&quot; is lonely. Maybe that's why he keeps messaging me. The idea reminds me of the part in &quot;Walk Two Moons&quot; when they call the lonely army vet who kept talking. I don't want that to be me. It's my worst fear.</div><div><br/></div><div>The first story to show up on my Facebook newsfeed today was the one announcing Elizabeth's new relationship. After last night's dream, I find it to be a most amusing coincidence. Is it a good thing, that I can laugh?</div><div><br/></div><div>Saw Yan at the food trucks today. She asked me about my post-graduate plans, because that's all you want to know about a soon-to-be-graduate's life. There was nothing else for her to ask. She kept recognizing people, and that made me want to leave.</div><div><br/></div><div>Monique is another sunken ship. I want to abandon her. I want to ignore her. I'm tired of being relentless. Do I sap energy? If she goes, everything goes. Asta says she knows how I feel.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
4-13 n</div><div><br/></div><div>A writing hiatus takes its toll. I will try to remember as much as I can.</div><div><br/></div><div>I think I'm the only senior who didn't speak in front of ever[y]body. The senior is one perspective change I haven't really noticed. Monique's and Louisa's speeches were really merely their life stories. I guess Louisa's and Chris's breakup wasn't permanent. Monique talked about the things in her life that she had already detailed to me. Am not sure if I should be feeling honored. I detected not her messages, but a fruitless attempt to send them, and I for one doubt anybody in our small crowd would ever be able to receive them as she intended. I did not listen closely to Louisa because her story did not apply to me.</div><div><br/></div><div>But when Tam spoke, oh my. I think he was the one God really spoke through that evening. I kept gazing at the heads while the first two were talking, but I found Tam riveting. Guess I never paid attention to how he always made the announcements (and maybe he has experience from China Care as well), but my eyes also opened once again to the fact that he was still a &quot;victim&quot; of my groundless hate, the kind born out of the arrogance and childishness that began plaguing me two years ago. The last remaining bits crumpled to dust then, and I found all too late a new respect for him. Other reminders: the distinct universe unique to each person, containing all means of struggle and resulting growth. The worst part is that I'd <u>completely</u> forgotten that his mother had passed away. Where had I been then? What trivial shit had I been thinking about? Only afterwards was able to recall how he had made his announcement initially. &quot;Thank you for sharing,&quot; I thought, but he'll never hear those words from me.</div><div><br/></div><div>I went to La Fonda in spite of myself, and realized that I had zero things to talk about with Clement. This isn't a problem specific to him, but he makes it very apparent. I said little to anybody for the whole dinner, and didn't feel like smiling. I even made a couple attempts. David showed up, and I was the only one unhappy.</div><div><br/></div><div>On the way to the student center, I encountered Riccel and two of her friends. We didn't acknowledge each other. This needs attention. They were on their way to another event.</div><div><br/></div><div>Jennifer with kids at the China Care dinner. Phammy with kids at the China Care dinner. In this setting, I looked at Jennifer and Tam, and saw the depths of the ocean, of outer space.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
4-14 m</div><div><br/></div><div>I refused any entry at the pool this morning, sitting next to a pretty girl whose perfume I got a strong whiff of. The static has nearly never been more noticeable. I wish I hadn't, but it's so much easier said. I listened to Ashley talk a lot.</div><div><br/></div><div>Followed up with Lisa about the coffee. Tried to pay attention to her.</div><div><br/></div><div>Waved at Katie Delgado.</div><div><br/></div><div>                         danger</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
4-17 r</div><div><br/></div><div>Honestly, nothing has happened these past few days. I think I haven't talked to another human for two weeks</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
4-19 s</div><div><br/></div><div>Lisa and I had what I imagine to have been a decent standard talk. As usual, she was active most of the time, and I was still pretty dissatisfied with my performance, though it was not completely terrible. I just needed something to do with my hands. She was late and I wouldn't have cared if she actually forgot to show up, but afterwards I wanted to keep in touch with her. That was one of the things we talked about. What I need to keep in mind most is to not think too hard about what to say. Maybe she thinks of me differently from how I think of her. Maybe we still have a chance at survival.</div><div><br/></div><div>I never drafted any encouragement letters, and I let my meeting with Lisa run late, so I had little time to write to all whom I wanted. Glancing around at my select golden people, I realized I had very little to say to them, which sucked of course. Ended up writing whatever may or may not have s ounded right, which wouldn't make sense to them anyway. At Five Guys, I learned to not try to be funny. Still doesn't work.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
4-21 m</div><div><br/></div><div>Every day feels like a weekend now. I am deeply thankful for the rare times when I am able to click with Asta, Monique, and V.</div><div><br/></div><div>Observations:</div><div><br/></div><div>Jonathan Pang looking the freshman part, but only somewhat behaving the part, to me. Vince talking about himself for a little bit and Monique not seeming very interested. Me, becoming distinctly uncomfortable at Chow Baby when a large group of (Asian) people walked in. They were celebrating someone's birthday? Monique knew a few of them. Monique, swearing seemingly inadverdently. We discussed citizenship, during which I realized there was nothing standing in my way but myself, and alcohol, during which Monique dropped a lot of knowledge and Vince seemed to try to, which was surprising. I don't think Jasmine talked THAT much. I'm not sure. Monique and I always talk about movies and Jessie and sometimes books and music. The same books and music. She played HER music on the way back, almost hit somebody with her car, and at the end I said, &quot;You have yourself a good night.&quot; and that was that.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
4-22 t</div><div><br/></div><div>The in-service meeting was the single event of importance today. Many of the faces in the sea are now familiar, and will remain ever briefly so. I wonder how many faces I saw for the last time tonight. Mindy, Nica, Riccel, Dan Brady, Brustad, Filipe, Kwiley, among others. Felt strange to write their names down. To acknowledge that they were ever in my life. It felt like a sunset, perhaps closer to dusk. I'm not working with anybody interesting tomorrow, and the finals week schedule isn't out yet. Maggie Jensen won an award. She was recognized a lot overall. Contrast against I, who will slip away unnoticed, perhaps never having been a real member of the family. I'm completely fine with going out with no bang. I miss the competition pool as I think about it, and wish I had music that evoked memories of it. Tomorrow morning I will be paying as much attention as I can.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>4-23 w</div><div><br/></div><div>Ashley actually talked to me today! I'm guessing she couldn't ignore her proximity warning any longer as I was sitting next to her instead of across the table. She inquired about finals and I fed her the usual spiel. To some of her lines I could only return null. Jermaine is kind of awkward. Dan A. is definitely a little immature. I stole a small plastic thing that must have been used to measure the pool chemicals.</div><div><br/></div><div>Zora informed me that at an unspecified earlier point in time, she had been raped and forced to perform fellatio on an unknown subject. I don't know if I believe her. I'd be doing her a disservice not to. I've no reason not to.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
4-25 f</div><div><br/></div><div>Ramblin' On was rather lackluster, in my opinion. If I hadn't gone, there wouldn't have been much to miss anyway. I had to reach out to Ritchie to ensure that I wouldn't be alone. He arrived with Mo and they incessantly traded cracks at each other about enjoying alcohol and not being old enough to drink it, respectively. I forgot how to be, in with all of the people. Mo and Ritchie knew a lot more people than I did. Gabe Pajares didn't recognize me. On what could be considered the last day of school, I finally set foot in the actual stadium. I saw Kwiley and Yusuf. I saw Rachel Hutto. I saw Sheng. I saw Lisa. (we merely waved) Sally appeared. The margartias were bad I wanted to leave for most of the time. I thought I'd prefer ACF, but found that I forgot what the stadium looked like almost as soon as I walked out. Monique stated that she had had rum beforehand which confirms my earlier detections. I hear her talking a lot about drinking. It must be a just-beginning-to-drink thing.</div><div><br/></div><div>The potluck was attended by relatively few, and there I found that I was perfectly happy sitting on my own while everyone else talked. Clement invited me to his senior seminar thing, so guess what, I'm going. I sat next to Steph, and we made several contact high-fives. I wonder what it feels like to put your arms around a living, breathing person, and to hold them there.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
4-26 s</div><div><br/></div><div>Monique drove me, Christina, Helen, and Henry to Clement's apartment, which is in the same complex as David's. Her black areas appear to be increasing. I'm not sure if the fault lies with me or her.</div><div><br/></div><div>Clement had many bottles, so IF I'd had any perconceptions, they would have been wrong. Of course none of them have had any significat experience (except Monique) with alcohol. Tell me why this is such a big deal again? (It is not) He also talked about how to manage money, including useful tips such as to buy used cars. I don't think he wrote any of it.</div><div><br/></div><div>I was a stranger in their home</div><div><br/></div><div>The guards at the pool today included Katie, Nica, Dan Brady, and Austin Milton. I may have seen them all for the final time today. I am trying to bear this in mind for all guards, but that's impossible, without paper. Nica warned me about the circumstances favoring a potential VAT, and ironically got VAT'd herself. Three times.</div><div><br/></div><div>Jerry was a stupid mistake, a chance to say no simply went undetected.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>4-27 n</div><div><br/></div><div>Scattered thunderstorms today, and two girls splashed around in puddles in the ULC courtyard. How fun, I thought. I was holding an umbrella.</div><div><br/></div><div>I quickly put together a playlist I'm planning on using for the contiguous drive home. I wonder what the good-byes will be like. Year 1 is skipped because I don't have enough songs for then, and also nothing important happened then anyway.</div><div><br/></div><div>Anjaly appeared at the table I was studying at. I should have put more effort into my hug. How do you think she perceives me? She never did text me &quot;for lunch&quot; and I'm pretty [sure] she has a different phone number now. She pointed out a boy as her boyfriend and that was all I could think about for the next of the night. She patted and ruffled my hair. I'm going to ask her to hang out one more time. I don't really know why I've nothing to say about her to Asta, either.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
4-28 m</div><div><br/></div><div>Today was the beginning of an end. Whoever came up with that first must have felt so creative.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
4-30 w</div><div><br/></div><div>It's so tempting to judge and misjudge new people. Best to just refrain. David's dad's funeral was today, and I didn't go.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
5-1 r</div><div><br/></div><div>Today I worked my last ever shift at the pool. Amanda Foutch is one of the friendlier people. Ashley smiled at me, a pointed smile. I never got to say good-bye to Kwiley. Likely permanent final sighting. I've been thinking a lot about the last of things, and they aren't really different from the first times.</div><div><br/></div><div>That principle applies to Steph's brunch event as well.  I'll see my fellow graduates one more time, though as for the rest of them only God knows (unspoken). The list goes on.</div><div><br/></div><div>I left them for Lisa, and her being filled with optimism raised the hope flag once more. I looked at us two, sitting on the bench, who we once were, who we are now. Tried not think about others' judgments. I did a little bit better today, but I always need to keep the wild animal in check as it loves to run too much. The full extent of her exploitations is simply not my business. I should direct attention to staying alive. Think we have a chance. We did sit and walk and talk for a pleasant amount of time. If God is okay with it, we may see each other in New York soon. I'd like to tell that story.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
5-2 f</div><div><br/></div><div>Here we are. The night you've all been waiting for? Is it anything like what you imagined it would be? Everybody is sad, everyone melancholy. It came sooner than expected. I tried communications with Lisa and Monique, which didn't work out (neither).</div><div><br/></div><div>And so this stage transcends into a ghost story. I walked around campus for a while, alone in the empty. My mind populated it with ghosts. I visited my mailbox, the area in the CULC where I called Jessie that one time, Starbucks...ghosts everywhere. Add term to dictionary.</div><div><br/></div><div>I must have experienced these feelings prior to departure from Barcelona as well.</div><div><br/></div><div>At the Chinese restaurant I went with my dad to for dinner, I ran into Henry Ung. I'll let that speak for itself.</div><div><br/></div><div>I might be able to count the number of times I've driven on campus on one hand, still. On the way back, I took the exit to 10th street. Then I drove down 6th. I definitely want to spend my last night in my dorm. The last. The last of it all.</div><div><br/></div><div>Nothing will happen tomorrow.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><div><b>4-17 f</b></div><div><br/></div><div>last</div><div>night</div><div>there was limited debate in my mind concerning if I should go to joystick gamebar. I RSVP&apos;d while still at work thinking I could just cancel if I changed my mind. paced around in my room for at least twenty minutes before leaving.</div><div><br/></div><div>I noticed Krish because he is short and the first thing I said was, &quot;hey dude.&quot; I don&apos;t think he recognized me until I told him I was there with the group, the very small group. no shortage of self-consciousness here. Abbey, recognized, had arrived already and she knew my name. likely from the RSVP list though, and not because she actually remembered me from last year. I said I was about to ask her if she remembered. I don&apos;t remember. they talked about the yoga places they like to go to. I asked them about their yoga and nodded a lot. a Patrick joined but didn&apos;t stay long. while he was here I asked if anyone had seen the second star wars episode vii teaser. there was no reason to ask that question. during this time Sam replied to my text.</div><div><br/></div><div>&nbsp;a Marcus and an Alex joined soon after that and then things started rolling like a katamari. we moved over to a larger table after somehow meeting two women over a decade older than us. they talked about the oregon trail (the game), using computers at school as they became widespread, and trapper keepers. I just looked up trapper keepers and they aren&apos;t what I thought they were during the discussion. the two women handed out their business cards and I&apos;m sorry but I stuck it between the couch cushions because I didn&apos;t want it.</div><div><br/></div><div>I &nbsp;am &nbsp;still &nbsp;terrible &nbsp;at &nbsp;pretending &nbsp;to &nbsp;be &nbsp;normal</div><div><br/></div><div>someone named Greg came over, just sat down and started talking to us. he&apos;s french and is here for his bachelor party. getting married on may 2. exactly one year from the day I graduated from college (completely irrelevant). Greg is one of those guys who exudes dominance and friendliness without ever smiling. he keeps saying he&apos;ll find Krish a girl. more people are coming in behind us as the night rolls and smiling starts to suck. I want to say all about being buzzed and paying too much attention every time Abbey&apos;s knee accidentally touched mine. dismiss all. at one point I found myself with her and Krish in a darker corner of the room and watched Marcus interact with the rest of the girls and boys &nbsp;by the table. one particularly cute one was called Kendra and another Amanda. what was your initial, irreversible reaction? well, Krish and Abbey were paying attention. I don&apos;t know what I was looking at. Abbey, maybe? my buzzed self opened some gates. I think they asked me it had to be something about what I do in my spare time because I started talking about my &quot;three-thousand-dollar computer.&quot; it&apos;s actually closer to $3,500 but whatever. I think you just wanted to brag about it, why else would you bring it up? oh, the katamari really picked up your mouth on this one. I even started talking about water cooling. Abbey even asked me about it and I had to explain (sloppily) the difference between air and water cooling. why would she ask me about that?</div><div><br/></div><div>by the bar, some time around when Krish bought us some kind of lemon slushie shot, I asked her to let me know if she ever wanted to do anything outside of meetup. she just kind of nodded before returning to the back. I ended up talking with one of Greg&apos;s friends, &quot;Doshy&quot; (?). the normal questions. he was friendly enough. I was in a daze. Krish talking to a female bartender. who did Abbey have her knees pointed at? incessantly trying to gauge Abbey&apos;s perception of me. her just being, is all it takes. Kendra and Amanda left and I waved good-bye and was kind enough to include a smile. then outside, a little after midnight. Alex and Krish encouraging Marcus to go back inside to get a girl&apos;s number. apparently he was successful. at the pizza place we finally went to after talking about it all night, we debated how long he should wait before texting her. at least he got the girl&apos;s number. even gave his number to Abbey, claiming to be interested in volleyball. I felt smaller rushes of relief whenever Abbey laughed at something I said.</div><div><br/></div><div>I ended up driving Krish and Abbey home, as promised. didn&apos;t recognize either of the places I dropped them off at as residences. it was almost surreal. driving with near-strangers at 1 in the morning. I gave Krish my number so he could let me know about sweet hut. is it going to happen? we&apos;ll see.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>4-19 n</b></div><div><br/></div><div>still don&apos;t know the term for fear of good things happening being offset by future bad things, but if I have that, then today was horrifying. because some good things happened today. first there was the metope, where I met an energetic Kelli, an awkward [forgot his name], and a pretty Amanda. funny thing is that [forgot] is actually not only from NJ, but from Marlboro. the same town as me. with both him and I being somewhat awkward, we didn&apos;t exactly celebrate. felt the drain at first when amanda and kelli were talking to each other and [forgot] and I were sitting in silence. still too self-aware. aware of every motion I made. I tried to remind myself to be carefree, and it helped just a little bit. [forgot] and kelli talked with each other which left me with amanda, and I had to really usher away the anxiety to keep the conversation flowing. it ebbed a few times but never got too strained, I hope. I remember one thing she said about being lonely when she first moved down here. I should have asked about that. we all exchanged numbers at one point, and I gave mine to kelli and amanda. I didn&apos;t get amanda&apos;s though. I didn&apos;t want it. that leaves this temptation off the table. what about [forgot]? did anyone besides kelli get his number? I practically kept track of every time she accidentally bumped me with her foot. I&apos;d like to stop doing that but I can&apos;t help myself. wondering at every point if she wants to see me again at any point in the future for any reason. still don&apos;t see why anyone would. maybe if I let myself be a little sillier, it would help. when we talked about running and running with a partner, she said offhandedly to text her (even though I don&apos;t have her phone number) and now I keep thinking back to that and hoping she was sincere when she said it. that she&apos;ll actually follow up on my request for her to text me sometime during the week if she ever wanted to run with a partner. or she could just run by herself anyway. or with someone else. maybe what I&apos;d really like to know is simply what she thinks of me after today.</div><div><br/></div><div>I hope she texts me.</div><div><br/></div><div>I let kris know that I went to the metope but we didn&apos;t talk much. I joked about chuck. his texting and demeanor is intimidatingly standard.</div><div><br/></div><div>so Rachel finally got back to me today. through steam. she asked me what pronouns I use and I had to confirm what that meant. I think things turned out as I was almost-expecting. we went straight to skype and just started talking. like it was nothing. the way Zora did. there is no way this is exclusive to me, but I can dream (I shouldn&apos;t though). I played my flute for her too. then I went on my laptop and turned on my webcam too. this sort of thing is supposed to be a milestone, but it didn&apos;t feel like one. it wasn&apos;t difficult. but I revealed myself to someone and that&apos;s a big deal. for me. forget the texting disaster with abbey, this is far more interesting. while I still stumbled a lot, I&apos;m reasonably sure we can maintain contact...but there&apos;s no way for me to know what she thinks of me now, too. her voice was deeper than I was expecting. and again, she mentioned her boyfriend several times correctly assuming/presuming that I would know who she&apos;s referring to. just like lisa.</div><div><br/></div><div>there&apos;s no wondering about any sort of coincidence or fate here. just what&apos;s next, if anything, as a follow-up or not.</div><div><br/></div><div>earlier, at lucky buddha, I observed as the cashier tried to let a black guy know how annoyed he was after getting his order wrong over the phone. the black guy wasn&apos;t nice either, he looked in the brown bag and just went, &quot;...what did you do?&quot; what the fuck is that supposed to mean. and the cashier said twice that he clearly heard over the phone four shrimp fried rice. then when I stepped up to the counter, he cracked a joke. I ordered a fried rice too and he asked if I would like shrimp. just now I saw a post by Ritchie on Facebook, also concerning the lucky buddha cashier...</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m waking up. I want to go outside now. it took long enough, but things only get better from here, right? right?</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>4-20 m</b></div><div><br/></div><div>the inevitable crash, that I set myself up for every time. I tried messaging rachel again today. it didn&apos;t go badly, it just didn&apos;t go. funny how I had no expectations but was still disappointed. no, I did have expectations. I expected this. and was still disappointed. is there any reason to try to decipher her behavior?</div><div><br/></div><div>abbey replied to me today about dr. bombay&apos;s explicitly stating that we could go as friends. I kind of laughed a little bit, thinking wooow. but...I didn&apos;t feel so defeated. in truth it was rachel and amanda taking the heat. but I&apos;m still terrified. is she going to drag krish into this again? bail? bring another one of her friends? I can&apos;t see this happening, just the two of us sitting and talking at the place. drinking tea. I don&apos;t know what&apos;s going to happen. does the fact that she said yes mean anything at all? imagination will run despite everything. I&apos;ve learned to ignore it now.</div><div><br/></div><div>guess it was all just temporary. rachel, amanda, and abbey are all temporary.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>4-21 t</b></div><div><br/></div><div>last night I asked Poppybelle about the pseudo-date I have scheduled with Abbey, which I&apos;m still not 100% sure will take place as anticipated. she didn&apos;t really have anything to offer, but I felt more comfortable asking her about it then I did with Rachel.</div><div><br/></div><div>Zora and I skyped for two hours today, and I was able to video call this time. she told me about her boyfriend troubles. how she went on a motorcycle ride with a 30-year-old who she met online, and later slept with him at his house, and her mother doesn&apos;t know I don&apos;t think. and another guy who sold his classic mustang to make money so he could relocate and move closer to her, who moved on or around the day she broke up with him. she&apos;s come a long way since Seven. I didn&apos;t exactly have a lot of advice to offer her. I showed her my apartment too, played the butter building theme on my flute while she talked about her hair, then asked her about Abbey too. she said I should ask her out on a date if I really wanted to. I started playing L4D2 and she almost fell asleep. she hung up when she went to take a shower.</div><div><br/></div><div>coworker harry and I have been talking more since I started nofap. side effect of sociability?</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>4-22 w</b></div><div><br/></div><div>monique bailed on me today, and david followed. what a joke. maybe I wasn&apos;t expecting it, but it&apos;s still not surprising at all. shows how much of a priority it was to them. of course david wasn&apos;t going to come hang out with me alone, without monique there too. the attitude I have been perceiving from her has been a cold, negative one for some time. I&apos;m sure I wouldn&apos;t have liked it anyway. what&apos;s funny is that I actually put on hair gel and cologne right before I was getting ready to leave, and before I saw her cancellation text. I&apos;m all but certain that Abbey is going to do the same thing. the second-worst thing is that I&apos;ll find her with Krish or another friend of hers, or watch her walk in with one.</div><div><br/></div><div>since I was bailed on twice so far this week I literally just went on Meetup, looked at the calendar for anything else going on today and found one for the &quot;Atlanta Young Asians&quot; group at a hookah bar. it was set to 8 pm which gave me about forty minutes so I jumped on it. anything but staying in my room and inevitably playing L4D2. there, I was reminded again of why I didn&apos;t really like the asian group. there were too many people like me. like me, but better still. I never smoked that hookah back in Rome, making this my first experience and I didn&apos;t know how to at first, but I got the hang of it. I wasn&apos;t there for the people or the buzz. I just liked watching the smoke coming from my mouth.</div><div><br/></div><div>there was nothing bad about the people there, but I didn&apos;t didn&apos;t feel their vibe. it was Joanna&apos;s birthday and I forgot to say happy birthday to her twice. everyone there was older than me. three of them were 32 and one was almost 42. sadly I seem to look way older than I am. they placed me at 27.</div><div><br/></div><div>I felt at ease after they stopped poking fun at me for not knowing how to smoke, but little urge to talk to anybody. except the one girl who I thought was cute. I kept looking at the mole on her chin. at times everyone was engaged in conversation except for me. when one of them wasn&apos;t, I didn&apos;t feel like picking up. they were sitting too far away anyway. it should be clear at this point that the initial impression I make with people puts me in a difficult position. have I really progressed at all since last fall?</div><div><br/></div><div>some weird people showed up, an indian and a weird-looking korean (?) girl who apparently were a couple, and a black and another, highly dressed up korean girl, also a couple. the black/asian couple mostly kept to themselves and the indian guy remained very quiet, I didn&apos;t know he was part of his couple for most of the time. they were Joanna&apos;s friends and more of them kept coming. one was a photographer and kept taking photos. he took group photos of us and I kept making silly faces in them. I didn&apos;t ask him to send me the pictures, who knows how many I&apos;m in, before he left. I didn&apos;t want to call out.</div><div><br/></div><div>so for most of the night I just sat on the couch, unengaged. I don&apos;t know why I didn&apos;t feel sad about it at the end of the night. Joanna gave me a hug which I couldn&apos;t completely reciprocate because my hands were wet. that was the last thing I said to her, that my hands were wet. not happy birthday. but it&apos;s okay, for her. also thanked me for coming, and neither of us mentioned the possibility of any future meeting. at the check-out counter, one of the asian guys I had a brief talk with gave an unintentionally almost condescending vibe...all I could feel was the lack of any genuine interest, yet he kept asking me questions. when this happens, just keep talking. I have no interest in them either, anyway. see, now if/when this were to happen with Abbey, that would be a distressful problem.</div><div><br/></div><div>I must have not been smoking the hookah correctly all night because I never felt a thing. extremely slight lightheadedness when I got up to walk, which cleared up in seconds, and that was it. at least they tasted good. most of the people I saw there I&apos;d never have guessed were hookah smokers. this could give me something to talk about.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>4-23 r</b></div><div><br/></div><div>this is all about Abbey.</div><div><br/></div><div>so I met up with Abbey today and it went only as expected. I felt extremely awkward walking into Dr. Bombay&apos;s Underwater Tea Party alone (I got there first). tried to look at the bookshelves but nothing was interesting. I only looked an old book on computer hardware because I would know what it&apos;s talking about. of course it wasn&apos;t interesting at all. I ordered a blueberry green tea, the same thing I ordered the last time I was there. Abbey showed up not too late, in a nice looking dress, and got a cup of tea and a slice of pound cake. I didn&apos;t fulfill my sort of promise to buy her a cup of tea. and then we just sat and talked. even though nothing exciting was happening, at least it was going as promised. every time the conversation died, she started humming. she told me that Krish had taken her out to dinner on tuesday. I wished I had asked her more about that. was it a date? did she enjoy it? was it fun, was it awkward? if she doesn&apos;t go to the inman park festival on saturday that would leave me with no motivation to go at all. her shirt showed quite a bit of cleavage and I was struggling to not look at her breasts. I had kept fantasizing about having sex with her beforehand. even though I had only seen her four times before and couldn&apos;t really remember what her face looks like (the same applies to Rachel and Zora. the face recollection, not the sex.). I should pursue this relentless as far as I can go. will the outcome be worth the effort in the end, no matter how it turns out?</div><div><br/></div><div>maybe that&apos;s why she took so long to answer my initial invitation. because Krish had offered one too. is she getting any more male attention and is she accustomed to it?</div><div><br/></div><div>I can feel myself attempting to twist every single action of hers into a favorable signal. this cannot be trusted and is to be ignored. I tried asking Zora about what I should do but she doesn&apos;t seem very interested in helping me out at all.</div><div><br/></div><div>my biggest worry is that I came across as too shy and awkward, too uptight, not enjoyable to be around. why did Krish say I seemed cool? people used to say I&apos;m funny. I know I couldn&apos;t get myself to loosen up entirely in Abbey&apos;s presence. imagine if she knows she could do that to a person.</div><div><br/></div><div>I think if she really enjoyed my company she wouldn&apos;t have left after just under an hour. and there wouldn&apos;t have been as many lulls in the conversation. I don&apos;t like the idea of being flirtatious, but maybe I should try it. as she was leaving, I said to her, &quot;thanks for coming.&quot; on the way back, I played and sang along to Lights in the car.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>4-25 s</b></div><div><br/></div><div>I was going to go to Angie&apos;s trivia meetup, until krish texted me and invited me to join him and his friend. I tried to go to Angie&apos;s first, but just wasted a drive to the tavern. it wasn&apos;t really a fulfilling night, but the time spent was still valuable because it allowed me to gain perspective (intel, and insight). I still talk too quietly, though, and I still didn&apos;t feel fully myself around krish and his friend who I met today, Saavy.</div><div><br/></div><div>after coming right back from the tavern, i spent $28 on a bottle of Kraken and a bottle of coke. picked up krish, who was getting hookah supplies. we met with Saavy at his apartment building&apos;s parking garage, only to drive right back to my own and Uber back again over there. I didn&apos;t feel very uneasy because I had no investment in this meeting. but I&apos;m sure it was way obvious that I was a stranger. and I don&apos;t know what they thought of that. there was no perceived threat to keep me on an edge, so I lapsed. I thought all the worst thoughts. that they&apos;d try to throw me over the balcony. krish winning Abbey over. that they&apos;re toying with me. he told me about a date with her they have planned. this and other things he shared indicates that he isn&apos;t trying to taunt me with anything. if he says that he thinks I&apos;m cool, invited me to hang out with him, and shared Abbey detailed with me, then I might actually be just a friend to him. and always the question: why? they texted, &quot;how&apos;s your weekend?&quot; he detailed to me how he asked her out via text. the reason I didn&apos;t do the same thing? I didn&apos;t want to seem...like a tool. I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s the right word. I don&apos;t want it made clear that she is my goal. I don&apos;t want her to smell my beeline towards her. but apparently there is no way around this. it&apos;s either that, or remain complacent, whither, and die again. I don&apos;t know if trial #1 can proceed anymore. I will utilize tomorrow to find out.</div><div><br/></div><div>you can envision the positive outcomes, you can envision the negative outcomes. both are equally optimistic/pessimistic in magnitude.</div><div><br/></div><div>I shouldn&apos;t have made myself have to wait until tomorrow. I realize now that I should have just texted her the day of. it would have been obvious, again, but also more conclusive. and that&apos;s more valuable, desirable, and...useful.</div><div><br/></div><div>the actual hangout with krish and Saavy was actually quite boring, though my ears did perk up at specific conversation topics. like sex. I&apos;ll remember and forget the details, I was half-hoping that I&apos;d get the opportunity to tell them that I&apos;m a virgin. and why? I wonder if they could tell, somehow. the porn sites they liked most. Saavy described porn as &quot;beautiful&quot; because it teaches people a lot about how sex works.</div><div><br/></div><div>krish telling me about his upcoming date with Abbey certainly wasn&apos;t as crushing as it would have been in the past. I still felt (crushed) disheartened, totally, discouraged, you name it. I need this desire to go on. I let depression and anxiety swallow everything in the past, before. now I just believe that there is hope in unapologetically being myself. how often does that work? now I can believe that there is someone out there who will like me.</div><div><br/></div><div>as always, for now.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>4-28 t</b></div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday at sweetwater may have been a bit of a letdown. I met a Patrick, who I&apos;ve seen on the meetup pages but don&apos;t recall having met in person, but he said I look familiar. so did another guy whose name I forgot. Abbey had changed her RSVP and wasn&apos;t there. the Patrick was also chinese and could speak mandarin, and he seemed decently charismatic. he was dressed a lot more sharply than I was and was likely more confident. I was less as a result. the Stephanie that I met there paid a lot more attention to him than me. all I said to her was a question about her jewelry. I kept asking the Patrick random questions, noticing how I wanted to talk to him for some reason. his no-nonsense answers were hammering me. Krish ended up coming with a friend who recognized me, who I know I&apos;ve seen before somewhere but can&apos;t remember where. met but didn&apos;t talk to an asian girl whose name I forgot until Krish reminded me it was Melody (assuming that spelling). I wanted to say something to her but she could probably tell I was tipsy; the Patrick talked to her first; and she left quickly before I could muster up the power. Krish actually encouraged me to chase her into the parking lot, but I said I wasn&apos;t quite at that point yet. since Abbey wasn&apos;t present, I asked her out over text instead. she said no. it was completely expected but unavoidably disappointing; it was also anticlimactic and nothing. this is literally the first instance of me every asking a girl out and it was nothing. I wonder if losing my virginity will feel like this too, depending on when it happens (assuming if) and who it might be with.</div><div><br/></div><div>today I went to the carapace event that Krish loves so much and I found out why. reminiscent of the weird toastmasters meeting I attended that one time, only much more lively and fitting for me. as much as this terrifies me, I know this is something I&apos;ll have to do at some point. here is God, again. everything happens for a reason. I talked a little bit with the Ted, and was pleasantly surprised at my ability to talk. I said a tiny something to a woman (and presumably her husband) that Ted was talking with too. she smiled at me and said I have the same name as her son. I said something back. before, I would have only smiled. I drove Krish home again and I&apos;m almost ready to believe that he genuinely enjoys my company. stop asking questions. now we&apos;re going to go to yoga.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>4-30 r</b></div><div><br/></div><div>is it possible to become an extrovert? perhaps I&apos;ve been alone for so long that it&apos;s happening to me. I need energy from other people now. I felt happy at the trivia meetup today, something that needs fuel to sustain its momentum, that will run out if I don&apos;t feed it. I don&apos;t want to sink. not again. not after all those months from last fall to winter. a Sophie was present today and she seemed really shy. her eyes were shadowy and it made her face seem kind of gaunt even though she wasn&apos;t overly skinny or bony. she didn&apos;t talk a lot, just a little bit to angie and the guy sitting next to her. I made up my mind, I didn&apos;t talk to her for very long but I did start a few lines. the smallest of baby steps. means my next will have to be bigger. I asked her about her nostril piercing. in an unlikely twist, she was too quiet for most of the conversation and I couldn&apos;t hear HER. although I still had to repeat myself a couple times too. she said she had to meet with another friend so she excused herself and left, shaking hands with me before she went. not sure what that meant. I had never introduced myself to her or told her my name.</div><div><br/></div></div></en-note>      ]]>

I was dressed in my usual sloppy North Face gray hoodie, holding the ASUS VG248QE monitor that I'd just sold last night to Tstrait21. she said something about not being able to go up unless she's sprinting, then wished me a good day.

<en-note><div><b>4-12 t</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Bina has called me talkative.</div><div><br/></div><div>the other day christian started telling me about regretting never having gone to college. I sensed he was holding back. that would have been around ten years ago for him. the memories must have compressed like layers of rock in that time. I know mine are. they&apos;re becoming more difficult to dig up.</div><div><br/></div><div>Zora joined a L4D2 game with me and DOOGIE yesterday. I don&apos;t know when I last played with her before then. there were twinges of jealousy whenever he talked to her...I know we had all played together before, but he said something about not having heard her voice in a while, and that seemed to me like something that you&apos;d only say to someone if you knew her for longer than he did. I tried to not seem like I cared too much. I tried not to care.</div><div><br/></div><div>after being increasingly annoyed in-game for over two hours and debating with DOOGIE over nuances, Zora interrupted and said we were arguing like a married couple. she was right. I always sense a tension on my end when I&apos;m playing with him, and that&apos;s not healthy. for me. I&apos;m constantly looking for evidence that I&apos;m better than him, that I&apos;m above him. I had asked to see what his apartment looks like so I could compare it to mine. in my mind I compare our ages, our jobs. I think about all the time he spends watching computer hardware youtube channels and how he sometimes goes on longer gaming sessions than I do. all the while somehow convincing myself that I&apos;m doing better when I&apos;m actually doing the same.</div><div><br/></div><div>and my already sour mood was worsened by spending at least an hour watching car accident and road rage videos. which Carried Over to this morning, returning shortly after I woke up. my annoyance flared a bit at the mcdonald&apos;s drive-thru, where I actually bumped into the woman&apos;s car in front of me. this, happening to me, because of me. she was annoyed of course, as anyone would be, but the situation didn&apos;t escalate, and after she saw nothing was wrong with her bumper she seemed to forget about me and drove off. pretty sure the employees taking drive-thru orders heard.</div><div><br/></div><div>I hope I&apos;m not running to absurd lengths with this, but I swear that christian&apos;s tendency to criticize other drivers is rubbing off on me (as has been since mark and Amber were with us as well). I used to be far more patient. now his thoughts have become my own.</div><div><br/></div><div>the Harry is leaving this workplace after this week. how different will it feel? I&apos;m going to find out.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>4-13 w</b></div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday christian told me that he wouldn&apos;t be able to go to the gym on friday because he has a doctor&apos;s appointment. it&apos;s the first time he informs me of an absence. the second is today, when he walked over to tell me he had a luncheon to go to.</div><div><br/></div><div>I tell DOOGIE that I bought new underwear in &quot;pretty colors&quot; and that no one will ever see it. he references a future girlfriend.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>4-20 w</b></div><div><br/></div><div>i have just bought a pair of &quot;docksider&quot; pants from the gap. they are blue and look different from the khakis i had recently gotten irl. they are softer. the size is 32x32 but too large for me. the website shows two other colors, red and green, all in even larger sizes. i find myself at a gap store looking in every section to see if they have more of these pants. then i realize that something must be going on because one area is crowded with girls, almost all of them at least topless, if not naked. i walk among them, still looking for the pants, trying not to look at their breasts. i later read online that they have &quot;officially&quot; stopped making them.</div><div><br/></div><div>the section of 16th st leading to my apartment building is lined with shelves down the middle, filled top to bottom with romanesco broccoli. kyle from work is sitting on a railing and just chilling.</div><div><br/></div><div>i&apos;m in my car with a car in front and another behind me. we are on a winding path and drops off on either side into a foggy void. the person in front of me is driving on two wheels, with the car tilted completely to 90 degrees. he stops and gets out of his car, a big hulking black guy, becoming angry for no apparent reason. i get out of my car and head to the one stopped behind me. inside is a black woman. I think i tell her to call 911, while i do the same. the big guy is walking over to me slowly. i calmly explain over the phone the situation and how i&apos;m genuinely fearing for my life, while at the same staying on the path and trying to kick him. my legs are too heavy.</div><div><br/></div><div>at the office last week Bina and Marty handed me a card to sign. it seemed to be some kind of appreciation card, for Keisha. inside, around the edges, were short messages from all coworkers, all saying the same thing, a basic thank you. I have never seen a card that felt more insincere to me.</div><div><br/></div><div>it looks like Krish and Abbey are still together. they would have celebrated their anniversary recently, I imagine.</div><div><br/></div><div>Harry&apos;s last day at the office was last friday, and his desk not yet empty and his fridge still here (he never came back yesterday to reclaim as he said he would). I wonder if I&apos;ll ever see him again. as it was with Mark, I guess I just witnessed the end of something.</div><div><br/></div><div>his &quot;going away lunch&quot; was last thursday after which everyone was complaining about the service at the place we went to, and I ended up going out to lunch again with him, Bina, Dave, and Matt, randomly. at the elevator I ran in christian, who had a mcdonald&apos;s bag. how he barely acknowledged me made Bina laugh. I wonder if he was embarrassed about the mcdonald&apos;s. or if I only think that because I would be. at lunch Bina (most likely) commented on how quiet Matt is. it&apos;s the first time in years I&apos;ve heard that said about someone else. he is really quiet. I hadn&apos;t thought much about it.</div><div><br/></div><div>later christian and I ran into each other in the hallway later and we ended up having a &quot;conversation.&quot; I kind of just wanted to leave the whole time he was telling me about his doctor&apos;s appointment.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div>4-1 n</div><div><br/></div><div>I can&apos;t sleep. a clean quarter of the year has now passed. today I finished replaying episode 3 of life is strange, which got me thinking back to 2015 again. I talked a little to ROdNEY about depression. my depression. hearing it come from him is affirming. he said that he sees no reason for me to depressed, a concern which I share, and that I should appreciate all I have that many do not. and that I may not have in the future. health, money, youth. all things that can rapidly deplete.</div><div><br/></div><div>the intensity of my nostalgia for 2015 (and more and more dimly, 2014) contrasts a bit with the more recent months of late 2016 and earlier this year. the images are lower res and overall vaguer. once again, this is because there is so much less to remember. habit changes are slow and new experiences to associate with the music are extremely few and far between.</div><div><br/></div><div>I found out last friday that I didn&apos;t make it to grad school at tech. realizing how little substance there is in my current existence, combined with glimpses of cityofrachels and alice&apos;s social media, is depressing. the greyness, the bleakness of everything is...I see very little point in life now and it&apos;s making me worry that I&apos;ll become suicidal at some point in the future, even though I&apos;ve never been so before.</div><div><br/></div><div>&lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE hasn&apos;t been inviting me to L4D2 games recently. this is good. in recent weeks all I fantasize about are long sessions of gameplay with him and our now mutual friends. saturday morning, clean underwear, a cool t-shirt. I need to develop new visions. I&apos;ve exhausted so much mental energy on pointlessly heavy, and maladaptive, fantasies, putting it through such unnecessary strain considering hypothetical scenarios that are not worth constructing and maintaining. every day I&apos;ve been coming home and have nothing to look forward to but toys. maybe now I&apos;m finally getting tired of it all and am once more considering abandoning objects and dream worlds, if for no other reason than that I am last just becoming bored of it.</div><div><br/></div><div>there have been many one- and two-year anniversaries that I&apos;ve neglected. I can&apos;t keep track of it all.</div><div><br/></div><div>some new phase is sinking in again. my moods are regressing...to patterns I recognize from before. in the meetings at work I never want to laugh when everyone else is at some joke or funny comment. the thought of conversing with Marty or bina makes me sick. and I never say anything to Jessica. I wish I didn&apos;t have to have anything to do with any of the people there. I don&apos;t want anyone but I don&apos;t want to be alone. I can&apos;t there is no way out.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>4-4 t</div><div><br/></div><div>so Christian continues to be a reflection of my own hypocrisy, as I think about all the things he&apos;s said he wanted to do but never followed through with. I have no right to this vain pride for as long as I remain the same.</div><div><br/></div><div>I should stop worrying about whether &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE (and bina) are virgins and begin working on losing my own if it really means this much to me.</div><div><br/></div><div>bina returned from her trip to iceland today. that&apos;s it. that&apos;s the story. I&apos;m me, so whatever grand adventures she&apos;s just been through didn&apos;t happen. Marty asked if she had fun. nobody is special. no one.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>4-5 w</div><div><br/></div><div>I always initially keep track of the days and weeks since the last break. since the year began. since I hung out with x. since mom visited. at some point, I let it go without noticing.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>4-6 r</div><div><br/></div><div>I don&apos;t know what it was yesterday but I had some kind of mini or micro anxiety attack yesterday while thinking about my defects. I almost started crying for a second. felt like I had to go home. and I did, I left the office for a couple hours and afterwards couldn&apos;t recall what I had just felt. by late afternoon I felt normally numb again, and I noticed the contrast. it&apos;s happened before, though, and likely will again. it&apos;s just I can never recall unless I try hard enough.</div><div><br/></div><div>I can&apos;t see myself as an old person, and I&apos;ve no idea how normal that is. I used to think that having music invoke memories and emotions was somehow unique, but I&apos;m sure it isn&apos;t. this may just be another new thing that I&apos;ll eventually realize everyone goes through, but right now I&apos;m almost convinced that one way or another I&apos;ll never live long enough to become &quot;old.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>thing I remember from last year: around this time (april) is when I began hoarding all the printed invoices that come with my online orders.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>4-16 n</div><div><br/></div><div>my bedtime has been disrupted and I rolled out of bed to unpack some thoughts</div><div><br/></div><div>about how I seem to have reached some kind of material breaking point. little bits here and there are able to temporarily align my mindset such that I&apos;m able to see clearly how nothing lasts forever. I know I&apos;ll end up reverting, I wish I could figure out how to return to this setting at will. so much of my energy is spent on real and imaginary objects now, that I can&apos;t take it anymore and something needs to happen.</div><div><br/></div><div>another sad thing is that I know I&apos;ll forget it again when I wake up in the morning.</div><div><br/></div><div>I look forward to these weekends but I also hate them. the maintenance I need is now insane. as is the excess I&apos;ve accumulated. there is never anything different, anything to look forward to. just think about what I&apos;m going to remember about this time.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>4-17 m</div><div><br/></div><div>ten days ago was when I went to the Cumberland Mall to pick up a pair of shoes at a finish line there that I really wanted and simply had to have, and I didn&apos;t realize until I had left the parking lot that it was the same mall that I&apos;d eaten with steph and sam and a bunch of others for some birthday dinner a few years ago. I&apos;m also pretty sure my route to a few meetups with the Angie some time back also passed through the area. I didn&apos;t recognize it at first.</div><div><br/></div><div>two aprils ago was when</div><div><br/></div><div>was when I was friends with Krish and was interested in Abbey. I was trying to stop masturbating and was making small changes that I thought were actually helping me get out there and become a normal person. I can&apos;t believe it was so long ago. there&apos;s been so little between that collapse and now.</div><div><br/></div><div>every time I christian buys me lunch because I forgot my wallet or something, he forgets that I owe him the next time. a couple weeks ago I bought one for him and of course he totally forgot that he owes me. I&apos;m letting that one go though.</div><div><br/></div><div>he has brought up the topic of how seamlessly people and vehicles navigate busy street intersections in crowded asian countries, at least three times now. apparently forgetting that we&apos;ve had this exact conversation before.</div><div><br/></div><div>last week a black guy at sarpino&apos;s (must have been an employee there) who beckoned at me and asked me where I got the pants I was wearing (they were everlane slim pants). then asked me what I study, just assuming I&apos;m a student, and for some reason I replied that I graduated from tech a few years ago instead of just saying that I go there. then asked me how I&apos;d figure out a simple substring task in java that he showed me. he must have been learning to code on his own. we were interrupted when someone called him behind the counter, and again when my calzone was ready. it was an easy solution and he was probably only struggling with it because it was all new to him. I could have helped him more.</div><div><br/></div><div>lisa commented on one of my instagram posts. it&apos;s the first correspondence of any kind we&apos;ve had in nearly three years. see how these things are still noteworthy to me?</div><div><br/></div><div>I think bina only asks me to see movies with her because she doesn&apos;t want to go watch one in the theatre alone. and maybe she had asked others already but they all said they couldn&apos;t go. she&apos;s on her phone a lot. asks me questions and then doesn&apos;t appear to acknowledge my answers. we hardly discuss the movie at all when it&apos;s over, and she leaves immediately.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>4-23 n</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s only been four days since receiving the uncomfortable news that could lead to the destabilization of the routine and complacency I&apos;ve been residing in for months, years. I&apos;m assuming the worst and maybe there&apos;s still some ongoing numbness that&apos;s keeping me from experiencing the full anticipation and anxiety. I sure won&apos;t be missed when I&apos;m gone. I already want nothing to do with them all. I wish I didn&apos;t need other people.</div><div><br/></div><div>the workplace has gone through many iterations since I started there almost three years ago, and I never noticed when a new one began and an old one ended, until I turn around and look back. I have a small, vague feeling that everything I know now is going to change. every little thing that has been part of my daily for months at a time. the details from previous iterations are already gone, so it&apos;s the current ones that I get to say good-bye to now. the meetings every other day with the same people, who appeared almost as they would in a dream. when did they even get here? the office arrangement and room I&apos;ve been in since last july. and the people...</div><div><br/></div><div>actually the last three years have all been like a long dream, like galaxies are to star systems. I can only recall the same blurry scenes and phases. just like how an atom is mostly empty space, when this era is over most of it will be forgotten. there isn&apos;t that much to remember.</div><div><br/></div><div>I had a dream once with the Travis and the Jessica from work, and the latter is the subject of my latest dark fantasy.</div><div><br/></div><div>now I&apos;m working with the Matt on a smaller project that I&apos;m probably still actually not important enough for, and it&apos;s not going to last long. it&apos;s only a matter of time until things start really rolling downhill, and mere anticipation does nothing but allow me to say, I told you so. Matt does that awkward-friendly fake laugh a lot.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>4-24 m</div><div><br/></div><div>today is monday, an odd-numbered day, it&apos;s 9:43 am and I officially no longer have to somewhat-dread the meeting at 11 that I&apos;ve had to wait for every other day for the past couple months, as I&apos;m not on the team anymore. it&apos;s almost, almost refreshing. I&apos;m sure the rest will go too, everything has to evaporate sometime.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<!DOCTYPE en-note SYSTEM "http://xml.evernote.com/pub/enml2.dtd">

<en-note><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">4-3 t</span></div><div><br/></div><div>there&apos;s too much brain noise and I can&apos;t silence it.</div><div><br/></div><div>I can feel me dipping down again this week. the next wave hit during the bjj class. I always tell myself to greet Hannah with her name, which she does for me, but I still haven&apos;t. she&apos;s always too far away, I say. what kind of vibe am I giving her? I sat off to the side by myself instead of next to her. Jacob wasn&apos;t here this time so we had a substitute, someone named Patrick. he seemed to be partially stuck in the past? kept mentioning the wrestling he did in high school, how he was 40 lbs lighter, etc. who am I to judge. I rolled with Hannah again and the only guard I had was around my ego. low confidence and having no idea of what to anticipate. note that I also never go on the offensive, I just stay where I am until she does something else and then react to it.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;ve had tinder installed on my phone for several weeks now, and I&apos;m just trying to forget that it&apos;s not going to be this savior that it is in my mind.</div><div><br/></div><div>somehow I had forgotten that I already reread my early journal entries at around this time of year last year. I&apos;ve been rereading pieces of them again, and I realize I had also forgotten how long ago I began describing feeling depressed or wondering if I was. that puts it at at least six years.</div><div><br/></div><div>not sure if it&apos;s because I&apos;m reaching some kind of breaking point, but I&apos;ve been finally opening up to my mom about the anxiety I&apos;m feeling, though only through text. and also beginning to seriously consider therapy. out of desperation, anything to feel better. today I called her after she asked me to, and listened to her for about half an hour before I hung up.</div><div><br/></div><div>I realize that the fetishes I&apos;ve been looking at are yet another manifestation of feeling unwanted and not&nbsp;&nbsp;being good enough.</div><div><br/></div><div>season 2 of &apos;a series of unfortunate events&apos; was released on netflix last friday, and despite looking forward to it all month, I ended up completely forgetting about last week, only remembering yesterday.</div><div><br/></div><div>there are less than three months left before I hit the 4-year mark. approaching the end of the second year since moving into the terraces, I can see how time just becomes more forgettable. the second two years make up 50% of the time vs 100% of the first two. this is the shower water slowly becoming cold. like holding onto a weight that&apos;s getting heavier.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">4-4 w</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>when I&apos;m feeling &quot;okay&quot; it&apos;s not because I&apos;m actually getting better, it&apos;s because I&apos;ve just managed to forget for the time being.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>I surprise myself sometimes with how well I can function. talking with Hannah was simple and easy. for some reason I was getting a bit of an adrenaline rush on the way to the boxing gym, even though I&apos;m fairly comfortable there now, but when I got there I felt fine. there was another new person there, a bigger guy named Scott, and I was stuck with him for the class. while we were rolling around, I let myself channel some anger or whatever, and Jacob noticed the uptick in aggression.</div><div><br/></div><div>I learned that Hannah met her John on tinder. and also that he took her motorcycle and registered it under his own name, effectively making him the owner even though she spent her money on it. that made Jacob angry. she seems to be sharing a lot about her relationship with him. I don&apos;t want to write too much about this person I don&apos;t know, but Hannah does seem to recognize that some of his behavior is somewhat bizarre. maybe it&apos;s not all sunshine and rainbows. I think I said this before.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">4-5 r</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>I rolled with a couple different people and kept getting beaten. I&apos;m not as strong as I thought. it&apos;s important to keep the attitude where I&apos;m excited to keep going and try again. Jacob said again that he&apos;s surprised with me, &quot;in a good way&quot; he added. I overheard Hannah talking with Mallory about her John again and his taking her motorcycle. Mallory emphasized what should be obvious based on what I&apos;ve heard so far. Hannah said she knows. I wonder how much it&apos;s stressing her out. as we left the mats, Mallory called out to her, &quot;he literally stole it,&quot; and I knew what she meant. Hannah seemed slightly down when I said I wouldn&apos;t be here on saturday and said bye. preoccupied.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">4-6 f</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday I went to eats with the company for the first time. Anthony sat with his friend and the rest of us sat at one of the round tables, with Zach not realizing that Aaron had already claimed a seat there. so Aaron ended up sitting at another table by himself, and no one really paid attention to him. I wanted to go over and sit next to him, but didn&apos;t.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m taking a somewhat impromptu trip home for the weekend, which I let my parents plan for me after talking with my mother earlier this week.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">4-10 t</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m getting tired of my so-called simple fantasies and maintaining them.</div><div><br/></div><div>petunia asked me once more where I live. apparently she didn&apos;t believe that I&apos;m in atlanta because I mentioned taking a subway, until I mentioned that it was MARTA. then she told me where she lived and where she worked. I wonder if I&apos;ll ever end up meeting her. maybe I could go to the marshall&apos;s she said she works at and get a glimpse of her. I&apos;m sure she looks nothing like how I try to envision her. her name is Lane.</div><div><br/></div><div>I don&apos;t have much to say about the weekend I spent at home. spent saturday binging a series of unfortunate events, casting it to the tv as usual, along with some far cry 5. my brother left to go back to school the next morning, and both of my parents dropped me off at the airport. my toe had been swollen and sensitive and I could barely walk. nita always tells me to notify her when I&apos;m traveling someplace, but I didn&apos;t say anything until yesterday. I mentioned watching a series of unfortunate events, and she asked me a couple questions that didn&apos;t make sense.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>with some uncertainty I&apos;m giving myself a break with the jiu-jitsu classes for the week.</div><div><br/></div><div>I ended up creating a tinder profile this morning, though I&apos;ve set it to not show. I keep telling myself it&apos;s until I magically learn to take pictures of myself. I mentioned it to Zach, and he said he doesn&apos;t really pay attention to it anymore and that he hasn&apos;t gone out with anyone this year. he also brought up the jimmy john&apos;s sandwich that I forgot I owed him. apparently he&apos;s low on money.</div><div><br/></div><div>Z. (Zora) messaged me on steam today.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">4-11 w</span></div><div><br/></div><div>petunia and I were talking again yesterday. this time I learned that she&apos;s not black but caucasian, and I also told her of my ethnicity as well.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">4-12 r</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>I halfheartedly asked Amanda if she wanted to hang out, but I don&apos;t think she wants to. she just doesn&apos;t answer and I don&apos;t really care.</div><div><br/></div><div>Hannah messaged me today, asking how I&apos;ve been. I figured it was to check up on me, and I was right. it was kind of touching. her John asked her to take his car to the shop so she&apos;s been stressed out about a car that isn&apos;t hers. I caught my mind as it began running again.</div><div><br/></div><div>I want to become comfortable with seeing myself in a camera. I need to learn to take pictures of myself, maybe in different outfits, to show people and also to document the shifts.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">4-15 n</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>each day passes the same way as the one before it. I have not been making any changes.</div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday:</div><div><br/></div><div>I skipped the morning run again after finding that my toe still hurt. I had run a short distance to the park before the rest of group got there, and passed them while I was walking back. Jay was among the group. I waved awkwardly at them, barely raising my hand, and said a &quot;hey&quot; to him that he definitely didn&apos;t hear. Cody actually texted me later in the evening. I told him about my toe, and he asked me what I was doing. why does he bother?</div><div><br/></div><div>Hannah wasn&apos;t at the bjj class even though she had said see you tomorrow. so it was just me, Jacob, and the Mallory, and the Jose showed up halfway through. Jacob asked me where I&apos;d been, and I responded, &quot;taking a break from everything,&quot; as planned. Mallory and I were quiet as we practiced another move that I&apos;ll probably forget about. she and Jacob kept talking amongst themselves. I rolled with them and kept getting destroyed. I popped my elbow rather loudly when Mallory had me in an arm lock, and she immediately let go, asking if I was okay with an extremely concerned look on her face. I paused for several seconds before simply saying, &quot;I think so.&quot; there were several other guys there watching. I just realized that I wasn&apos;t concerned at the time about them watching me. the only thing I was disappointed about was not coming up with a more humorous response in the moment. I did the abdominal routine on my own, away from the rest of them, and Jacob took a moment to commend me for it. elbow is still a little sore.</div><div><br/></div><div>earlier that morning, nita messaged me on facebook and then called me on my phone, asking if she come over and hang out for bit because she wanted &quot;a change of scenery.&quot; not sure what was up with that, but I said sure. I met up with her at food terminal (!) some time after my class ended. I think this is the third time I saw her this year so far. felt slightly more at ease talking to her. she told me that my arms looked bigger than they did last time, especially my forearms, and asked me if I could tell that she lost weight. instead of telling her she looked smaller, I said, &quot;I think so.&quot; the food I ordered was a little better than what I got the last time I was there with the Amanda. nita kept asking me if I wanted to try her food, and she wanted to try some of mine, too. we went to an ice cream place afterwards, which had a bit of a novelty thing where you could watch them scrape the ice cream bits into rolls. nita was way more excited about it than I was, and kept eating bits of mine.</div><div><br/></div><div>she followed me on buford highway back to my apartment, where I allowed her to sit on the couch and work on a slideshow for a wedding she was going to next week. she said she needed to make 30 minutes of video and had asked for hundreds of pictures for it. I did a few chores, thinking about the two times I&apos;d gone over to Hannah&apos;s place while she did her own chores. eventually nita began to bug me to put on one punch man, and I relented, sitting on the (uncomfortable) couch next to her to watch. it was a funnier show than I expected, and I liked it. she kept giving me an i-told-you-so, because she had told me a couple months to watch it and I never had, and wouldn&apos;t stop asking me if I liked it, even though I always answered that I did like it. we went through half the season. then she packed up her things and I walked her to the garage, where we hugged before she left.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">4-16 m</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>I fondly recall 2017 while 2016, 2015, 2014, and earlier steadily drop from my memory.</div><div>this morning I just waited at home for my shoes to get delivered instead of going to work at my usual time.</div><div>~</div><div>at the bjj class today, the Scott was there again. he seems nice, but he&apos;s really sweaty. I rolled with him and quickly grew tired, probably because he&apos;s so much heavier than me. then I went with Mallory, who gave me some more suggestions this time, and said good job at the end. and also Hannah, who was easiest because she was tired and the weighed the least. afterwards I chatted with her a little bit about stuff. her John is coming back from his vacation tomorrow and she&apos;s excited, taking the time to ride the train to the airport tomorrow to see him even though it isn&apos;t necessary. she gave me a hug before I left.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">4-17 t</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>I decided to casually mention to christian that I&apos;d started BJJ, and he mentioned that he had been in a bad car accident a week and a half ago that put him in the hospital, caused $15,000 of damage to his car, and hurt his back, neck, and legs. I didn&apos;t know what to say.</div><div><br/></div><div>among the things I chatted about with Hannah yesterday was the fact that the body starts declining at around our age, and maybe we&apos;re beginning to feel the effects. I felt a lot worse this morning trying to do my chest workout than I did last week, and just gave up after a single exercise.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>it was just me and Mallory again in class today. she gave me a small smile as we shook hands at the end.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">4-20 f</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>nita has a sort of childlike quality about her, which manifested in a couple ways when we hung out last week. first when we were driving separately and she rolled down her window to call out to me, and later looking at me as I passed her. then when we were watching one punch man together, she kept getting excited at the funny parts that she knew were coming. I don&apos;t see that a lot anymore.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m frequently delay writing because I&apos;m afraid I won&apos;t be able to smoothly and adequately transcribe the thoughts I&apos;ve been wanting to record.</div><div><br/></div><div>in some ways I miss the cozy-feeling shared office I had at tech. I daydream about coming in earlier than everyone, before the sun rises, with a guilty-pleasure mcdonald&apos;s iced coffee, sipping on it as I browse shit in the dark. I&apos;ve become very hedonistic and it&apos;s dominated my fantasies for months, if not for over a year now. the Gorm has been &quot;on holiday&quot; this week, and I think he&apos;s going to be away for the next two weeks as well. that&apos;s more than enough time to become very comfortable with not doing any work, and despite spending entire days accomplishing absolutely nothing, I still feel tired when I leave for home. I have no ill feelings towards Hannah, but I&apos;m feeding on her negative qualities here. we tend to banter a bit as we&apos;re rolling on the mats, and she&apos;s light and doesn&apos;t smell as bad as the others.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;ve had next to no contact with Cody during these past few weeks. I wonder if the same thing will happen between us as what happened with Krish, almost three years ago. I guess neither of us can do anything for the other.</div><div><br/></div><div>some days ago Dorothy commented on a photo I put on facebook, telling me I should &quot;come out&quot; with them &quot;next time&quot; because she wants to &quot;hear about my experience with something.&quot; I don&apos;t know what that means.</div><div><br/></div><div>as I&apos;m rereading my past journal entries by the day, I&apos;m noticing a lot of depressive symptom descriptions. emotional numbness, inability to feel. something else I&apos;ve been picking up on about my past self is how I didn&apos;t allow myself to feel good about anything. it&apos;s like whenever I felt anything positive, I&apos;d remind myself that it wasn&apos;t there to stay, and wouldn&apos;t let myself enjoy it for too long. always cautious and on guard, towards *good* feelings. and then the already-known sense of entitlement towards others&apos; friendships, and ensuing bitterness. every interaction meant so much to me, it was quite sad.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">4-22 n</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>saturday:</div><div><br/></div><div>a random guy began making small talk with me as I made my way to the park alone. I ran my usual 5 miles, pushing through despite not having run the last two saturdays. I waved to the Jay both times I briefly ran past him. when I got to jason&apos;s deli there was no one there. but a minute later I ran into the guy with the big nose (apparently his name is Tom) and then Cody shortly after, and we sat outside. two other staple members of the running group, that Wendy and Elizabeth, were there too. I didn&apos;t feel like joining the conversation because they weren&apos;t talking about anything interesting, and left them after saying bye. Cody just said a &quot;see ya&quot; and I perceived it negatively.</div><div><br/></div><div>I ask mike again about meeting up for lunch, but he had another excuse. this was my last attempt.</div><div><br/></div><div>the day&apos;s jiu-jitsu class was normal but the Mallory and Jose were doing their conditioning again, and Hannah and I stuck around afterwards while they took an extra two hours before we were all ready to go out to lunch somewhere. Hannah&apos;s the one always asking if anyone wants to go eat, but she almost always plans on not actually ordering any food for herself. she also keeps inviting us over to her place or her building&apos;s pool.</div><div><br/></div><div>they all love the place ssam burger, and Mallory seems to be the type to aggressively voice her distaste for things she doesn&apos;t like. she shot down my suggestion for flip burger and the only thing I felt bad about was not having any response when asked, &quot;what&apos;s wrong with you?&quot; I don&apos;t like ssam burger very much at all; it could be that &quot;elite taste&quot; of mine that nita had brought up last december. Jacob and Hannah kept talking about motorcycles; apparently she&apos;s planning on buying another one. I don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on with her John&apos;s registering her first one, but she didn&apos;t seem to want to talk about it. Jose and Mallory were talking about idk. I remember Jacob mentioning that he doesn&apos;t eat enough, so he isn&apos;t perfect either. Mallory hugged the others as we left, I noticed that. she said, I think, &quot;bye dan&quot; to me? and I responded with only &quot;bye&quot; and was surprised when she gave me a hug too. then she said something about putting her arm in the wrong place because I&apos;m taller than her, so I said said something like, &quot;let&apos;s try it again&quot; and we did. this sounds like something I could have written six years ago. Hannah said, &quot;see you dan&quot; as she got into Mallory&apos;s car next to me, and I replied only &quot;see you.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>she later messaged me asking if I wanted to play don&apos;t starve! together, following up on an earlier conversation. not sure what she was expecting but I wasn&apos;t ready to buy the $15 game that I have never played before. I later asked for her steam name, and it showed that she hadn&apos;t been online in 17 days.</div><div><br/></div><div>Jacob&apos;s been repeatedly mentioning a competition that some of the other people at the gym are going to be participating in, including Jose. on friday? I think it&apos;d be nice if I go to watch, with some of the bjj people maybe if they&apos;re going too. to solidify my place in the group. but I haven&apos;t much faith in that happening.</div><div><br/></div><div>Cody texted me in the evening again asking me what I&apos;m up to, and we ended up going to flip burger for food. so I was able to get my flip burger fix after all. while eating, I listened to him vent his frustrations with coworkers young and old who don&apos;t know how to properly use the features on their design software, as well as their outdated and inefficient methods of office communication and information sharing. then asked me what programs I use at work. he also informed me that the question Dorothy had asked me on facebook about my &quot;experience with something&quot; referred to smoking, as she wanted to try it herself. I thought that was quite funny.</div><div><br/></div><div>I mentioned that I made a tinder account, and Cody just reiterated that I should just try it out and see what happens. the longer I build it up in my head, the more disappointing it&apos;s going to be.</div><div><br/></div><div>we then had a little more fun poking at Barb and her Charlie, how they were probably embarrassed after the shit that happened at the campground. apparently she was at the Tia&apos;s place, that time that Cody texted me about going to, that I didn&apos;t feel like going to. coincidentally she lives in the element. Cody said that she was being unresponsive towards his texts about where to park etc. even though she was the one who invited him over. I think he said he ended up just going home.</div><div><br/></div><div>Cody said he&apos;d message me tomorrow (today) but he didn&apos;t.</div><div><br/></div><div>sunday: nothing</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">4-23 m</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>all weekend, I had completely forgotten that I had the day off today, until after I already got a workout in this morning and made my way to the office. I figured I would just go home after eating my fast food breakfast, but that fucking Greg from the other company had to just had to come in too. and he was meeting with someone and the Anthony showed up also. I expected him to ask me what I was doing there, but he was preoccupied I guess.</div><div>at the gym today, Mallory addressed me by my name for the first time. then complimented my haircut by saying it looks good. she&apos;s been slightly friendlier towards me lately, I feel. she and Hannah continued to advise me while drilling. doing that little handshake thing. I heard Mallory&apos;s competing in the near future too, so she was getting a lot of practice with me and Hannah. Jacob complimented my awareness a couple times. I feel like I know more options to choose from now. we continued to work out and talk for a little bit after class. Hannah brought a bag of donuts for Jacob and sort of asked if I wanted her to bring me food from her workplace too.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">4-25 w</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>again I find myself questioning my decision to join the BJJ class at all. I started feeling some anxiety about it, as I thought about my right elbow and my left pinky toe. Jacob doesn&apos;t give me as much encouragement to me as he does to the others. maybe he can tell that I&apos;m not really into it seriously. I don&apos;t feel like I belong as a member of the group.</div><div><br/></div><div>I ended up skipping again today, and I expect the others to not care so much. I stayed late at the office, but that was only part of the reason. the Danny and Anthony have been bombarding me with new requirements the past couple days, finally giving me some more work to do. I wonder if Danny can see my frustration at the process. even moderate stress like this makes me think about quitting this job, but I can&apos;t even allow myself to fantasize about that because I have such low confidence in my ability to leave and find another job. for now it&apos;s easy to continue imaging that Hannah isn&apos;t as good as me.</div><div><br/></div><div>Zach showed up at nearly 5 pm today. apparently he had a shit time after 420 fest last weekend; according to him he had to walk several miles home after whoever was driving him refused to go all the way, and then his car was towed and he had pay a hefty fee to get it back. he seems to attract a lot of shit luck.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">4-27 f</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>even though it&apos;s late and my head is buzzing. I&apos;ll write down what I can.</div><div><br/></div><div>we went to a place, the daiquiri factory. supposedly for Aaron&apos;s birthday. it was the usual drinking. they had semi-frozen slushy alcoholic drinks. nothing interesting happened there. a group of young attractive girls sat down near us and we kept talking about them and how they looked like jailbait. at some point the discussion, particularly between the Anthony and Aaron, turned again toward Aaron&apos;s weight, how he shouldn&apos;t be suffering from his health issues at his age, and that he should work on losing it. Aaron kept nodding in agreement. Zach never showed up.</div><div><br/></div><div>I decided to stick around with the remainders for the rest of the night instead of leaving on my own this time. so the Anthony wanted to go to a strip club, and I revealed that I had never been to one before, and the rest of them couldn&apos;t believe it. they wanted to take me, and I decided that I wasn&apos;t going to say no. they, actually just Anthony, kept talking about my shirt, the new silk shirt that I had just gotten and decided to wear out. the place we went to was called cheetah, and it was somewhere I had driven past dozens of times. Danny paid the entry fee for all of us and I wandered inside with the rest of them and saw a lot of things for the first time in my life. I focused on being okay with it all without trying too hard. Anthony, Danny, and RJ kept reassuring me and telling me about how things go in a place like this. the several strippers who stopped by your table could definitely tell that I didn&apos;t know how to handle this. I kept thinking about how this was their job, and wondering what it was like for them as they applied for something like this. Anthony was totally drunk and basically imparting strip club wisdom on me. I was slightly too wary and everyone who stopped by our table and didn&apos;t know what to say. I saw vagina for the first time. is it better this way?</div><div><br/></div><div>the first table dance was from a girl whose stripper name was Tyler (?) and the second from some semi-asian girl who I wasn&apos;t interested in. the others kept telling everybody that this was first time at a strip club. eventually I gave in to the peer pressure and got a lap dance from the Tyler when I next saw her on stage. Anthony went over to talk to her first, then came back and relayed to me that she wanted me to approach her myself. and I stood up and went over to her. she then took my hand and led me to the private rooms. as I said to Danny, she smelled nice and made me feel special. I couldn&apos;t which of the things she said were just part of the job, and which, if any, she genuinely meant. some people liked my jacket. some my shirt. one of them said they didn&apos;t go well together. she said I&apos;m cute, and I want to believe that. I told her I liked her titties. she&apos;s 26 and I&apos;m 25. I told her she smelled lovely. she said it was because of some essential oil, I forget which one. I put my hands all over her as much as I dared, feeling her legs, her back, her breasts, her butt, her pubic hair. she called me naughty. I liked it when she pressed herself against me. she was good at what she does. of course. afterwards I could tell she was like bored of me and wanted to move on to someone else. we only hung out for a few minutes afterwards, during which I said little because I didn&apos;t know what. the whole experience cost me close to $300 at least. she kept putting her nipples in my mouth and rubbing her chest into my face. according to her, she never/rarely does that. this is all way too important to me. I was more physically intimate with this random person than I&apos;ve ever been with anyone else.</div><div><br/></div><div>by the time I was done the others had left. Danny sent me a text five minutes before telling me they were heading out. I called an uber home and wrote all of this.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">4-29 n</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>I can feel myself delaying this transcription all day. I must be afraid of confronting my emotions.</div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday Cody wasn&apos;t at the running meetup, but I did run into David, and that other asian girl who I saw during one of the first times. her name is Diana and she remembers me too. I think maybe I didn&apos;t feel quite as afraid this time. or I cared less. or something. David and I briefly ran together with another person, and he mentioned that I smiled a lot. I made a joke about it, but secretly I was happy to hear that.</div><div><br/></div><div>Hannah said she&apos;d be at the bjj class today, but she didn&apos;t appear. I later saw that I&apos;d been included in a messaging group she made, which also had the Jacob and Mallory, explaining that she wasn&apos;t there because uber was busier than usual or something. she had sort of invited me? to go to this inman park festival that she wanted to attend. for a little while I thought maybe she could come over and do whatever while I showered to get ready to go, just like those two times I ended up at her place, boredly waiting while she showered. but I didn&apos;t feel like going anywhere.</div><div><br/></div><div>the purple Phil was there again. he&apos;s slightly better than me when we&apos;re rolling, and gives me a fist pump afterwards. the two of us practiced the omoplata with her, and we&apos;re all quiet. Mallory usually smells like laundry detergent.</div><div><br/></div><div>my mind was still reeling all day yesterday after my lap dance experience on friday. I kept thinking about the girl. it&apos;s a new trap I can&apos;t help falling for. when I wasn&apos;t having imaginary conversations with her in my head, I was wondering what she looked like doing normal things. eating. washing her clothes. exercising. how memorable I might have or not have been. if I&apos;m this weird person she&apos;s going to tell her friends about. if she&apos;ll ever think about me at all. how much of a front it all was. I thought about how I was more physically intimate with this girl than I&apos;ve been with anyone else in my whole life. I had my hands all over her and it was good thing I was drunk enough to keep my nerves level, or I would have been too anxious to enjoy any of it. her skin on her butt was cool to the touch. her breasts were soft and I brushed my fingers over her nipples some, but I don&apos;t remember how they felt. I told her that I liked her &quot;little titties.&quot; I don&apos;t remember what she smelled like. I barely remember any of the things we talked about. she felt hot despite being naked. she&apos;s 26. something about &quot;nerdy&quot; vs. &quot;geeky&quot;. she did look a little nerdy/geeky. how many other men had rubbed their own hands all over her too? how much of dancing was muscle memory? I keep thinking of better things I could have said in response to the things she said.</div><div><br/></div><div>I expect that Anthony and Danny will probably ask me how it went. I&apos;m not sure what I&apos;ll tell them if they do. earlier that day I was once again on edge about Anthony as I listened to him say things during our company&apos;s hot dog day. Danny had gotten the exact jalapeno cheddar dogs that Cody and I got for the camping trip last month. the John Park kept making remarks on how little I talk. Danny gave a demo about something. I found Anthony&apos;s comments sometimes and didn&apos;t care at other times.</div><div><br/></div><div>they actually kind of make an effort to drag me out to the socializations. at the daiquiri factory. my shirt stood out immediately so there was some talk about that. I also wore the denim jacket that RJ liked, and he remembered it. I learned that it was Andrew who had asked whose ip address is 127.0.0.1, something that I&apos;ve heard Anthony bring up over and over again. when I walked over to the bathroom, I saw a guy wearing a balmain t-shirt.</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s interesting that I happened to decide to wear the new silk shirt I&apos;d just bought. before going out for the evening. if I&apos;d decided to just stay in my hoodie I know I would have felt so self-conscious at the strip club. so the fact that I felt like I looked good helped me. also noteworthy is the fact that I owe this whole experience...to Anthony. he couldn&apos;t believe that I&apos;d never been to one before, and told me that I have a lot of catching up to do. I know it&apos;s true.</div><div><br/></div><div>earlier this week, Dorothy included me in a group text inviting us out to dinner together on sunday (today). I can&apos;t remember if I&apos;ve already written about this. I&apos;ve a feeling I was only on the list because she wants to hear about my &quot;pot experience.&quot; I&apos;m going to look for an opportunity to mention the strip club. Cody&apos;s in the group too but he never responded to anything so I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ll be there.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>the two unknowns in Dorothy&apos;s group message were her Heather, and Jay. I felt relaxed and at ease around them all. I felt a surge when they finally got around to asking me about my smoking, which they admitted was&nbsp;</div><div>the reason for this hangout. Dorothy said that Cody had made it sound like that time I smoked with his friends was the first time I ever did. I don&apos;t know when he told her about me.</div><div><br/></div><div>they&apos;re planning a &quot;potluck&quot; some time in the next few weeks. the plan is to get some edibles from one of Cody&apos;s friends and hang out and get high together. I never got a chance to tell them about the club. or rather I missed it.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><b>4-30 m</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>well, no one&apos;s really asked me anything at work today so I guess i was wrong. other than Anthony asking me when everyone left (?) and Danny saying that apparently I made it out okay on my own. the two of them and the John Park went out to lunch together today and they must have told him about me, because when they got back he asked me how the vip room was.</div><div><br/></div><div>I let out some of my feelings to petunia. first mentioning it to her yesterday, and she said that it&apos;d make a good &quot;wank memory.&quot; I didn&apos;t bother correcting her on that.it felt slightly better to have someone to tell about this thing. to help me process these new emotions, I suppose. I said I should pay her a visit at the ross she works at, and she said she&apos;d like to meet me. after I tentatively proposed talking outside of the game, she gave me her facebook &quot;handle.&quot; of course I went and looked it up, and it&apos;s a sort of shady-looking profile. it&apos;s similar to ROdNEY&apos;s in that there&apos;s just a lot of random content without much of the typical socializing-type activity from other people. there&apos;re some selfies of some guy, and unless petunia is actually this guy, I still have no idea who she could be.</div><div><br/></div><div>last night I watched two vlog-type videos uploaded by a youtuber who I&apos;ve been watching since around 2012 (RaedwulfGamer). in them he describes the pain he&apos;s going through, having separating from his girlfriend of eight years, and also declares being madly in love with a girl who&apos;s 19. it felt absolutely surreal hearing the things he talked about. like it couldn&apos;t be real. I&apos;d been watching his videos for so long, watching his personality transform, it just didn&apos;t seem possible that his personal life could be so destabilized. it was all so strange that I&apos;m writing about it now. he&apos;s since deleted the videos. maybe he was intoxicated when he uploaded them. he had mentioned that they could be the last ones he&apos;ll ever make. I wonder if this person will just disappear.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>I guess it turns out that petunia is the weird-looking guy in his facebook photos. now I can no longer remember what led me to believe that he was a woman this whole time, other than him calling himself a slut. now in retrospect it almost seems to make sense, when I think about the way he talks. but I&apos;m probably just twisting my memory. it felt disappointing, honestly. I&apos;m not as interested in talking to him now, because I feel I&apos;ve been misled.</div><div><br/></div><div>ROdNEY shared his thoughts with me after I told him about my strip club experience. they were about what I&apos;d expect from him. he thinks it doesn&apos;t make sense to pay for anything like that.</div><div><br/></div><div>the Walter was present in class today, and he&apos;s significant better than me when we&apos;re rolling. he&apos;s a decent sport about it I guess, but I get frustrated if I think about it too much.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<div>grossness is creeping back up on me. i'm sitting at the starbucks table like i used to. i haven't done anything important, even though i keep reminding myself to. rita and michelle are in my databases class, along with sally. michelle looked no different from the way she did in barcelona. i guess few people do, but they just doesn't feel foreign here. rita smiled seemingly excitedly when she saw me. i stopped in my tracks for a second while we were taking our seats so it wouldn't seem like i'm so automatically sitting next to her, but she smiled at me again. michelle didn't smile so much, though she did come sit next to us and rita. whenever i was saying something to rita i mumbled and had to repeat myself because i subconsciously didn't want sally to hear what i was saying. why am i a mumbler? rita said see you later! when class ended and left before i answered. i spotted csukas and sanat in the social psychology lecture hall. sanat caught my eye from across the room and looked away. so they didn't care i was here. i walked over to the other side of the room and he said hi dan and i ended up sitting two seats over from him. minna then surprised me by deciding to next to me, without yet fully remembering who i was because we haven't seen each other for a long time. i felt a kind of relief wash over me when i recognized her. there's at least one person i recognize in every class i have now and that makes me that much less stressed. lonely lunch at the food court. then i caught eddy throwing at trash at the same time as i was and was surprised that i felt genuinely happy to see him. i also saw caroline standing under a tent outside the crc.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this evening i saw cecili on the phone while walking to the culc for the acf scavenger hunt. she was on her phone and i followed her planning to call out her name if she hung up, but she didn't by the time i reached the entrance so i let her go. saw chris julian sitting with some guys at starbucks. i don't know if he saw me. i didn't feel like mingling with any freshmen. saw sierra on the steps in between the culc and skiles. she gave me a brief wave, looking very unhappy. met urvashi on ferst near tech square. she excitedly gave me a hug and i excitedly hugged her. we didn't talk for very long and i think she said something about hanging out. talked with monique about our study abroad experiences. normal conversation with her didn't feel normal. i need to be nicer to her.</div>
<div><br/></div>

<div>last night i dreamt that i was smoking a cigarette and a big fat cigar at the same time. i was holding one in each hand. i had another dream involving a chase through a gravel parking lot at night. there were white street lights. cars parked around a wooden building in the middle.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today i saw marie while standing around with new ACF people outside the student center ballroom. she emerged from some meeting concerning tech's international plan. she slowly walked up to me and hugged me with an arm. i used two. ethan waved to me when he saw me come up the stairs. i unenthusiastically lifted my wrist. i wonder if i feel how marie does when she waves so dully.</div>

<div>yesterday enoch pulled me into an empty room before ACF started and told me i wouldn't be on the leadership team anymore. so the end began. of course they noticed the things i've been doing over the summer. i can't say that i'm surprised it took them long, because it didn't take them very long. he referred to my choices as a path i'm taking. the thing that concerns me most is that i wasn't worried about being kicked off the leadership team at all. i know i should be worried about my supposed friends, but many never clicked with me and i kind of want to say fuck you to them anytime i see them. at the same time i need them too much.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>he started it off by asking me if i really wanted to be an ACF leader, and i lied. he effortlessly rebuked my feeble attempt to get around the question. told me that several people had approached with worries specifically about me, and when i asked who and how many of them, said that just one was too many. i'm too eager to prove to him, the next time i see him, that i don't resent him for doing this, by smiling at him or shaking his hand when he holds it out to me or something. it won't prove anything.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>earlier yesterday i went with patrick to a liquor store and bought a bottle of malibu and a bottle of kraken. i paid him $30. we talked about frat parties.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i hate crowds. the ACF room swarmed with unfamiliar people and i didn't want to mingle with them. monique always seems to become more reserved whenever she's talking to me. after my short conversation with enoch i went outside and stood around with mike and tam. thought about tam and hyo jae, how i thought i they would make good friends and how no friendship bonds ever formed. tam seemed overly excited, to me, to take up responsibilities. i only got happy when i saw melissa arrive, in heels and carrying a heavy backpack. she said i seemed even shier today. i speak really quietly with her. kept exchanging sentences in mandarin. they passed out flyers for the 40. i don't plan to go this year. on the &quot;meal tickets&quot; they printed out for the newcomers for fill in information, i filled in that i didn't go a church, wasn't looking for one, and wasn't interested in any of their intramurals. i'm not confident that i'll be able to find something better if i leave them. if i leave their safe shores..i think i'll get devoured out in the sea. they're all nice people, to be sure. the ACF guys. but even helen is a nice person. (i showed her how to manually change her DSLR's focus points. remembering the time chris julian showed me how on his own camera..)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>spend a lot of time with melissa. we went to my room and i was trying to be all gentlemanly and she just watched me play dead space 2. told me about many other games, which i couldn't absorb all at once. she said she's a good judge of character. i thought about v. hugged again when she left. she told me to not walk her out to her car. she got home safely.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i had a glass of the kraken rum and got drunk. i wasn't expecting to get as drunk as i did. my face didn't glow hard. i excitedly went to sam's room when i finished the glass and talked to him while drunk. i spilled out too much information to him. i wonder how many other people know about me and how many can see what i'm doing to myself. possibles: david, monique. steph?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm convinced that no matter what &quot;path&quot; i take, i'll be just fine as long as my heart still genuinely loves everyone at the end of the day.</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>i don't know if leah has been in the same cs4911 section as me since day one of school, but she sat behind me and i recognized her as she was bending down looking away from me while looking through her backpack. she didn't look in my direction when she passed me the role sheet.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i need to learn to accept the 3 groupmates that sam is friends with for cs4911. they are knowledgeable but not amusing to me. they didn't seem keen to talk to me or sam, but my vision is probably skewed in regards to that and i didn't say anything to them either, really.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today we had the surprise party at the cheesecake factory for angela's boyfriend david. i rode in sam's car with steph and they talked a little about people from their past and when was the last time they were here or there with who. i remembered back when i still liked her how much i hated hearing them talk about their old friends and places that were familiar, as far as i was concerned, only to them. david was successfully surprised. our waiter and waitress were both very nice. i ordered &quot;papas bravas&quot; and when someone asked me what it was that i ordered i said &quot;patatas bravas&quot; instead because that's what they were to me. david craft joined us late because he had RA business with a fire drill. he told me about hannah's stressful issues with her boyfriend and some seriously extremist disapproving parents who don't like the boy she's dating because she isn't asian/korean. it was really easy to think about her crying over it. i can't really imagine what she must feel, nor can i really hope for her. after the dinner we loitered outside the entrance for-fucking-ever. i really don't understand some asian behavior, nor how loitering so is somehow a stereotypical asian trait. some of us did helium. i tried it too but it lasted only a second. i had even planned out something to say while everyone else was just saying &quot;hello  hello&quot; but it didn't last long enough on me and everyone was disappointed. i wasn't sure if sam was appreciative of me plugging in my phone to play music. he kept it quiet for a while. we took angela and two of her girl friends in the car on the way back and her two friends expressed surprise when she said she's had alcohol. i think she was at france this summer.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>kelly messaged me on facebook again. what the fuck does she want this time? asking me about the book she gave me last christmas again?</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday when i saw urvashi at the CULC entrance and after we hugged and briefly talked sam said i was &quot;so popular&quot; in his &quot;so popular&quot; voice. it was fucking annoying.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
august 31:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this morning kelly asked me if i was pursuing God. i told her i wasn't sure and realized i'm still not ready to choose.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i saw michelle vu while approaching sixth street. we didn't hug..maybe because i was holding a box and a chick fil-a bag. she said she still reads what i post to my tumblr.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i got slightly tipsy off before going to ACF today. i wonder if anyone noticed. listened to enoch talk. he said that ACF was one place where we would never feel alone. i want to call bullshit because of how lonely i had felt for such a good portion of last year, but it was probably just my problem again. i and texted melissa but she still hasn't answered. played a shitty game with hula hoops. i signed up for david's small group. hope no one noticed how red in the face i was. steph kind of gave me a weird look when i got up to go the bathroom. enoch gave me a copy of the book the circle maker he had bought for me. it's about prayer.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at five guys i had for a little while a nice conversation with monique about study abroad experiences and books. she loved the great gatsby too. i don't feel bad in any way about enjoying that book anymore, what with what david told me last night. i wanted to sit next to her, but caught kelly's attention and sat by her for a bit. she asked me if i finished reading the book she gave me last christmas. i never even realized that she had bought it for me and it was for me to keep. now i'm sure i'm not giving her enough credit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i didn't talk to any new freshman, really. i wonder how many new people i'm going end up meeting this year.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>kelly kept asking jane questions about her boyfriend on the way back. i talked to her for short snippets at a time.</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>evaporated. monique is no longer my audience.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i had forgotten that jessie has a tattoo on her wrist. i can't remember which wrist it's on. but i think it's on the right.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>here is everything that happened beginning from 9 days ago:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>prior to each of years 2 and 3, i had always found my way to a group of ACF now-veterans to mingle with during the weekend before school started. this time there was none of that. not just because everybody was gone, but i also didn't feel like trying to find anybody. i had learned by now that joining one of those would only stress me out. so i didn't see anybody on the first saturday or sunday. on monday i spotted the girl who looks like jessie. i re-met everyone at the volleyball court on tuesday. i almost told monique that i missed her face. jennifer said that she's never heard me talk before (again). only louisa was fun to talk to. saw a couple of awkwardly behaving people, more reminders of what not to be like. and yan said that it sad for me to be leaving after his year, but i'm not sure what she meant by that. i formally met emily. later that evening i ate dinner with her, jared, and one of his friends, and there emily told all of us her life story while jared and i kept quiet. i kept quiet because i didn't know what to say. i was just thinking about i don't have a life story. emily has a tattoo of &quot;Corinthians something&quot; where something is the verse number that i don't remember. she got it at the tattoo parlor right next to firehouse subs. the next day i friended her on facebook and haven't communicated with her since. i saw david that evening, and he put his arm on my shoulder and i stupidly reciprocated the gesture. it was supposed to be ACF's game night day in their week of events, but almost nobody showed up and i found it rather funny that nobody did. helen kept petting everyone's hair. not mine of course, but i didn't want her to anyway. i think it makes her feel appreciated, but i have no way of knowing for sure. caught a brief glimpse of steph that day. while at walmart on thursday, yan said that our names rhyme. duly noted. and on friday, i saw jessie again.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i dreamt about friday the night before friday. in the dream i saw jessie's face as we saw each other for the first time in around one and a half years. i think i want to date her. only i have a crush on her now like i did back in my freshman year, so i need to pay attention. at the same time i can relax a little. when we met for real in front of tin drum, jessie said &quot;it's been so long!&quot; and then gave me a side hug. i think other people saw us, and my right arm hanging limply after i realized that i wouldn't get to use it. what did we catch up on? the reason i never saw jessie at all last year is because she took that one off from school to go work in taiwan. i saw a picture of her facebook, of her..fishing..indoors somewhere, presumably in taiwan, and i when gazed at that picture i felt something not about her. but it had to do with being in another country and having a fun free time there.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i don't know why i keep bringing up ACF in our conversations, now that i don't feel so strongly attached to it anymore. she kept asking about small groups. i think i still don't want to go to small groups. kelly, the annoying one, is gone, with a lot of the other graduates, so if jessie actually does start coming to these meetings things will be very different for her. i know it's selfish, but i hope that her not knowing any of the new people there will make her more likely to stick to me. experience says such a thing is not going to happen, but if i can simply say whatever is on my mind at every moment i know i'll be fine because i'll have expressed myself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i was happy when, after we ate our lunches, she got and said &quot;we need to do this again&quot; and that it was fun. she drove me in her new-but-not-anymore car. it's still a mini cooper, just like louisa and her new RAV4. beginning today i'm not going to exhaust myself texting her. i'm afraid that it will be harshly obvious if i suddenly begin talking to her a lot, now that she's here again. obvious that i'm trying to snatch her that way. i also wanted to ask her if she's changed at all since we last saw each other, but i didn't because i don't know what i would have said about myself in regards to that.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>finally, i want ACF to no longer be my crutch. it's a ghost now, a shell, filled with the kind of emptiness that i hate.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i also find it strange when andrew or vince speak to me, they sound so normal when they say something my way. on the other hand, i feel like people like monique and yan dial themselves down when they face me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
; 8-29 </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i watched a video on vimeo titled <i>the innovation of loneliness</i> and now i realize why i hate seeing everybody on facebook so much, and why trying to text jessie stresses me out. Zora, though, i want her to remain something else (for now). looking at rita, john, tanner, and rahul nearly makes me physically sick. looking at michelle doesn't. odd? i identify a potential problem, made manifest in finding comfort in seeing other people in the same position as me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night was an ordinary night, an ordinary dark spiral night, and i could feel my mind spinning, and throbbing, as it fell into a darkness that wasn't sleep. i was able to gleefully ignore her last message, which she must have known as well as i did was equivalent to END, HANG UP.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i had to inform Zora, my newest outlet, that jessie would rather go grocery shopping than hang out with me, then that i Guess she's not the one! Lol. and she said that if she is the one then i will feel it in my heart. i don't feel a thing in my heart, so, then she isn't the one…perhaps it really is that simple.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and she just texted me! i'm very happy. my atmosphere is foreboding, heavy nimbus clouds rolling inside me, i'm breathing in thunder. lightning always strikes eventually, and it hits hard. lightning isn't friendly, it sets things on fire.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it may have hit me already. she might have intended to text her &quot;boyfriend.&quot; she's told me that she texts &quot;hey&quot; to him every MORNING. how ironic. she freaks out like this too, on me. ~</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a girl next to me reads a text on her phone and laughs.</div>

<div><br/></div><div>what exactly has it been a month since?</div><div><br/></div><div>things must surely be dissolving by now. i couldn't have seen it in real time but i can notice progress. or regress, rather. there's a lot of that going on.</div><div><br/></div><div>asta was the one to rekindle the fire this time, but it's starting to become very stale. actually it started quite a while ago. but if she doesn't give up, i won't.</div><div><br/></div><div>zora meanwhile is clinging to dear life in my book. i was happy when she texted me but her lackluster answers are frustrating. maybe i'll open myself more just to get her to say something.</div><div><br/></div><div>as much as i would like demote monique as a source of perspective, too significant a portion of such an action's motivation would be devoted to a laughably selfish and useless spite. so she remains an occasional critical reminder. she and jessie, affecting me annoyingly magically. the latter is truly living the dream</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
8-5</div><div><br/></div><div>so i like people like [the] Toni, the always upbeat kind who i am able to draw energy from  to help break down my b orders. she and the woman who i thought looked like taylor swift at first talked and laughed a lot while driving to Jalisco. they had a lot of positive energy compared to the likes of [the] Patrick and [the] Greg, who i find nearly impossible to interact with and whose qualities i myself assume when i'm around them.</div><div><br/></div><div>[the] Toni recognized me as a &quot;quiet funny&quot; type (and maybe others do too) who was emerging from a shell. I could feel it, too, just a little bit off in this new setting. still hesitant, like i'd rather save it for a future, non-guaranteed time.</div><div><br/></div><div>the other two dudes in [the] Toni's car paid no attention to her and [the] Marie's exchanges, but i could tell they were trying hard to ignore her, while i was trying to join her. don't be like them. it's like they simply can't handle the slightest quirk in a strange person. don't know what to do, how to react.</div><div><br/></div><div>but, i have consistently misjudged hordes of people since my arrival.</div><div><br/></div><div>steph invited me to an ACF-centered hangout, which was nice to see.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
8-20 w</div><div><br/></div><div>entries few and far between. i like my new office location a lot more. now that i'm not sharing with [the] Patrick and that no one can see what i'm doing, i feel a lot more at ease i'm sitting in the corner behind my desk and feel quite cozy as i avoid my responsibilities.</div><div><br/></div><div>an apparently homeless man was camping outside the burger king drive-through, preying on the drivers who knows how long. i think the workers in the windows knew. i had no bills on me, but for reason i had the cover to a little compartment in my car's center console, full of loose change, open, i have no idea why. he persuaded me twice to hand over another small finger full of coins. in all i gave him a few dollars and had a lot left. felt bad for feeling annoyed. was afraid the workers were watching and laughing.</div><div><br/></div><div>the ice cream social had always been an informal gathering, so i went over to the volleyball courts to see who would be there. no one in my window. the evening was the most disappointed i'd been in a while. i almost felt unwelcome. the area was a green zone very recently, but now i no longer belong here. it's like being decommissioned from the KND. I felt relief when i saw dpak sauntering up because he would know what my situation is like, he's been in the same one. we must be older than 99% of the population  now.</div><div><br/></div><div>i only really talked to clement in brief exchanges, and as i did so i came to the horrifying realization that he was feeding me filler to fatten up the time. i tasted what i wanted to taste - insincerity, and a hint of contempt. in particular when he asked me if i have a church to go to. i told him no. he said i could ask him/go with him, while gazing distantly (i bet). i don't feel a lot of love anymore. my window is up.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
8-30 s</div><div><br/></div><div>i appear to renege as much as i think the others are.</div><div><br/></div><div>i didn't have a bad time today, but these gatherings have never, ever been fulfilling. steph asked me how i've been and i don't know what the fuck she meant. a good portion of the pasta i made went uneaten and the bottle of sangria i brought was immediately forgotten. an indian girl was there and when she introduced herself i almost thought i knew her because her name is melanie. i borrowed david's swim shorts so i could get in the pool. only three others went in. some lifeguard jokes made. how did alex know/&quot;remember&quot; that i was one, anyway? did i ever tell him? we watched the movie white chicks, which i thought was funny, and then left. at midnight.</div><div><br/></div><div>mike was there and i told him, &quot;<strike>it's like</strike> nothing has changed&quot; or something and he said that that's exactly what i said last time. he was right?</div><div><br/></div><div>&quot;leaving&quot; has always resonated with me.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div><b>8-1 m</b></div><div><br/></div><div>last week I donated more things to goodwill that they will probably throw away most of. among them were the generic surplus and dc pure se shoes. it&apos;s still been under a year since starting to wear the greats sneakers I&apos;m still wearing, and I was in fact in the dc pure se&apos;s as recently as last june when I was with kat at the beach. I&apos;m most likely thinking of her more than she is of me.</div><div><br/></div><div>I played two l4d2 maps with Zora and two of her other friends on friday, and I was able to get along with them fairly well. we were in a group skype call to talk to each other and I had to put on headphones so they wouldn&apos;t hear my game sounds. she turned her camera on for a bit and I could see her room and her cat. I&apos;m sure I miss our old times more than she does too. beginning in late 2012.</div><div><br/></div><div>DOOGIE has disappeared. for the past week or so. I&apos;d like to see if I can go the month without playing L4D2 (unless Zora calls again), but I know that if he shows up I&apos;ll cave. one of the various ways I can&apos;t trust myself anymore. it&apos;s become difficult for me to say no again.</div><div><br/></div><div>for a couple days I talked with ROdNEY&apos;s friend Karel after he initiated a conversation about depression. he went through something bad six years ago involving a girl and didn&apos;t go into any details. I didn&apos;t bother pressing him because I wouldn&apos;t have been able to understand if he explained more anyway. he quickly determined that I wasn&apos;t really depressed, which I took offense to, but probably because part of me secretly agreed, and his conclusion was just reinforcing something I&apos;ve feared for a while.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>8-6 s</b></div><div><br/></div><div>now I&apos;m always starting off with, &quot;it&apos;s been [x amount of time]&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s been over a week since I had that conversation with monique. I&apos;m just afraid that I got too sappy and didn&apos;t know what I was saying to her, and that she doesn&apos;t really value me at all. I told v a little bit about it and he said she seems like a mess. just based on that one little piece.</div><div><br/></div><div>how odd that my only &quot;friends&quot; nowadays are DOOGIE, ROdNEY, and maybe even Karel, if he doesn&apos;t hate me too much already. v and maybe mo are hanging by threads.</div><div><br/></div><div>the first anniversary for life is strange episode 4 has passed and I honestly can&apos;t believe it. the next step is &apos;until dawn&apos;. and I still can&apos;t over how little I can remember of the 2/3 of the year that has passed while I wasn&apos;t watching.</div><div><br/></div><div>this new environment is now a missed opportunity. I haven&apos;t used it to try to enact any change whatsoever.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>8-8 m</b></div><div><br/></div><div>the universe continues to expand and my element continues to shrink. the amount of space that is now &quot;out of my element&quot; has become too massive to approach. I stay here in my room full of one-way windows because it&apos;s the safest space I have. each year brings more decay. in my fantasies, I am alone.</div><div><br/></div><div>then the space becomes too mundane and I try to do something to spruce it up. move something around, rearrange this, so far I&apos;ve added some shelves and lights. for nobody.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>8-10 w</b></div><div><br/></div><div>today I reached a new low as I paid $14.95 for a 30-day membership on beautiful agony.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>8-13 s</b></div><div><br/></div><div>halfway home. I&apos;ve never felt more disconnected than this, it keeps getting more and more unreal. I feel like I&apos;m regressing in every way. I haven&apos;t been not looking forward to going home so much as not really thinking about it. I had much less to pack this time but I still didn&apos;t leave until nearly noon, but still made it to the hotel well within 9:30. the trip has never been faster. it&apos;s unbelievable. I can&apos;t listen to music of the past two years anymore. it&apos;s become much less effective. missed the rest stop with many trees, but somehow found the same starbucks that I&apos;d stopped at last winter. I can barely remember august seeming so far away. I can barely remember the disappointment in having to wait almost two extra months for the trip home this year, and it ended like nothing. the long wait, nothing. I can remember nothing. I can&apos;t remember anything. my brain has melted too much and I can no longer think. I&apos;m losing cognitive ability.</div><div><br/></div><div>on thursday I went to lunch with bina to flip burger boutique. of course I hadn&apos;t been there in a year, and last time it was with krish. I didn&apos;t think much of it. I got the same burger as I did that time. bina told me a little bit about her rocky relationships with some of her family and siblings. I had nothing to offer, but thought of v a little bit. I&apos;ve been talking with him here and there. it seems to help. I hope it&apos;s for the better.</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s finally becoming easier to talk to christian.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>8-14 n</b></div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m back at home and I don&apos;t care.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>8-16 t</b></div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m seeing faint glimmers of hope for the future. it helps to be away from atlanta, from the too-familiar setting that I have spent so much time in that I no longer notice what it&apos;s doing to me. I can see all the distractions I&apos;ve been trying to jump around on, I can see my time running out. I can think of so many things I can and should be doing, but I can no longer trust myself to summon the energy to do any of them. I&apos;ll find some excuse, I&apos;ll always look for another distraction, and that kind of task I&apos;ll always succeed at because I want it more than the actual important goal. I know what I need to do but now how to make myself want to do it enough.</div><div><br/></div><div>I told v a little bit about my stumbles, and he agreed with me. it sucks slightly, but at the same time it&apos;s definitely a good thing that I can get an outsider opinion on my situation and some advice on what to do next. I alluded to DOOGIE and v said he and the rest of them are bringing me down. this is something I needed to hear. normally I&apos;d react negatively to his snap judgement but in this case he&apos;s too right. and I&apos;ve been enjoying my time with them daily less and less.</div><div><br/></div><div>today I had my bottom permanent retainer removed. a few days ago, lillian and sam broke up. I literally can&apos;t imagine how painful it must have been for her. there&apos;s nothing happening here.</div><div><br/></div><div>reminiscing to music while driving no longer works. its effect is nearly negligible now. I think I also need to stop focusing so much on engineering these playlists, and reduce my existing ones. this is excessive effort spent on a fleeting product that is begging to be meaningful, that won&apos;t last, that is intangible to all others and will become so to me as well.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>8-22 m</b></div><div><br/></div><div>I think I&apos;ve mentioned already that using music to reminisce while driving isn&apos;t so effective anymore, but it&apos;s nice that everything in atlanta is still so easily forgotten while I&apos;m up here. my apartment, the office, bina, christian. none of it feels real. which is upset by knowing I&apos;ll be returning to it soon. it&apos;s like I completely suspend one environment while I&apos;m in the other. it&apos;s like when thinking back to a vivid lucid dream you had that felt so astoundingly real while you were in it, yet unfailingly becomes infinitely distant upon waking up. I go to sleep in one world and wake up in the other. the highway connects them together.</div><div><br/></div><div>I wish I could remember more about college. I&apos;ve tried making a list of recollection images, but could barely come up with anything. it&apos;s already longer ago than I realize. even when I recall my first apartment, it doesn&apos;t feel real. large amounts of time with nothing to remember, too much effort on recalling the past, and inability to focus on the present.</div><div><br/></div><div>we sent my brother off to his school, cornell, this weekend. the house now does feel a little emptier without him. not as surreal as it could be, though. it still doesn&apos;t feel as empty as the day after a party. I don&apos;t know how I feel about not being sadder than I am.</div><div><br/></div><div>thinking about how he is now the age I was when I started school takes some effort to trip me out. I know he&apos;s doing way better than me in just about every aspect, so at least I have nothing to worry about there. he seemed rather eager to leave and stay at school among his various friends he already has. way more than I had. I wonder how he felt while packing, preparing to leave home, his final night &quot;as a child&quot;, his first night in his dorm. because I remember how I felt, and still feel every time there&apos;s a drastic environmental change, internally screaming and desperately lonely.</div><div><br/></div><div>which is why I was able to indulge in knowing I could be relaxed this time around, because all of the factors that would have stressed me out I wouldn&apos;t have to deal with this time. the disorganization and disorientation were not happening to me. I didn&apos;t have to pay attention to everything going on around me and figure out where I would end up in all of it. after unloading all of his stuff in the dorm building parking lot, I looked around trying to identify the other first time students, watching each car pulling up, each with a mountain of possessions. I had no one to talk to while my dad parked and my mom and brother moved. I watched two mothers meet each other and started wishing one of them would ask me questions so I had someone to talk to too.</div><div><br/></div><div>the stubborn perspective of my brother as my younger sibling clashed with my existing mindset of college students, who I still kind of subconsciously identify with. part of my mind never moved on. now suddenly every one of them has to match my brother&apos;s level. they&apos;re all younger than me, and that messes me up. part of it is due to me always assuming everyone else is above or equal to me. that&apos;s the way it is with alice. everyone who I stood eye to eye with is now moved down one level. or I&apos;m forced to admit that I&apos;m up one level, and I don&apos;t feel ready.</div><div><br/></div><div>after milling about inside his dorm room, I became lonely enough to send tom a text. I wonder what he thought about me telling him that I was at his school, how he felt about it (&quot;I feel fine lol&quot;), how he could be thinking the same thing that I am about not giving in to the conversation. how somewhere on the grounds, he and amy were together.</div><div><br/></div><div>I actually wanted to leave and go back home this very same day, but as I lay in bed in the hotel that night I was glad we didn&apos;t rush home. I wanted nothing to do with the place, and after a quick good-bye to my brother we headed back the next day.</div><div><br/></div><div>I feel horrible at home because I spend all day doing nothing. none of my muscles are getting worked. the thought of things being this way in the long term is terrifying. I bring home more than I need to. I don&apos;t want to use anything I have. the things I tell myself I&apos;ll do, I don&apos;t even begin starting. I&apos;m even somewhat looking forward to going back down again, even though I can&apos;t even imagine it.</div><div><br/></div><div>I don&apos;t want to be the happy-go-lucky person I always imagine I am when I talk to people at work. being just a little bit silly, and half-smiling. I&apos;m already thinking about how everyone will ask me how my &quot;vacation&quot; went. and I don&apos;t want to merely say, &quot;good,&quot; but I don&apos;t want to mention how good it was either. I won&apos;t waste my time describing how odd it feels for my brother to be going to college, or bother relaying anything positive to them. I want to remember that none of them care, and that nothing I feel matters to any of them. I want to become colder and harder, and more serious. loss of innocence.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>8-24 w</b></div><div><br/></div><div>the other day my mom and I were walking out in the neighborhood and we were talking about my brother. he&apos;s been doing better than me in literally every facet of life, than I was at the time. better grades, better relationships with teachers, more friends. better clothes. which is good. I won&apos;t have to worry about him. my mom was bringing up all the things I never knew of or did when I was in high school, and I interrupted and said none of it mattered. high school is too far in the past, I said. but the truth is that I do still occasionally visit a reset point that does extend that far back.</div><div><br/></div><div>my mom will be accompanying me back down to atlanta, and while I always enjoy her company, the thought of a second person in my living space again makes me uncomfortable. even my own mother. and I&apos;m not o.k. with that. I think part of me is tired of her being the Only person I&apos;m remotely close with. I need someone else.</div><div><br/></div><div>I think I&apos;m somewhat able to simulate deeper depression now, and the thoughts drive me insane.</div><div><br/></div><div>just two days left.</div><div><br/></div><div>my writing voice has declined since everything started melting. I know it&apos;s not as coherent as it once was, ~3 years ago.</div><div><br/></div><div>I never thought I&apos;d ever admit to myself that I&apos;m glad I&apos;m still friends with ROdNEY. maybe I should keep an effort going with &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE and try harder to ignore how mad I only get in-game.</div><div><br/></div><div>my mom also keeps bringing up the phrase I used, &quot;new stage of life&quot;, now that my brother has left the nest too. she said that older people think about the past more while the younger think about the future. which struck me, because I have spent astounding amounts of time thinking about my own past.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>8-26 f</b></div><div><br/></div><div>tonight was my last night here for this break. I&apos;m not really thinking about leaving home or arriving back at atlanta, again. I do feel a little sad though, and my mom knows. it&apos;s like I&apos;m about to wake up from a dream. atlanta is reality.</div><div><br/></div><div>I was less than optimistic last time and I&apos;m just the same now. so much to do; tasks to complete, priorities to focus on. and I no longer trust myself to be able to concentrate on what needs to be done. just wondering what I&apos;ll distract myself with next.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div>8-8 t</div><div><br/></div><div>this weekend I had a very comforting dream with lisa. we were lying next to each other on a snowy mountain summit. she put her arm around me.</div><div><br/></div><div>last week I made my first ever dentist and doctor&apos;s appointments on my own. I felt disgustingly adult-like as I walked in on my own, and back out on my own.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>today I rode with the Toni and J.P. and did my best to have a conversation. my total loss of social skill really shone through and there&apos;s barely anything left to salvage at this point. I knew the J.P. wouldn&apos;t talk at all and desperately wanted to be better than him. I limit myself too much.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>8-10 r</div><div><br/></div><div>when things have been the way the are for so long, I rarely stop to think about why, how, or when they came to be.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>I didn&apos;t begin considering migrating north to see the eclipse phenomenon until yesterday afternoon, and the only person outside of work I could ask to accompany me was alice, who of course had plans already. I didn&apos;t really plan on asking any of the few people I know from work to come, and I highly doubt any of them would be willing to go several hours away. christian doesn&apos;t believe that there&apos;s a difference between 99% and 100% totality, clearly having never read any testimonials and appearing not to question his preconception. maybe that&apos;ll change, maybe not.</div><div><br/></div><div>I ended up committing to my decision by booking my first airbnb in greenville, SC. negligible chance that I won&apos;t be making the trip alone. we&apos;ll see how it goes.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>8-12 s</div><div><br/></div><div>the listlessness and loneliness is sickening and I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if it turns out I&apos;d said the same thing one or two years ago. inaction, which is always easier, piles up day after day after week and month, and now I look and wonder how everyone else got so far ahead. the constant feeling of running out of time, what should be the strongest force out there, isn&apos;t moving me. that I think is the greatest paradox of my life. how much of it so far is already irreversible?</div><div><br/></div><div>if I&apos;m to be the average of the five people I spend the most time with, I&apos;ll die an early death if I stick to the ones I know.</div><div><br/></div><div>I read a response to the google manifesto I hadn&apos;t heard about, written by a Mary-Ann, some girl who was once in an unimportant class with me, who is certainly miles ahead of me by now in more than several ways. how many people have past almost-strangers thinking of them years later? and I still wonder how I&apos;m still here?</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>8-14 m</div><div><br/></div><div>I had another dentist appointment this morning and they were a little friendlier than I was expecting. then again I had only brief exposure to them last time. it was light enough for me to make a little conversation with them. the topic landed on weather and I said that I hope it won&apos;t rain next week, and they had to ask me what was happening. so I mentioned the eclipse and they appeared to not have had it on their minds at all, given their &quot;oh yeah&quot; reactions. I thought it was interesting. apparently many people aren&apos;t really excited for it.</div><div><br/></div><div>I don&apos;t think the old man I encountered outside the garage deserves any more attention than I already mentally gave him afterwards, so I&apos;ll just briefly touch upon it with regards to myself and my perception of the world. I&apos;m not sure if I wrote about that other encounter I had with an even ruder person about a year ago, but both would be examples of revelations that I&apos;m still too soft for this world.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>8-15 t</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m not surrounded by the right people. being with them is almost certainly dragging me down. in fact I don&apos;t even have five to be an average of. I only really have two, christian and DOOGIE. and for the most part they aren&apos;t doing me many favors.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;ll always have to give christian credit for playing a big part in keeping me from derailing off the exercise and workout routine, but there are other sides to him I don&apos;t want to ignore. he continues to be inflexible in some ways, and perhaps a reason I dislike that so is because I see it in myself too. he&apos;s mentioned wishing to start running, but never has, just as I have been wanting to restart running for a long time and also never have. he still insists on carrying his big gym bag with him and I don&apos;t understand why he won&apos;t consider a slimmer alternative. today he explicitly mentioned that as a reason he can&apos;t take the tech trolley from his building in tech square (!) to the CRC. that he doesn&apos;t have a small gym bag like I do. without even thinking about the obvious solution? he&apos;s stated that he can&apos;t drive from tech-square to the CRC because it takes too long to leave his parking garage. how does the trolley not solve this problem?</div><div><br/></div><div>today he also stated his belief that cell phones cause brain cancer because of radio waves, wi-fi, and bluetooth signals. I thought that was a myth that was debunked years ago, and brought up the fact that such signals are always in the air whether you&apos;re holding a phone up to your head or not. he claims that there&apos;s plenty of writing out there supporting his belief, without mentioning any explicit sources. just to humor myself, when I got back to my desk I googled &quot;do cell phones cause cancer&quot; and the results all indicated no or maybe.</div><div><br/></div><div>he had to replace a battery in his phone, mentioning that it&apos;s much cheaper to just get a new battery than a new $700 phone, that no one needs a $700 phone, and before I knew it I was participating in another bland &quot;no one needsanything&quot; conversation. I doubt he would believe any argument that a smartphone can very much be a necessity now.</div><div><br/></div><div>I also decided to vent to him (not that I have many outlets to pick from) about DOOGIE&apos;s passive aggressive response to my going up to south carolina to see the eclipse. initially he didn&apos;t even acknowledge what I said as he looked down at his phone, and I started wondering if he didn&apos;t like what I&apos;d said. but then he brought it back up as our food came, and I achieved my cathartic release. he took my side and I felt my attitude towards him improve immediately.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>8-16 w</div><div><br/></div><div>I have no idea what I did on weekends when I was still in school. these days I waste afternoons and days just barely keeping myself preoccupied with mental junk.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>8-20 n</div><div><br/></div><div>the CRC reopened last week. on thursday christian swung by the CRB first, so we went together again. on friday, I&apos;d assumed we&apos;d be going separately, so I walked over there while, I presumed, he was heading to his car to drive. I don&apos;t know where he initially went, but when he arrived 15 minutes later than I did, he looked pissed and it took me a moment to realize that he had been waiting somewhere for me. apparently he took our very brief conversation the day before, about me meeting him midway, as the plan, even though I never confirmed that I&apos;d be waiting for him anywhere, and he never told or asked me about where he apparently expected to meet up with me. it was kind of unbelievable. then he forgave me, telling me it&apos;s alright before I even realized what he had been thinking.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>currently I&apos;m sitting on a bed in someone&apos;s house in greenville, south carolina. I stopped at the i love pho in that plaza, the one I visited with steph and david, and again with Kat. I hadn&apos;t been in the area since 2015. the rest of the 150-mile drive was uneventful.</div><div><br/></div><div>I found the street and house, that I had looked at several times in google street view, in real life. a modest little single story home (though it turns out the owner has multiple places on this street). I tentatively walked up the little path leading to the front door and rang the doorbell. I heard talking inside and a man named Ryan greeted me. I&apos;m not sure what his ethnicity is. mixed, middle eastern? on the opposite side of the house at the kitchen table sat a woman (I think her name is Nancy), and the host, Mei, was in the kitchen. I mistook Nancy for Mei initially and was confused. the presence of another guest was already unexpected, but not unpleasantly or anything.</div><div><br/></div><div>I still don&apos;t know what</div><div><br/></div><div>the house is small but completely packed with tchotchkes. every corner, surface, sill, shelf, covered in objects. the walls covered in framed artworks. this isn&apos;t meant to be a criticism. I can only try to wonder what the stories are behind the hundreds, thousands, of little things collected over the years.</div><div><br/></div><div>I sat down at the table and began adapting to these new surroundings. Mei continued to prepare food in the small but filled from floor to ceiling with spices, cookware, and dinnerware. Nancy talked the most and was older than me and Ryan. I think I sensed a little bit of her recalling her personal history as she told us about her life, the places she moved and lived in and when. that history that&apos;s different for everyone, that inherently cannot ever be truly shared with anyone. she mentioned a place nearby that could serve as a potential eclipse viewing ground. seeing as how I didn&apos;t anticipate anyone else to be here, I wouldn&apos;t mind if I ended up watching it with her. I know if I had known ahead of time that there&apos;d be other guests, I would have envisioned a pretty girl my age who I just happen to hit it off with.</div><div><br/></div><div>the food turned out to be our dinner. Mei had made five different dishes. three of them, cucumber, radish, and eggplant, I barely or didn&apos;t touch, but I ate some cauliflower/green pepper/bacon and tomato/egg. another guest, named John, joined us in the middle. John and Nancy had both come from somewhere in maryland.</div><div><br/></div><div>after we finished eating we mostly sat and listened as Mei talked extensively, mostly about cooking and food culture differences between here and china. how american fast food chains are so much fancier and formal over there. how there are so many inauthentic, crap chinese restaurants here. it&apos;s clear she&apos;s had a lot of experiences to draw from, and I was reminded of that reason, why I feel I have nothing to offer anyone. no stories.</div><div><br/></div><div>if the weather permits, I&apos;ll see an astronomical phenomenon tomorrow afternoon, and be back in atlanta in the evening.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>8-22 t</div><div><br/></div><div>the horrendous, next-level traffic on the way back yesterday was probably the major reason that the day felt so long, but another reason would be that I was in a new place. I had a hard time falling asleep, with my airbnb hosts still talking and light leaking in from underneath the door. I don&apos;t remember slipping away and it was quiet and dark when I suddenly came to. I made a lot of trips to the bathroom because I kept drinking water trying to soothe my irritated throat.</div><div><br/></div><div>I woke up early in the morning with nothing to do so I kept browsing the solareclipse subreddit and continuously checked the weather conditions. the other guests had no plans to do any eclipse watching with one another. I don&apos;t know when they left, but they were gone by the time I came back from the waffle house I had stopped by last august. I was the only one left now wandering around the house waiting for the total eclipse to come. I realized that the host Ryan wasn&apos;t even really anticipating the eclipse at all. I lent him my eclipse glasses at the start of the partial and he seemed so taken aback. then, somehow he got on board with seeing the total eclipse and called up a friend of his, who he said lived in a good place to view it. in between doing housework to prepare for future guests, and while I kept walking in and out of the house to stare up at the sky for a few seconds. the moon covered a bit more of the sun each time.</div><div><br/></div><div>I don&apos;t know what I would have done if he hadn&apos;t called his friend, where I would have gone and ended up watching it. I followed him to a gated neighborhood, nearly losing him at a couple yellow lights; don&apos;t know what would have happened had we gotten separated). this was now 20 minutes or so before totality and the light was getting noticeably dimmer now. it was almost unbelievable that it was actually happening.</div><div><br/></div><div>the neighborhood was up on a hill. there were a few families gathered outside in a small parking lot by what looked like an apartment building. I pulled in one right by the slope of the hill. some buildings and a bit of a horizon were visible in the distance. one family with a few small kids were also standing around there. a few minutes before the shadow hit, I noticed the crescent-shaped shadows cast on the ground by the leaves. propped my phone on the ground to take a video of what it looked like rapidly getting dark, and light again. dashed to my car to get the binoculars I almost forgot about. it got colder. I kept talking to Ryan. I felt like a child.</div><div><br/></div><div>when totality hit I think I realized that i couldn&apos;t see anything through my glasses anymore, and looked up at the sky and finally saw it for myself. there had been some clouds in the distance, but the sky surrounding the sun was completely clear. it got dark rapidly, and everything felt really quiet. the ring of light floated silently in the sky. I kept looking through the binoculars but I think I was slightly trembling. Ryan was completely awestruck (&quot;oh, shit...&quot;). I wasted maybe 10-15 seconds seeing if I could get a photo of it with my phone.</div><div><br/></div><div>I think I missed the first diamond ring and bailey&apos;s beads, but got to see the second ones after the shortest two minutes ever. it was so spectacularly perfectly bright and round. and then just like that, the spectacle was over as it got bright again very quickly. I like to think that Ryan was quite glad he decided to watch (&quot;really makes you think&quot;). he asked me if he could keep the eclipse glasses I lent him, and I said yes. I wonder if it will be added to the house&apos;s collection of items. he left more or less immediately after, and I only stayed for another minute or two.</div><div><br/></div><div>what makes me a little bit sad is that I didn&apos;t feel a huge emotional response to the event, but regardless, it went better than I thought it ever could, I came and saw what I set out to see, and I have no regrets at all.</div><div><br/></div><div>except for deciding to leave at the same time as however many millions of people, taking three times as long to get back to atlanta as it did to come to south carolina. I was dreadfully sick the entire time and kept texting my mom about it. there was no one else who would care.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>I met with my brother&apos;s friend Winston to return to him the stuff he&apos;d asked me to hold on, and ended up giving him a ride from the CoC to crecine. an entire block of west campus had changed drastically since I saw it last year when I helped alice pack up her things. speaking of alice, I just realized that she&apos;s starting her third year at tech. her third year.</div><div><br/></div><div>winston and I had what felt like a normal conversation to me. he asked me if I had ever done any research while I was a student, and I had no experience to draw on.</div><div><br/></div><div>tonight I vented to Tracy about DOOGIE&apos;s ridiculous behavior towards me and my eclipse trip. he&apos;s twice brought up the fact that I didn&apos;t take any pictures of the event. it feels like he doesn&apos;t like that I enjoyed the trip.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>8-24 r</div><div><br/></div><div>last night I ran into the old man again in the parking garage, and forgot everything I had rehearsed to myself. also I just don&apos;t have it in me to be mean or rude without significant provocation. I started thinking that he could possibly be genuinely trying to be nice, but I don&apos;t want to assume so and leave it at that. all of this is still a waste of emotional energy, really.</div><div><br/></div><div>last week I could hear the girl next door to me having sex with someone again. I might have heard her orgasm. it affected me the same as last time, then faded the same way, before spinning off into darkness again.</div><div><br/></div><div>christian picked me up on ferst dr on his way to the gym. he almost seems to really want to for some reason, even though it makes so much more sense to me for me to just walk and meet him there. when I get in he&apos;s listening to metal on the radio, not turning it off this time. I say hey and he goes, &quot;what&apos;s up.&quot; it&apos;s almost &quot;cute&quot; in that I get the vibe that he&apos;s consciously being normal. but that could always just be me. I managed 205 lbs on the bench yesterday, and texted DOOGIE about it just to see how he&apos;d respond.</div><div><br/></div><div>christian also wants me to get destiny 2 and I honestly do get the feeling that he thinks of me as a friend now, and has been. he&apos;s told me some more personal stuff about his girlfriend. I&apos;m presuming girlfriend. I don&apos;t think he&apos;s ever actually used that term when referring to her.</div><div><br/></div><div>today, while waiting in line at the chick fil-a drive thru again, he once more told me that I should try talking to some of girls who work there. reiterated that they ask me about when he goes and I&apos;m not with him. I&apos;m not sure I believe that. he also didn&apos;t specify who exactly. &quot;you never know,&quot; though.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m just three weeks away from 25.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">8-1 w</span></div><div><br/></div><div>my parents seemed to not expect me to come to the airport to pick them up? mom said it was a surprise. she never told me when they got on the plane, but that was because she&apos;d accidentally texted dad instead. I was happy to see them, but that quickly crumbled under the anxiety of reintroducing them to my space again. even though I&apos;d already been anticipating it, it&apos;s still a hard blow. I feel like I have nothing to do when they&apos;re here. because normally, all I would be doing is sitting in front of the computer, eternally killing time. but when they&apos;re sitting behind me, I suddenly can&apos;t do anything.</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s depressing how big an effect even these minor routine disruptions are having on me. I&apos;m in a flatly negative mood right now. and Blessed called me out for skipping the dev-standup meeting this morning, which really left a sour taste in my mouth and further worsened my mood.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;ve been imagining trying to explain my feelings to the crew, and I don&apos;t see it happening fulfilling-ly.</div><div><br/></div><div>Jay&apos;s birthday was yesterday and a bunch of people wished him happy birthday in the message group. I wonder if we&apos;ll go through with his &quot;birthday stuff&quot; in a future hangout, and subsequently if there&apos;s any hope for me to have a social birthday this year.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>I have misgivings about petunia, but I tried pushing some of them aside today as I actually met up with him for lunch at a &quot;burger bar&quot;. he&apos;s still been rather prying and direct, asking me (on messenger) what street I live on (I gave him one closer to my workplace), pushing for me to get a beer, pushing for me to spend time at his house? and he actually went in and hugged me twice, even pulling the &quot;I&apos;m a hugger&quot; line. the second one was uncomfortably snug.&nbsp;&nbsp;the whole time I was paranoid that he somehow slipped something in my food. he spoke somewhat slowly and his voice was softer than I thought it&apos;d be. I withheld a lot of my conversation because I didn&apos;t feel comfortable. at one point he said something about making me a bracelet after trying to put a couple of his on my wrist, claiming it was to test out the sizing. I feel extremely weird about the whole thing. he remembered the color of my car from a photo of an ugly car I had sent him that I had taken from inside my own car. I feel silly for spilling so much of my personal shit to him now.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">8-6 m</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>losing track of the days and whatever&apos;s happened since my parents came down to visit. they&apos;re leaving tomorrow. I can&apos;t remember much of what we did during the second half of last week. they&apos;ve only spent two nights at my place; I&apos;ve been chauffeuring them to and from their hotels on the other days. the sad thing is that the increased anxiety from the part of me that views their presence as an invasion on my space means I&apos;m partially looking forward to their leaving, so that I&apos;ll be alone again. consequently I haven&apos;t been able to enjoy their company as much I would if I were the one to have gone home instead.</div><div><br/></div><div>much of the work we&apos;d been planning to do, specifically for the floors and windows, wasn&apos;t done, because I wasn&apos;t willing to spend the money. the weekdays have been spent separately, because I&apos;m sitting at my office computer all day getting no work done, before rejoining them in the evenings. my mom has been doing a lot of cooking and cleaning and I catch myself avoiding thinking about her being gone.</div><div><br/></div><div>on saturday I ran the usual route in piedmont park and took my parents on a walk throughout it. I bought a cup of iced coffee from the farmer&apos;s market there. then we spent much of the afternoon up in cumming, looking at places to potentially buy a new house. I walked around some extravagant, large homes. it was easy to fall into a spell, daydreaming about owning such a place. we had dinner at the chinese restaurant that used to be called liu fu, then visited the investment house that my parents had bought years ago, that I hadn&apos;t been to for slightly fewer years.</div><div><br/></div><div>on sunday we went to stone mountain and hiked up the walk-up trail to the top. it was the first time I&apos;d been to stone mountain since 2014. I wanted to get a picture of myself, but didn&apos;t. I ended up in some random kids&apos; video and didn&apos;t think to make a funny face. we bought some snacks and the total was $7.01; my dad had no change and my mom had a quarter, and I thought to search the floor for change and actually found a penny. we took the sky ride instead of walking back down. lunch was at the tofu soup restaurant. after that we did some quick shopping at target, where I saw a guy dressed in gaudy gucci sweatpants and shoes.</div><div><br/></div><div>that about covers what I can think of. the weekend felt significantly longer than usual, which is known to be due to new events, so it&apos;s rare. I predict that, despite the current stress, I&apos;ll be briefly melancholy when my apartment is quiet and still again after my parents leave, before slipping back into my routine. if I want things to change, I&apos;m going to have to carefully deconstruct the routine. time somehow whirls by when all I do all day is look for ways to pass it. I&apos;ll have to eliminate something.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m not sure what Anthony was telling me earlier today about the fix to the android code that I&apos;d made on friday, but I have an inkling that it was positive. this morning, Blessed claims to recognize that I must have a new girlfriend because apparently I always seem happy when I come into work.</div><div><br/></div><div>I think it was as I was laying in bed last night that I realized I can count the number of times I&apos;ve met up with nita on my fingers. communication with her has been sparse. I may be watching an infantile friendship falling apart.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">8-10 f</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>I was able to trust my gut on a minor decision I made at the &quot;sushi lounge&quot; I went to for lunch with the coworkers yesterday. the manhattan roll was quite good and is the second time I&apos;ve tried sushi and liked what I tasted.</div><div><br/></div><div>today I met the Ben&apos;s wife. I think her name is Kara? she was shorter than I expected. for some reason. we talked for a little bit as Ben was ordering food at stationside after I ordered my own food and complimented the cashier girl&apos;s glasses. I&apos;m sure she recognizes me by now. Ben says that I tend to not &quot;participate&quot; in things at the office, and I wasn&apos;t entirely sure what he meant. conversations? Kara said I was fine just then as we were talking. I hope she meant it. I was relaxed and mostly at ease as I chatted with the two of them until their food was ready.</div><div><br/></div><div>later in the afternoon bordering on evening, Ben and Zach were the only others in the office and we talked for a bit about our development experiences and how smart the Blessed and Anthony are. why was I was surprised to hear that? Ben brought up that Blessed is very confident in his skills, whereas he (and I) was not.</div><div><br/></div><div>the cuban restaurant Dorothy had suggested was not the place I&apos;d thought it was (the one where I got the crab cake sandwich and laughed with the Andrew about Zach). Cody&apos;s workplace is barely a block away and he directed us to park all of our cars in his workplace parking lot, which was behind some buildings with a lot of gravel and cobblestone around. my focus went again towards staying as chipper and true to myself as I could. I hadn&apos;t seen the rest of them in several weeks. Dorothy and Heather recalled stories from their trip to miami, which was nothing to me as I wasn&apos;t present. they mentioned David hitting on women, and I didn&apos;t like the reminder that he&apos;s ahead of me there. there was more gossiping about him going on some date with Tia, and planning to meet with Hannah for lunch (again). the mojitos were strong and the initial taste brought barcelona back again. Barb wore a dress that showed a lot of cleavage and I noticed her and Cody getting closer and closer. I also noticed Jay stayed fairly quiet for most of the dinner. David seemingly began getting carried away explaining an idea for a healthcare-related app, interested in working on it with some of us. when we left, Cody and Barb walked off ahead on their own, after which the rest of us immediately began speaking in hushed tones about them. I still have no emotional attachment to Barb, but my previous assessment of their chances may be wrong. it&apos;s pretty clear that she&apos;d totally sleep with him if he ever reciprocates. I just kept reminding myself that their time isn&apos;t mine, and if mine ever comes, it&apos;ll arrive separately.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">8-12 n</span></div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s times like these that I wonder what it is that&apos;s going on in my head when I&apos;m NOT feeling this anxious. how is it that I can feel okay, that my mind can be at rest, as long as I&apos;m aware that I&apos;m nearing 26 and have always been alone? missing out on all of the relationship stages that normal adults go through, that can&apos;t ever be revisited. I&apos;m afraid of dying in a plane crash because of this.</div><div><br/></div><div>I wonder what it&apos;s like to be someone like Barb, to have so many people devote so much attention to you even when you aren&apos;t there. it hadn&apos;t even been a full day, and I felt like I&apos;d heard Dorothy talking about Barb&apos;s cleavage-showing dress a million times. so everyone else is aware too, by the way. how could I ever have thought otherwise?</div><div><br/></div><div>cody and I parked on myrtle st at the same time, and to my surprise he suggested that we run &quot;in sync&quot; together. this meant it was easier on me because my pace is slightly faster than his. he took off his shirt after I took off mine. we sat alone together at jason&apos;s deli; he&apos;d picked a separate table instead of joining the rest of the running meetup group.</div><div><br/></div><div>Dorothy was the only one who&apos;d been voicing any interest at all in me hosting a party at my place (cody suggested she just wanted someone else to host something). I kept waiting for other people to suggest it instead of taking more initiative myself. I even allowed her to message the invite to my place to everyone in the messenger group, instead of doing that myself; in fact it was what I&apos;d been hoping for, so I wouldn&apos;t have to do it. I tentatively threw out a time, and as the time drew near, people began asking me where they&apos;d be allowed to park. I gave more tentative, rather than firm, answers. I noticed that Barb was absent from it all.</div><div><br/></div><div>the order of arrival was: cody, Dorothy, Jay. then Heather, Tia, David? for the first half, Dorothy once again dominated the conversation with endless discussion on Barb&apos;s dress and David&apos;s hawaiian mistake (apparently he&apos;d gotten involved with a crazy woman who ended up costing him some $25,000 in ways before he could get rid of her). asking about what happened between Barb and cody the night before. giving cody more attention than she does to me or Jay, who stayed relatively silent again. every time cody describes what he&apos;d like from a committed relationship, Dorothy melts.</div><div><br/></div><div>it was surreal seeing so many of them inside my space. they weren&apos;t unwelcome, but they looked out of place here. they didn&apos;t belong here. but they had no problem being here. this place had never been so lively. I stood around my own kitchen, which became crowded, while Dorothy cooked the ramen she brought. people took turns frying eggs. it got messy quickly and I had to hold it all in. one pleasant surprise was how much everyone loved my mother&apos;s dumplings. Tia even went so far as to say that she didn&apos;t believe my mom actually made them. because I was in my high-alert mode, I didn&apos;t have much of an appetite and didn&apos;t eat as much as the others.</div><div><br/></div><div>to be honest I was hoping for some more reactions to the stuff I had, but I guess that&apos;s what I get. I had moved the lego millennium falcon onto my dresser to display it, but no one seemed to see it at all. later in the night there was a little bit of talk about my computer, but I didn&apos;t gauge that much interest. I think I failed again here, because I&apos;ve a feeling that if cody were in my shoes, he&apos;d have gone to town talking about it like he does his paintings. maybe I&apos;m a little bit too humble. I did show off a smart light switch by remotely adjusting the living room lights as Dorothy used my selfie stick to take a picture of the group (again, I handed it to her instead of taking one myself. I wonder if she&apos;ll be talking about this to other people later). the photo was taken on my phone, and before I sent it to the messenger group, I edited it to scribble horns on everyone&apos;s heads, inspired by what petunia had done to a photo of myself that I&apos;d sent him. Jay found it hilarious, and he and I looked at each other, he laughing and I smiling.</div><div><br/></div><div>Dorothy told me a couple times that I have a good make-out pad. if dreams come true, that&apos;ll come to fruition soon. as I&apos;d been planning, I left the silent hill ambience video playing on youtube, which got David&apos;s attention. earlier in the kitchen, he and Tia once again pointed to my dry sense of humor. it was nice to receive that rare validation. even cody agreed.</div><div><br/></div><div>Tia and David left first. for the remainder of the night we looked up various music suggestions, mostly from Cody after I clicked on a video of the type of music he likes after the silent hill music ended. out of the blue Dorothy wanted to get a pizza, but Cody just wanted to go home and of course no one would be interested in staying when I&apos;m sitting there playing L4D2 after &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE sent me a late night invite.</div><div><br/></div><div>somehow strange to think that this was the sort of thing that, as I said to ROdNEY, I&apos;d only ever dreamt of happening. and now, as all things do, it&apos;s simply come and gone.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">8-13 m</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>something embarrassing that happened twice during my &quot;party&quot; was being asked what I eat, because I have so little food to cook with in my fridge and kitchen that they were wondering. I skirted around the question, giving a straight answer.</div><div><br/></div><div>if facebook&apos;s &quot;memories&quot; are accurate, then I created my account there 11 years ago yesterday.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">8-14 t</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>the Mallory was back at the jiu jitsu gym today. I saw Hannah for the first time in a couple weeks, but didn&apos;t say much to her. Jacob rolls with Mallory quite effortlessly. I remain uncertain about any future in this sport, as I&apos;m not seriously invested in it at all.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">8-17 f</span></div><div><br/></div><div>my inability to explain things is really shining now that the Gorm has effectively tasked me with explaining the groovy scripts I&apos;ve been working on to Ben. I don&apos;t know why he wants Ben to look at them with me, considering he doesn&apos;t even work with java and barely knows it. I know that being unable to explain something to someone usually indicates a lack of understanding it myself, and that&apos;s partially true. Ben&apos;s personality is, I think, similar to mine. a few times, after he sat down next to me, we started talking about other things and just let each other go off. it felt a little like being in college again. hating on Kumar and musing about Zach&apos;s confusing mannerisms. I realized that even though Ben knew nothing about this material, I was the one who kept waiting for him to take the lead.</div><div><br/></div><div>then I received a surprise in the form of Nita messaging me, inviting me to go see wong fu later in the evening. apparently they were touring and had stopped in atlanta. I was glad she&apos;d thought of me, but she mentioned that several members of that asian meetup group weren&apos;t going, so maybe she had originally only planned to go with some of them? the venue was located in that plaza by the trader joe&apos;s, a place I hadn&apos;t been to in nearly four years. the last visit was at the bar called &apos;the independent&apos;, with a meetup group with the Angie.</div><div><br/></div><div>I found the theater and stood around inside, feeling the familiar Anxiety once again, clinging on to the saving grace that was Nita. she arrived with her brother? it took me a moment to recognize him. it was the first time seeing her in four months. we had an awkward hug that took me a second because I had my arms crossed. her brother, Richard I think, started talking to me in the bathroom. I paid attention to him and his body language. he had his arms hanging down with his hands in his pockets or belt loops. I thought that was stupid. I wanted him to be, but he wasn&apos;t, and actually took some charge as he struck up a conversation with someone else in line about their shirt. this tiny girl, a Ling, was standing with us. Nita and Richard talked with her while I stood there saying nothing. some wong fu members walked around scanning people&apos;s tickets. Nita excitedly pointed them out, but I had no idea who they were. there were a lot of asians present, obviously, some of them taking pictures and videos.</div><div><br/></div><div>it was a somewhat sad, decrepit-looking theater/auditorium area. old, sticky floors, dim lighting, cold. Nita wanted to talk to another of the wong fu members but was too shy. she was starstruck while I barely had a clue who I was seeing. she also told me I should talk to Ling, telling me that she was checking me out earlier. I seriously doubt that because the Ling mentioned her husband very shortly after, so I don&apos;t know why Nita would say something like that.</div><div><br/></div><div>while the wong fu Philip was at the front speaking to the audience, Nita and her brother kept whooping and yelling, and calling out. Nita watched some of it through her phone, streaming live on facebook for a few minutes more than once. what was the point?</div><div><br/></div><div>the feature presentation was a showing of all five episodes of their latest show/story, which kept me engaged and afterwards had me thinking about the asian part of my...identity? that I had all but forgotten long ago. after some q&amp;a time they prepared the meet/greet for the people who&apos;d bought vip tickets. Nita wanted to see them, but I gave her another shitty hug and just left.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>recurring thoughts:</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m suddenly hearing about the movie &apos;crazy rich asians&apos; everywhere, and Dorothy rhetorically asked me, &quot;aren&apos;t you one of them?&quot; so add her to the list of people who&apos;ve made some comment on how much money I must have.</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s been over four years since what I consider to be the beginning of my adult life. about a week or so it occurred to me that in another four years, I&apos;ll be 30. that&apos;s one of the most shocking things I&apos;ve realized recently.</div><div>interesting how Cody also described my bedroom as &quot;where the magic happens.&quot; twice. I&apos;m sure it&apos;s just a stock phrase that people default to.</div><div><br/></div><div>the discussion on David&apos;s height, at my party after he left. I remember hearing them say that the best way for a man to compensate for short stature is wealth.</div><div><br/></div><div>the red pill concept of &quot;frame&quot;. I&apos;ve identified instances in the past where mine has failed. getting teased about skipping parts of the road race because my time wasn&apos;t posted. Ben getting on my nerves (he doesn&apos;t anymore, usually). what happens is I become aware of how ugly my facial expression must look. while at the same time trying to play it cool. it doesn&apos;t work, and people can tell.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;ll be 26 in four weeks, which will be the oldest I&apos;ve ever been and youngest I&apos;ll ever be. I always feel like I&apos;m hurtling uncontrollably toward some precipice, like there&apos;s a hard cutoff that I can do nothing to postpone, after which everything will be over. that shouldn&apos;t be the case, but I will forever be filled with wistfulness when thinking back to the past times that ALL felt right on the edge. only to all end up themselves buried safely underneath layers of time. in the present, I always feel like I&apos;m closing in on the end.</div><div><br/></div><div>I invited cody to have some empanadas again for dinner today, but he posted in the messenger group. now, Dorothy and Barb at least are dragging themselves into this.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">8-19 n</span></div><div><br/></div><div>Nita had asked me to record a video of the wong fu guys for her, as her phone had apparently died. I uploaded it to facebook the next day, but she didn&apos;t even acknowledge it. I think my relationship with her is coming to a close. there&apos;s nothing we can do for each other anymore. I would be surprised if we see each other even once for the rest of this year.</div><div><br/></div><div>dinner at papi&apos;s for the second friday in a row. cody showed me around his workplace, converted from a big old house. I met one of his coworkers, a Lina. they mostly talked amongst themselves about their work. she was 34 but I thought she looked older. Dorothy came next, then Barb and her sister Karen, visiting from france. she&apos;s a little bigger than Barb but is two years younger. looked kind of like the stranger things barb. I was a little drunk from the mojitos again. they somehow recognized my OCD tendencies when they came over to my place last weekend, but I let them know they were welcome to come back. Tia arrived in a dress, having just gone on a date where she had little to eat because she didn&apos;t want her date to think she eats too much. so she ate the half of my sandwich I didn&apos;t want. not even the sandwich, just the chicken inside and one slice of tomato. I think she didn&apos;t notice the second slice of tomato. she&apos;s been going on many dates with guys she meets online. David arrived after we had mostly finished eating so he waited for us to pay and then invited us to go over to his place.</div><div><br/></div><div>I noticed cody and Barb with their arms around each other a couple times. his around her shoulder, hers around his waist. somehow they all didn&apos;t realize that Dorothy was still in the bathroom so we waited at the corner after crossing the street. maybe Barb was feeling it from her margarita or whatever she drank, as she suddenly went around giving people a hug. I said, &quot;how&apos;ve you been, Barb?&quot; but I wish I&apos;d gone with the long-rehearsed &quot;you&apos;re so sweet&quot; that I have yet to say to anybody.</div><div><br/></div><div>David&apos;s apartment was just a short walk away. I felt very different walking along the streets this time from how I felt last time. I spoke little to Karen as a bunch of us gathered out on the balcony. David shared some wine with us. cody and Barb continued Bonding on David&apos;s couch, before moving into his bedroom with the oft-referenced purple bed. David shut the door for them, and there was much speculation the next day, primarily from Dorothy, as to what might have occurred within. it didn&apos;t really bother me. I moved toward David, Tia, and Dorothy, forgetting about Karen now that I think about. David and Tia were having a philosophical discussion that I was somewhat interested in, but couldn&apos;t connect with. I kept playing with Tia&apos;s watch and ring. at around 11:30 we got up and left. I drove Tia to her building, the element, and still had enough in my system to fairly easily converse with her. she was surprised when I told her I used to drive a camaro (never got to mention the crash) and she described me as being like an onion, with multiple layers to peel away. I dropped her off and waited by the side of the street until she went inside. later, she sent a message thanking me for doing so and we wished each other good night.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>the next day cody made good on his promise to go on a &quot;bird journey&quot;. Dorothy made it down here too, and we all rode birds together. Dorothy had never ridden any kind of scooter before, motorized or not, and I found her to be rather hesitant and kept looking for guidance. she really thought that she needed to kick off exactly three times every time to get going. unfortunately cody&apos;s bird had a flat tire and every other one we found parked somewhere also had some issue with it. he also wasted several dollars starting rides with scooters that turned out to be broken. I&apos;d have been upset if that were me. and so we didn&apos;t get to ride for as long as I&apos;d have liked.</div><div><br/></div><div>the day continued with Dorothy and Heather at the atlantic station regal, where we saw the movie I&apos;d been hearing so much about, &apos;crazy rich asians&apos;. as I&apos;ve said to a couple people already, I could not relate to the movie on any level. I became slightly emotional at parts, which I quickly turned off. we met at pijiu belly afterwards with David, and Tia appeared with a friend of hers. I was being judgmental of him and had to turn that around. David became a little defensive against something someone said about him being a player. Heather seemingly placated him by commending his respect of people&apos;s boundaries after they make it known that they aren&apos;t interested in him. I would be depressed if I were in a position where someone could say that about me. it would mean having to experience rejection within a group multiple times. and I don&apos;t remember how the conversation flowed, but when I said that I&apos;m afraid of being the boring person on a date, Dorothy reassured me that I&apos;m interesting. it felt good to hear, but she never elaborated.</div><div><br/></div><div>I was the first to arrive at our next stop, monday night garage, revisiting for the first time. an asian guy just happened to catch my eye as I circled the parking lot, and before I could walk into the place with David and Heather, he walked up to me and asked, in a somewhat apologetic way, if I had jumper cables with me. and of course I thought about how I had helped a neighbor jump start their car just two weeks ago, and agreed to help him. but I was still uncertain about the order to connect the cables, and he asked the girl in his car to look it up. I found myself leading the way just a little bit more naturally. at the end of it, he introduced himself as Ian, and insisted that I take some money he offered me. I could have handled that a little better, giving him back only 5 of the 10 dollars (plus a $1 he accidentally put in there?). so I did accept something, but I&apos;m not sure if I should have. I feel like he might not have entirely known what he was doing either.</div><div><br/></div><div>as I sat at a table with Dorothy et al., she whispered to us that cody had seen a facebook update about his ex that showed her kissing someone else. that would explain why he told me he needed to get out of his house so badly. it hasn&apos;t even been a day and I feel like I&apos;ve heard this a thousand times. he arrived separately from the rest of us, and told us himself what Dorothy had just told us all. he was clearly emotional (understandably so), and kept repeating things about quitting social media, and why should he give a fuck what people post on there, and so on. he almost seemed drunk, but hadn&apos;t had anything to drink. one thing he said about me, that made me feel good, was that he&apos;s noticed a positive change in me, namely that I come hang out more than I used to, instead of staying inside playing video games.</div><div><br/></div><div>Dorothy kept talking about cody and Barb in David&apos;s bedroom on his purple bed last night. and wouldn&apos;t shut up about how flirtatious Barb continues to be towards cody. cody did admit that he touched her ass last night. maybe she&apos;s breaking down his barriers after all. the rest of them engaged in talk regarding various aspects of relationships. Jay drove himself all the way from wherever he lives to join us. I eventually just sat and watched the third harry potter movie that was being projected on repeat. a short distance away from us, a skinny guy cuddled with an asian girl who kind of looked like alice.</div><div><br/></div><div>it was cody who suggested inviting Barb and her sister down with the rest of us, so Jay took it upon himself to message them. some time later, I was standing by the food truck and didn&apos;t notice them until Barb pinched my elbow or something. I felt happy that she was comfortable enough to give me a hug. her sister, too, but I never said anything to her again after that.</div><div><br/></div><div>even before they got here, I&apos;d already been sitting around for longer than I&apos;d planned, so I was ready to leave. David, Heather, and Dorothy took off at once, but I sat with the rest of them until I finished the glass of beer I had. cody and Barb were facing each other, talking, and I heard her say to him that she hates seeing him this way, because she too could tell that he was feeling down. I got up to leave and say good-bye. Barb asked what they&apos;re going to do without me, and I said that that&apos;s for them to figure out.</div><div><br/></div><div>only to find that the other three were still talking in the parking lot. I happily stayed and talked with them. about Tia. but David had heard my &quot;I could use some&quot; quip when they referred to their talking as a therapy session, and asked me what was going on. so I timidly mentioned again that I had never been in a relationship, but once again failed to fully articulate my worries. Dorothy once again said that I was young, and told me that I just haven&apos;t met a girl who realizes how good I am. or something like that. did she mean that? when I said that it&apos;s not normal for a 26-year-old to have never been in a relationship, she dismissed the concern and said to not worry about being normal. I think I was thirsting too much for the reassuring words, and didn&apos;t follow up with more details on how I truly felt. and now I might not get that opportunity again. furthermore I don&apos;t know how much I can trust Dorothy&apos;s feelings about it. Heather was kind enough to give me some suggestions as to where to look, but I didn&apos;t know what to say, and merely smiled and nodded like an idiot. I don&apos;t think I even thanked her.</div><div><br/></div><div>this early afternoon I went on a hike with cody at the paces mill trail, the same place we went to last november, the day after the day I met Barb for the first time. I was happy that he was willing to spend the time with just me (although I think he had initially invited Dorothy too). I didn&apos;t always have something to say in response to the things he said to me, and frequently had trouble finding the best words. but I was able to relate to him on some things, such as the need to expand our social circles, because the current crew is all but maxed out. he continued reiterating his feelings about his ex, and I didn&apos;t always have a response for him. at one point he asked me about what I want in a relationship, and what I need to do to get it. and it felt strange talking about myself. I&apos;m still too caught up in worry about what people think of me, still too afraid that people don&apos;t enjoy my company and actively want me gone.</div><div><br/></div><div>after I left monday night garage last night, Barb must have mentioned to Cody that she was going to float down the river here today with her Mac and sister. when the two of us reached a point on the trial by the edge of the water, we coincidentally waited just long enough for their inflatable raft to float into view. he spotted Karen&apos;s red hair first, and as we stared at them, we saw them looking back at us, and it actually turned out to be them. they floated towards us and we talked for a bit. I wondered if the Mac knows about how Barb feels toward cody, if he has any idea how much she likes him. what&apos;s going through all of their heads? I wouldn&apos;t want to be Mac right now, but the nature of the position he&apos;s in entails that I wouldn&apos;t even know it if I were.</div><div><br/></div><div>missed another opportunity to tell someone how I feel. the only time I was the focus was when cody explicitly asked me what it was like living far away from my parents and family. he said a lot of mhm&apos;s and uh-huh&apos;s as I answered, just like I do when I&apos;m the listener. we got lunch from another grub burger bar location. who knew I&apos;d be at one of those again so soon? it was right next to chuy&apos;s, the shitty tex mex restaurant we ate at the last time we were here, nine months ago. the final thing cody and I bonded on was the experience of being excited for a trip or vacation only when embarking on one with a person who&apos;s special to you. going it alone or with family just isn&apos;t the same. I haven&apos;t ever had such an experience.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">8-22 w</span></div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday was one year since I saw the eclipse and I didn&apos;t even write anything about that. in fact I had hardly been thinking about it at all. the anticipation of anniversaries is basically completely gone. and it&apos;s only (!) been four years. can you imagine this, moving forward?</div><div><br/></div><div>something David said sometime last weekend, that I again didn&apos;t speak up to, was that it&apos;s better to have never loved than to have loved and lost. an inverse of the classic saying. I keep missing these opportunities to make my own problems known for once. Cody mentioned on our hike on sunday that he had seemed &quot;broken&quot; on saturday. I had noticed that myself. that the low, broken chair he was sitting on made him seem smaller still. so I believe his sentiment is born out of some bad relationship experiences.</div><div><br/></div><div>whatever it is that cody&apos;s going through, it&apos;s something I can barely relate to, if at all. he&apos;s been on the fence about going &quot;off the grid&quot; for days now, while repeatedly spouting well-known, tired mantras concerning the negatives of social media. wondering out loud why he looks for things on facebook that he knows will hurt him. over and over. I&apos;d like to be able to help him, maybe be someone he can talk to if he wants, but at the same time it hurts to know that I&apos;ve never really even had the chance to deal with the same problem. his behavior indicates hesitance towards doing what it takes to move on, like closing a door forever, or something. some stage of grief I have yet to experience.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">8-23 r</span></div><div><br/></div><div>everyone refers to our thursday group lunch as &quot;get up and go&quot;. on the way there in the Rashida&apos;s truck, Blessed told us that the reason he was late to work yesterday was because he got pulled over and given a ticket for using his phone in his car...and he was on his phone to message the dev-standup channel that he would be late. that&apos;s some bs, and when he told everyone else at the table, no one showed any sympathy. Ben even laughed, although it was directed towards the irony of the situation rather than Blessed&apos;s misfortune. this has taught me to never expect sympathy from anyone whenever I find myself in an unfortunate situation.</div><div><br/></div><div>I learned that the Robbie is only 24 years old; I had thought he was in his early 30&apos;s (but didn&apos;t say so out loud). everyone remarked on how quiet he is. I don&apos;t know what he does. I do see him pack up and leave for lunch with his backpack. maybe he&apos;s lonely or something. it&apos;s surprisingly that I only just recognized that I don&apos;t really notice him much.</div><div><br/></div><div>during a discussion about heads-up displays in cars, I expressed some surprise that almost no one at our table had heard of the feature, which has been present in modern cars for years. I caught the JP looking at me. I was feeling just slightly pretentious, and I wonder if he picked up on that. I don&apos;t really care, of course. for some reason I didn&apos;t simply mention that I once had a car with a HUD.</div><div><br/></div><div>today I opened up some more to cody about my want and fear of being in a relationship, in response to yet another text from him about being able to see too much on facebook. he suggested tinder.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>as I approached the crc today, I realized that the group of girls standing around the entrance were handing out cards for something. one of them spoke to me and asked if I were interested in rowing. I awkwardly muttered an incomplete response. not even an, &quot;I&apos;m just here to work out.&quot; I stopped at &quot;to&quot;. she said that I &quot;could work out on a team&quot; and I answered &quot;maybe next time&quot; in a low, quick voice. it didn&apos;t even make sense. what I should have said was, &quot;will you be on that team?&quot; maybe next time.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">8-24 f</span></div><div><br/></div><div>slow friday at work. the Rashida had me talk to Anthony on the phone about a bug in my pospad groovy script. it&apos;s odd and funny to be talking about work in these journal entries.</div><div><br/></div><div>cody and I had been texting on and off all week, a lot more often than usual. I figured it was due to his want to get away from Social Media. we met up for dinner at three dollar cafe, where he told me about a pseudo-date (?) that he went on with Barb yesterday. and he continued about wanting to remain friends with Barb, so he should dial down his reciprocations to her flirtatious advances. she may be more deeply into him than I&apos;d previously thought. it&apos;s more than mere lust, she has actual emotions for him. I still feel quite distant from all this, so I was able to view it objectively. it would take some effort to fully imagine what she&apos;s feeling. is she hurting, is she conflicted? cody speculates that maybe she&apos;s the type of person who always needs someone to fall back on emotionally. that&apos;s what her Mac is for. I still don&apos;t know if he recognizes what&apos;s going on, but it would suck to be in his position right now.</div><div><br/></div><div>after the disappointing dinner at three dollar cafe, we found two birds parked nearby and rode them to and around tech campus. most of it was empty at this hour, but the housing areas were loud and packed. I remembered that this was the first week of the fall semester. I&apos;ll never know what a frat party is like. cody kept pointing out the women. some of it was memory lane for just a few moments. I&apos;d driven around parts of it regularly the past few years, but the interior had remained un-revisited nearly this whole time.</div><div><br/></div><div>guess cody really didn&apos;t want to return home just yet, so we drove to his apartment building&apos;s garage and sat at a bar outside there for a little while. it was filled with loud and obnoxious soccer fans watching a game I had no clue about. cody relayed to me his feeling of being &quot;left in the dust&quot; upon seeing his ex move on, and how that&apos;s spurring him to try to meet more new people (women) because it applies that pressure. pressured for time? as he was talking about that, I suddenly realized an interpretation of a semi-recurring theme I&apos;ve had in my dreams. the ones where I&apos;m getting ready to leave on a trip, but am desperately trying to get all of my things packed and ready to go, only I&apos;d waited too long before starting and am now running out of time. that anxious, scrambling feeling. I think I now know what that means.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">8-25 s</span></div><div><br/></div><div>cody seemingly took some initiative this morning, making an effort to get that Diana&apos;s contact information so he could invite her on a hike sometime or something. I never tried talking to her. although I was with them when we all parted ways, and she said &quot;nice to meet you&quot; to me twice.</div><div><br/></div><div>at the jiu-jitsu gym today, Mallory said hi to me but looked way before I could respond. there was a black guy with long dreads named...Dana? turns out he was probably even newer than I am. while we were practicing low angle shots, he kept complimenting me. while we were playing Jacob&apos;s &quot;game&quot; where we try to drop and touch the other person&apos;s foot, he said I was really fast and a natural, which felt good to hear. then, after rolling with the Dana, the Dana told me I&apos;m really good, saying that I&apos;m a beast as he got up. hmm. when I asked, Hannah said bjj has been less fulfilling for her lately, but I didn&apos;t get any details.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">8-26 n</span></div><div><br/></div><div>I could have left loca luna last night feeling worse. while it wasn&apos;t a typical disaster for me, it wasn&apos;t the best of nights either.</div><div><br/></div><div>apparently there was some confusion over what the plans for the evening were supposed to be, because David kept bringing up different things he was doing; between dancing, cooking for us, visiting a friend of his, no one knew what to settle on. I must have missed all of that because I didn&apos;t know what they were talking about. they were all fairly dismissive of David&apos;s apparently indecisiveness, not bothering to clear things up with him before planning to meet up together at the restaurant. I noticed that Jay didn&apos;t my number saved in his phone as a contact. when David messaged the group that was on his way, Dorothy immediately concocted a story about how we all ended up together here to rehearse to him.</div><div><br/></div><div>David ended up arriving separately with an older-looking woman. although I was sitting with Heather, Jay, Dorothy, and cody at a table barely ten feet away from where David got seated, he was so into his conversation with the woman that he didn&apos;t notice any of us at all. even though he was facing our table. it wasn&apos;t until cody sneakily took a photo of him and texted it to him that he finally realized we were right there. he must have been there on a date with her...</div><div><br/></div><div>cody was wearing a pink v-neck t-shirt that I&apos;d never seen him in before. he brought up the Diana from the running group, asking me what I think of her. I recognized the moment as a sort of parallel to the time Krish asked me about Abbey, over three years ago (I still remember). this time, I admitted that I thought she was kind of cute. I knew what he was going to say, but I still handled it awkwardly. holding my words back too much. I know what I&apos;ll have to do if I want anything to happen. and I can&apos;t depend on other people to take control for me.</div><div><br/></div><div>Dorothy kept making pressuring comments about wanting to see cody and me on the dance floor. I would have been willing to partake in some kind of lesson if that were to happen, but there was nothing of the sort going on. I knew from the beginning that I wouldn&apos;t be dancing that night. no way. the mojito I ordered was warm and watered down from the melting ice. it&apos;d had no effect on me whatsoever. Barb arrived later with her Mac and sister, joining our table from the bar. Dorothy rehearsed her story to them also.</div><div><br/></div><div>I noticed that Dorothy&apos;s check was over $20 more than mine. I can&apos;t tell if she has more money than I thought, or if she&apos;s just that crazy with food spending. Barb and Mac kept touching and pecking each other on the lips, and every time I saw that, all I could think about was how I know she actually feels about him. when we stood up from our table to head to the &quot;dance floor&quot; she walked over and gave me a hug again, and alluded to the pink platform crocs I had messaged to the group as a joke a few days ago. she remembered when even I didn&apos;t. part of me wonders if she hugged me as another attempt at some jealousy, but I don&apos;t think we go that far.</div><div><br/></div><div>I simultaneously hated and recognized myself as one of the guys who stand around the dance area doing nothing. mentally, I was strongly focused on keeping myself feeling okay with not dancing. I kept telling myself I&apos;d rather do nothing than dance half-heartedly, when I didn&apos;t want to, when I didn&apos;t know how to. excuses. the others swayed around. Jay was moving, and in my mind I wanted him to be floundering disingenuously. David seemed the most genuinely into it. most of our group formed a circle, a couple of us at a time moving closer to the live music to dance some. surprisingly, Heather offered to dance with me, and I cracked under that pressure but got us to move away from the group so I&apos;d be further away from them. we ended up next to Barb and Jay, and had to force my body to move. it felt like I was in an alien body. Heather gave me a sort of crash course, but I was still too concentrated on &quot;feeling okay&quot; to pay more attention.</div><div><br/></div><div>sadly, I noticed that cody seemed the most uncomfortable the entire time. did he feel something when he saw me &quot;dancing&quot; with Heather? he was wearing some leather slip-on shoe, perhaps the ones he tried describing to me one time? maybe he &quot;dressed up&quot; in his pink tee to impress? he said that he wanted to get on a bird. he&apos;d gone to the bar to order another drink, probably in an attempt to loosen up some. at one point he stepped outside for a few minutes. I thought he might have gone, but he came back. then left for good a short while later, after saying bye to everyone. if that were me, no one would care, either. it was like looking at myself from the outside. I believe him now, he is no expert. I can see how his value is lowered in my eyes. maybe I only felt &quot;okay&quot; because he seemed to not be doing any better than me. and if he were replaced with someone who had a level of social energy I couldn&apos;t compete with, I would have once again been devastated.</div><div><br/></div><div>Heather suggested I lead in a dance with Karen, who could definitely sense my discomfort because she said I don&apos;t have to if I don&apos;t want to. I never danced with her. I ended up leaving the place with Jay, who unlike me gave Karen a hug. since this is her last week and I won&apos;t be in the city next weekend, that was probably the last time I&apos;ll see her. if she thinks I don&apos;t like her for some reason, it&apos;s because I was too scared.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>well I had a reasonably fun time tonight at dinner with Dorothy et al. again, et al. being Heather and cody. I was alone with Dorothy initially at sharetea, where I felt comfortable enough to tell her some about my time with ACF in college. and took the opportunity to mention the &quot;cult&quot; with hayson while I was at it. I don&apos;t think I&apos;d ever shared that experience with anyone before; in fact, I&apos;d almost forgotten about it until then. it was a rather surreal experience. Dorothy said that the woman in front of us in line, who had turned to talk to us briefly while Dorothy was comparing bubble tea places, had been looking at me.</div><div><br/></div><div>but most of the attention Dorothy was giving me shifted completely when Heather and then cody arrived. I thought I caught him looking somewhat sullen, but I guess he turned out to be fine. the conversation was dominated with endless gossip again concerning David, Barb, and Dorothy&apos;s coworker Jennifer. wondering if David was on a date. the Jennifer&apos;s obsession with purses. Barb&apos;s modus operandi. how her Mac didn&apos;t buy her drinks or anything for her birthday yesterday. I think Dorothy set a new record for the number of times she repeated herself in one outing, about being impressed with cody&apos;s resistance of Barb&apos;s advances. endless talk about Barb. conversations we&apos;ve already had weeks ago, about her low-cut dress and such.</div><div><br/></div><div>some things I remember: Jay&apos;s new status as &quot;the mole&quot; (according to Dorothy, he had informed Barb that we were all at loca luna together after she specifically asked him not to tell her). how he probably doesn&apos;t have as much money as the rest of us do. Dorothy feeling comfortable enough with cody, Heather, and me to confide her feelings and suspicions about the others in. cody noticing my affinity for nice &quot;designer&quot; stuff. I told them I&apos;ll show them the mcqueen wallet I bought.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">8-27 m</span></div><div><br/></div><div>last night Dorothy casually threw out a comment that I probably would have had a girlfriend in college if I hadn&apos;t hung around the christian people so much, and I didn&apos;t think anything of it. I agreed.</div><div><br/></div><div>the Gorm is here again. I&apos;ve been feeling better about my relationship towards him. it helps having a relatively good streak with fixing work issues that have been cropping up, without too much outside help. today I figured out an android intent issue on my own, and he was definitely happy about that. although I was just lucky that the solution turned out to be easily available. he asked to speak to Zach alone outside, who was once again absent for the dev-standup call and didn&apos;t show up until past noon, and definitely wasn&apos;t expecting to see Gorm. maybe it was about his reliability?</div><div><br/></div><div>I just realized today and Ben&apos;s and my personalities are fairly compatible, and that meeting someone with whom you click (eh) like that doesn&apos;t always happen.</div><div><br/></div><div>cody informed me via text that David wants to have lunch with him and me. it&apos;s scheduled for tomorrow. we discuss him in the group text with Dorothy and Heather. I can see us favoring that group over the one with Jay.</div><div><br/></div><div>cody also announced that he&apos;ll be trying out a dating app, coffee meets bagel. maybe I should try it too. I haven&apos;t messaged any of my few tinder matches yet.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">8-28 t</span></div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m flying home on friday afternoon and haven&apos;t been thinking about it at all. the last time I flew home was early april.</div><div><br/></div><div>David was the one who canceled lunch on us today.</div><div><br/></div><div>another anxious spell after looking at myself in the mirror. sometimes that&apos;s all it takes.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">8-29 w</span></div><div><br/></div><div>the Mallory again messaged the small messenger group she created with me, Hannah, and one other, asking to help her train. I think all of us said no. how does that make her feel?</div><div><br/></div><div>there&apos;ve been several bursts of communication via text with Dorothy and Heather ever since this new imessage conversation was created. so now the gossip about David and Barb can continue even when we&apos;re not in each other&apos;s companies.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>8-31 f</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>so did dorothy specifically think of me when she called for us all to attend the &quot;taiwanese american professionals&quot; event at hello chicken? she repeatedly talked of me mingling with the women, which started making me nervous before I even left my apartment. I didn&apos;t get out of my car until I saw cody pull up, but I still ended up walking into the restaurant by myself. it had been a long time since I attended a social gathering of this sort, and I still wasn&apos;t as acclimated to the environment as I would have liked. standing off to the side by myself for a few minutes before one of the guys motioned me over. I introduced myself to a few random people. feeling out of my element and trying hard to focus on relaxing, which, as we know, prevents exactly that.</div><div><br/></div><div>as I knew no way to naturally ease into a conversation with any of the other groups, I continued to stand alone some more even after I saw dorothy and cody walk in. they got drinks, which I didn&apos;t want. I met a Jen(n)? there, wearing a red/pink dress whom dorothy noticed me talking to. it was only for a few minutes and she was a little touchy with several people (including me), and vice versa. she works in the mortgage industry and gave me her business card. Tia showed up, not expecting me or cody, and when I talked to her for a bit she told me I was welcome to come over to her place anytime to cook together, as she&apos;s done with many people now. dorothy introduced me to two friends of hers, a Li and a Jill.</div><div><br/></div><div>it seems I want to have people&apos;s attention until I actually get it. cody and dorothy were probing me with questions about which girls I found the cutest, who I wanted to talk to, what I&apos;m looking for in a girl. it made me uncomfortable, not because they crossed any boundaries, but because I felt so much pressure to &quot;perform&quot; and accomplish something right then and there. I feel too fake being frank about this for some reason. we all talked to another guy about some dragon boat event going on next weekend or so. it seems like a potentially fun thing I&apos;d be willing to try, to Put Myself Out There. and may be a photo opportunity.</div><div><br/></div><div>dorothy eventually dropped her insistence that I talk to a girl and get her phone number, and we walked outside, towards the tofu house across the street to eat. on the way and inside, they probed me some more, repeatedly telling me to talk to the girl named Jill. they kept saying she was cute, but I hadn&apos;t thought anything of her when I first saw her, and couldn&apos;t even remember what she looked like. dorothy said she doesn&apos;t trust Jay anymore, and told me that I&apos;m more mature than he is, though I&apos;m less than a year older.</div><div><br/></div><div>the Jill and the other friend, Li, ended up joining us at the restaurant, and I became very self-conscious after all that dorothy/cody had said. we then went next door to another bubble tea place. there, I spent too much on a shitty taro milk tea. dorothy and cody turned up the pressure again on me towards the Jill. I talked to her a little bit, but I don&apos;t think I really wanted to. just giving in to their...commands. I was kind of put off by her dress and the backpack she was carrying. the Karen messaged me back on tinder while this was happening, after days of silence. I wonder, maybe she was feeling badly about something at the time, too?</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

; 12-03 monday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i arrived at ACF's &quot;encouragement night&quot; late because i was playing l4d2 with Zero the witch hunter. i hadn't seen them all in several weeks by then. they were all writing shit to each other on index cards. i went straight to david's table. originally considered to not write anyone anything, but decided to jot down things for a few people who stood out in my mind. i didn't expect a lot of letters to me because i saw the rest of them relatively rarely. i was right, i received five. none of them from freshmen. jennifer ha said hi to me. it made me wish i had written her something. even something not necessarily sincere, such as &quot;i think you're kinda cute&quot;. maybe it would have made her happy. afterwards we went to a chinese restaurant, the kind i haven't been to in forever, and i had forgotten how asian these kinds of restaurants feel. it took way too long to decide on which dishes to order. i shouldn't complain. i think some of my laughter was forced because i was constantly reminding myself around david to be happier, after what he had told me about myself. after dinner ACF was supposed to hang out again but david couldn't get us access to eighth street so we were sitting outside for a while looking at the few stars that were visible to us. then they all decided to play fucking basket ball while a bunch of girls went off to watch a movie. i think jared wasn't too interested in basketball because he asked if i wanted to watch a movie. but he ended up on the court while i left them to go play l4d2 with Zero the witch hunter again. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i went to david's and ritchie's &quot;man night&quot; the next day. they had phammy's wii there, and for the first time i wasn't very interested in brawl, but not entirely because i wanted to play l4d2. justin le came, and he's a good bit more knowledgable about the game than i am, which was probably the bigger reason as to why i quit brawl early. he kept playing even while the rest of us were watching 'act of valor' for a while. and i recognized that i used to be, or am, a lot like him. downplaying his level of excitement, saying things that in retrospect were so stupidly useless.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i generally dislike a lot of the people whom i realize i am similar to.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i had no interest in the &quot;food relay&quot; that was set up. during the round in which two people each had to eat five hot dogs, one of the guys, whose named i figured out is henry, kept dancing back and forth and clapping his hands like an idiot, while his opponent richard wan just stood there shaking his head.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i didn't play l4d2 for very long with andrew. he was good at the game even though he said he hadn't played in a long time. this is the second instance in which i've tried playing it in a sort of party setting and it simply is not as fun. i couldn't hear the things people were saying over voice chat.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Zero (witch hunter), who is now Zoro (witch hunter), seems to rather enjoy playing online with me, seeing how often she invites me to her lobbies. she said she gets teased at school and that she likes playing l4d2 online because that's where people like her for her. she's blonde and the first time i played a game with her she said she's 13, but sounds older.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>v said that melissa &quot;seems like a fake bitch&quot; when i showed him the way she talks online. i decided to agree. her constant :HUG: and calling me &quot;dear&quot; had me thinking she valued me at first, when she evident doesn't give a particular fuck. still, if i were to see her again, i'd probably go for the physical affection she provides, while remembering that it's empty and ignoring how weird it is.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the database project will be over tomorrow night, so there's a maximum of two more torturous nights in sally's apartment. working there is a total nightmare. it's just such an oppressive atmosphere. i've rarely wanted to see a place less.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the encouragement letters i received are from monique, david, steph, jose, and someone i can't identify. i wrote to monique, david, and jose, and delivered cryptic nonsense messages to ritchie, phammy, louisa, and mike, who wasn't there.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>mo said i don't smile as much and that she missed it. &quot;forreal&quot;, as though she knew how skeptical i would be about her sincerity. ended hers with a bit of preaching. david apologized for getting &quot;upset&quot; with me recently, while i had thanked him in my letter for tugging at me. jose mentioned my &quot;awesomeness&quot; even though we have virtually never talked to each other. steph's is more serious and not heartfelt or personal. the last one is stupid and makes no sense. i wonder if it's from enoch.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>:gap:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>every time i see lisa now it's always about getting lunch or dinner together. i'm surprised that she bothers. she always looks like she may be about to hug me, but she never does, and i wonder if it's because of me. i on the other hand always end up playing with my sweatshirt strings.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
; 12-06 thursday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>nothing has happened in recent days. yesterday i walked into michelle and phammy. phammy shook my hand with his calloused one, and insincerely invited me to work out with him. he started talking with something else and i turned my attention to michelle, who said that she would hug me but she had just been petting therapy dogs at the library, and then actively acknowledged that she had nothing to talk about. she also mentioned a tumblr post of mine that i had made months ago. earlier yesterday i got our database project demo over with with sally and sang. it was a stupid demo of our pathetic project done by a turkish guy who had been in school for eight years and won't graduate for another five. we were graded a 93 on the spot. later yesterday, david texted me asking me to go to small group, and there i said to v that i wished i hadn't come. after he said &quot;fuck them&quot;, he admitted that he was &quot;blindly&quot; agreeing with me when i asked. i watched 'office space' with the small group, but left when the rest of them began watching 'the office'. i, smiling widely, said to david that there are many actors out there who look like keanu reeves. in retrospect, that seemed like a stupid thing to do and say. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a few days i walked out of the CULC listening to sufjan stevens' 'chicago' and realized that i had no clue what i was doing. i haven't been thinking about anjaly or her promise to play.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>music is supposed to be an aid. it's supposed to fix you. cheer you up, make things, at the very least, seem or feel better. but it just makes me feel like an idiot. i have both of my arms resting on this resting on this starbucks chair's armrests sometimes, and i hate this posture.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
; 12-10 monday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this is bad. this is very bad. i haven't written stuff in 4 days and now going on about things that happened days ago is going to feel unnatural. i have played L4D2 for over 100 hours in the past 2 weeks. i hadn't left my apartment room for 3 days. am i going to become the kind of person other people talk about who play video games for so much of their lives that they fail classes and can't ever get jobs or anywhere in life?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last thursday i made an interesting discovery while playing online, a player going by the name of 'Roxies' which is some kind of drug that he did a line of while holding the 'c' key so i could hear him inhale it. he continually went on long rants about uncooperative players online and made snappy, erratic judgments towards new players who joined the game lobby and immediately voted to start, using the same phrases over and over. at first it made me want to join his kind and become that sort of person more. then i thought about about how much easier it would be to live a quiet, safe life, like the people at ACF do (with god remaining out of the picture of course). here i thought of christina. v of course advised to keep away from him. i felt enormous stress while trying to maintain conversation with him, and when i realized i just couldn't keep up i found it simple to dismiss him by attributing his attitude to the drugs he probably does all the time. i'm not really attached to the fact that he's highly knowledgable about the game. i'd rather play relaxed with 'Zoro'.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on friday i almost walked to the biotech building for ACF but jane saw me and i didn't hear her call out my name until i had walked around 20 feet ahead of her. i wasn't even sure i had heard my name, but decided to turn around just in case and what do you know. she saved me from walking to the wrong building. that's funny. i got there mostly after the potluck, and answered yes to every person who asked if i ate already. in retrospect i don't know if they meant the food that was there or if they were asking if i ate beforehand, but either way the insincerity of the question manifested. i finally saw mike again. we played a game where we had to guess a person based on random facts he/she presented about herself, and helen somehow knew, or remembered, that i went to manalapan high school. monique was the one reading everyone's facts and she didn't even pronounce &quot;manalapan&quot; correctly. how the fuck did she know that? david said helen has a good memory. fuck her.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>louisa liked the bracelet i bought as her present. she said i have good handwriting. a girl's handwriting. monique was my secret santa, which was kind of a big coincidence because days ago i had offhandedly asked if she was, when she told me a joke about deadmau5 (i had said i like deadmau5 in the secret santa spreadsheet). afterwards i went to my room to play L4D2 instead of one night stand at the CRC with the rest of them. jared and louisa said a simple good-bye as i walked out of the room with them. i won't see them until next year.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today i rediscovered jordan's blog, after seeing a post that jessie roth reblogged. i'm excited.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
; 12-12 wednesday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>some things that have happened in recent days: </div>
<div>melissa texted me asking if i'll be on campus, then never said anything since i answered yes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i walked past sean, then marie. smile and wave. they did. it's a little sad, after all of our adventures. marie says &quot;hi dan..&quot; very softly, but i could hear. she had headphones in her ears.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>tom wants to hang out with me over winter break. very surprised, very unexpected.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a random friend of monique's friended me yesterday, and we had a brief conversation. i didn't mind. i thought it was interesting, but am worried that spur-of-the-moment contact between individuals like us are never sustainable. 2 other people friended me yesterday, but i only became excited when the random person who i don't know at all talked to me. i didn't downplay anything. i spoke naturally.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and monique and i had a text conversation last night, another one of which she doesn't seem interested in having today when i decided to try her again. i hope i'm not reminiscent of kelly, who's also done this to me only to always drop her contact very soon afterwards.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>finals are over, the campus is quiet, and i don't feel like i've just gotten a huge weight off my chest like i have in previous semesters. nor am i excited to go home. i actually wish i could stay here at school for an extra day, and had booked a plane ticket for friday night instead of tomorrow morning.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
; 12-17 monday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday i played with tom. i don't know when the last time i saw him was. about one year ago? for much of the time we didn't have a lot to say. we watched 'the hobbit' together, which i found somewhat boring and not as epic as the rest of the LOTR. then we had dinner at friday's, where i ordered a steak and where our conversation became a little more fluent for a time. i initiated the question game that anjaly had started with me, and cheated by using two of her questions. tom and amy have been dating for a few months. we promised to hang out again, possibly with lee next time, and i dropped him off at his home. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i drove to the dentist by myself and didn't enjoy it (the drive), not only because i had to drive the camry there. they found a cavity in my teeth, maybe because i haven't been brushing my teeth as often because i've been staying up so late and don't bother sometimes. afterwards i bought 'the perks of being a wallflower' and a red bull 4-pack.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i might have mild depression. there aren't many over-the-counter antidepressants. i googled, and was disappointed. i just read several relationship articles on TC, which, as those kinds of articles always do, rejuvenated me (though insignificantly, i know). i always feel a little bit tired. going to my dad's workplace with him is going to be a nightmare, and i initially protested against having to put on formal wear, uselessly refusing like a 12-year-old girl. after picturing v wearing classy clothes and smiling, i decided i'd suck it up. i haven't been drinking enough water.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
; 12-20 thursday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i drove to v's house in the camry and we listened to christmas music because there was no ipod cable in this car. we didn't hug or anything, and i felt myself slipping into my rowdy personality i can't help adopting when i'm with him. saying swear words felt unfamiliar at first. everything felt exactly the same. i constantly said dirty jokes, talking about girls and sex as though i thought i was some hot stuff. we walked around barnes and noble after getting holiday drinks at starbucks. i want the lego sydney opera house now. it's so easy to imagine that i'll be happy with it somehow.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i am listening to 'wide awake' by katy perry, and i realize that it is one of the songs i heard on the radio in david's car several times while driving to wherever ACF was going to dinner at the time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i may decide to just watch movies at the &quot;get-together&quot; at michael's house planned for dec. 29. playing L4D2 wouldn't be exciting.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i downloaded all of the songs used in this year's 'united state of pop' mashup and many of them suck.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>as i'm thinking about trying to write at least 750 words every day starting next year, i got the idea that it may be easier to achieve that word count if i incorporate my dream journal in it..though it feels like cheating. like a cheating corporation incorporating a new policy. i'm not going to copy the stuff into evernote. i want to try writing it in a real journal.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>tomorrow is supposed to be the end of the world, or the last day of the world, or something.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i have a lego.com account with username 'juliegolden007' and password 'Bionicle', which i must have created in 7th grade when i had a crush on a girl named julie golden.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
; 12-21 friday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>during my flight to home while half asleep i looked out the window and saw the plane visibly rocking and became genuinely frightened for a moment that it would roll 90 degrees or more and crash and that i would die.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
; 12-24 monday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>several things made me sad this morning but i won't remember what they were. 'wide awake' by katy perry makes me think of riding in david's car and that makes me think of ACF and the rest of my college life and i decided that i want to make the most of it so i'll regret less when i think back to these times a few years later. i just read 'matilda' in one sitting, and am now wondering what good it will do me, if any. i have too much &quot;new&quot; music in my itunes library that i don't know if i'll ever listen to. i don't want to go skiing tomorrow, because the only place we can go to is the same as the one we've gone to for the past several years and i'm afraid it's going to be terribly boring. christmas eve and day are and will be less remarkable than ever before. it's mildly depressing. i want to indulge my inner materialist more and buy myself more things.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
; 12-25 tuesday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today seems like a particularly ordinary day of the year, and i feel like i have so little power to make it any more special, or different, like christmas once was, or like what i imagine a good christmas should be. the little snow that fell last night had disappeared before i had gone to bed. i've listened to very little christmas music over the past month, and that's going to end tonight too..maybe it's my own fault. i buy myself too many presents already.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
; 12-26 wednesday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>everything i wanted to say is gone. my mind slept through the end of christmas day and i remember thinking at around 1am this morning that christmas songs wouldn't be playing on the radio anymore. at that moment they started playing in my head and i suddenly intensely missed it all for a moment. the magic has disappeared.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ACF is going to urbana soon. i don't remember the dates. i had completely forgotten.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
; 12-27 thursday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i think i'll just say nothing for the rest of this year so i can dump whatever i want into next year's words. except for the 31st, because that's the only day that's at least slightly more special than today and the ones in between.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
; 12-28 friday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm listening to 'i gotta feeling' by the black eyed peas because it makes me think of high school. reading 'the perks of being a wallflower' is making me miss high school very much. the youth and the time. i wish i hadn't deleted my playlist of songs that made me think of high school. and i wish a lot more things relating more directly to high school. 'i gotta feeling' was one of the popular radio songs, and i'm wondering what it would be like if i were still in high school today and all of today's popular songs were on the radio. then they would make me think of high school instead of college, which feels so much colder and emptier. i was at the mall today with my mom and dad and saw a lot of smaller people, who were young and certainly still in high school. i don't remember if everyone i knew back then dressed the way the people at the mall did. i didn't like the mall because there were so many people, a lot of them younger than me, and even though i was with my parents i felt alone. i saw a small girl dancing to 'gangnam style' on an xbox kinect dance game.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i don't want to play l4d2 anymore and i unfriended 'Roxies' from my phone. 'Zoro (witch hunter' has made more friends in-game anyways and i never use the mic to talk.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i don't want to try to disappear from facebook again, nor do i really want to abandon everyone i already know from tech, i think. i wouldn't be able to do it. i don't know why i still always go to facebook even though i never interact with anyone, even though i don't post or share things, even though i get annoyed just looking at other people share things, even though i'm always offline. i want to say it makes me feel more connected, but it really just makes me more aware of how disconnected i am from them all in real life.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>tomorrow i want to buy cookies and a warm creamy drink from starbucks and buy myself another book even though i have 6 in my queue. in keeping with my wanting fewer things in fewer places, i'm thinking an awful lot about the idea of not using evernote anymore and not thinking very much at all about writing with real ink on real paper. i guess i'll try to start playing with words. just be honest, and it'll be easy as long i stay true.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i don't know why, again, i'm excited for the new year's eve party that's not on new year's eve that'll be at michael dong's house. the thanksgiving party was completely miserable. i'll glance around at everyone and think about all that they don't know.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i don't know too many things about myself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>:gap:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i have just gone to see 'les miserables', and i've decided to write about it. it was a musical, which i hadn't been aware of ahead of time, and wasn't as interesting as i thought it'd be. i wouldn't have understood it if i hadn't already read the plot summary on wikipedia. it makes me feel sad that i'm not able to appreciate the work. the audience applauded when the movie ended, though i think some of them may have clapped partly because it was finally over (it was a very long movie). my dad of course started talking to me about its themes and philosophies in the car. he had read a chinese translation, which i didn't know.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
; 12-29 saturday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today i tried to continue reading catch-22, but i just found it so boring. i don't really want to read it, but i don't want to leave it unfinished either. i just want to read cloud atlas. i guess i'll just have to decide on what i want more. then i assembled a sort of wheelbarrow pesticide spreader with my dad, and then we ended up editing my resume together. it looks terribly bleak and empty, and finding a job with this pathetic piece of paper seems so hopeless. we got to the new year's party at michael's house late, and nobody really acknowledged me and i didn't want to talk to any of them. dad said that charles wanted us to bring a &quot;game&quot; so we brought nothing but our wii unit with a brawl disc inside. of course no one played it tonight. the dads offered me tequila and captain morgan, and i was mildly excited at the thought of drinking, but didn't really. i made myself a rum/coke mix, but drank almost none of it. i'm just going to leave the cup here. i've been sitting in their basement alone with my brother, both of us on opposite sides of a desk playing games on our laptops. it's so freaking pathetic. even tracy and charles are upstairs playing cards with the adults. michael's dad came down and tried to pull me by the arm upstairs, but the more he did it the more i wanted to withdraw and stay. i wondered if i would go or stay if someone like anjaly were to bug me to go. charles' mom asked me if i had ever been drunk. she said she's only been drunk once, back when she was in college. michael asked me what movies i have on my computer, and i showed him and he tried to copy the royal tenenbaums onto a flash drive but it wouldn't show up under 'my computer' so they said never mind and left me in the basement. i only stopped playing when my mouse ran out of power. i was going to take the battery out and leave it here, but the battery is one of our rechargeable ones so i didn't want to anymore. i texted v and anjaly out of boredom. anjaly replied only twice and v didn't have much to say. i expected as much. these types of text conversations never work. nothing works.</div>

<div>after i wrote that, i packed up my computer and went upstairs and hid behind a wall so no one would see me. i ate a slice of pumpkin pie that michael's mom cut for me. i swear, i feel like i'm half my age when any of the grown-ups speak to me. i bet they treat me differently from the other kids. like i'm a younger child. my brother came upstairs and then took his laptop out again and we played Lego Racers, which michael and charles said they remembered, which was surprising. then i took my mom's keys and left without saying good-bye to anybody. i decided that i want another family friend gathering on new year's eve, which i don't know why i said because this one was so pointless. if we do decide to host it, i hope it isn't too much work for my mom to clean everything and such. the cars outside were covered in frozen water droplets.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm not sure whether or not i'm surprised that i don't like anjaly more. the way she uses the word &quot;play&quot;. i want to ask her to get drunk with me sometime, and i also want to tell her that i'm glad we bumped into each other that night early on in the fall semester. tell her in person. i'm not going to answer her text until tomorrow so i can continue the conversation for a little bit longer.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it occurred to me that i don't like catch-22 not because it's boring, but because it doesn't make sense to me. and i'm upset because the book is strange, in a way i wish i could understand. but i don't.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>tomorrow (actually later today technically) i hope i get to hang out with v and talk about stupid things and have a warm drink and nice lunch. i also have to remember to buy myself cookies..or something..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>:gap:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i had a good time with v, hanging out, driving, speeding through his development, and talking stupidly about girls. his sister let me through the front door, the one i haven't met before. she, along with his other sister and his mother, were very courteous to me. i decided to accept a brownie they offered me. i could see how they were all being somewhat bitchy to v though. only a little bit, maybe because i was there in front of them? v immediately seemed so much younger than the two, even though they were smaller and shorter than him. he paid for half of my lunch. we went to barnes &amp; noble but it got boring quickly, and i didn't find any book i wanted badly enough to buy. we drove through a rather nice and empty road that went around the back of his neighborhood, before stopping by at dunkin' donuts after which i dropped him off home. i went inside again, but there was nothing for me to do there. i saw a lot of young, high school age girls today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we're still going to have a new year's party tomorrow at our house. michael's family won't be coming because they're going to a different one. that leaves only charles' and lisa's families as far as i know. alex lew isn't here. this time maybe i can play bioshock by myself in peace.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm not looking forward to going to my dad's workplace tomorrow morning again. my butt always hurts by the end of the long bus ride. but i agreed to go because i just want to stop complaining about things.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i may simply stop reading catch-22 because v said he stops reading books all the time when he can't get through one. and i have technically read catch-22 before so it won't be unfinished, sort of.</div>
<div><br/></div>

; 12-31 monday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this is what winter break has been like so far:</div>
<div>i wake up at about noon every day. i always sit across from my brother at the dining table, but his incessant clicking as he plays LoL is getting annoying and i want to move away. i've found that getting too little sleep makes me sick and unable to see straight. i remember writing a list of things i did last winter to say to people who asked me how my break was.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>there are hundreds of people crowding times square right now, and it's strange to think that i was so close to it just a few hours ago. everything is so quiet here. i just went to the mall, and the parking lots were far emptier than usual. i bought myself a steam card, and the girl working the register was cute. i had to use a pen to click on 'accept' on the screen and it wouldn't work when i tried because i tapped it too lightly. then she took it and tapped it harder and said &quot;i have a magic touch&quot; but didn't smile.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>michael, charles, and lisa all aren't here. charles' mom and lisa's parents are. they're sitting around the table, having just eaten. it's quiet. all i want to do is sit here and play games again, and i only ventured out to ask my mom where my power cable is. lisa's parents hardly look at me. i'm so aware of how i act like a child around them, only interested in video games. i don't want to eat anything, even though i'm hungry. i never get hungry at holiday dinners. i never eat big holiday dinners.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>:gap:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>there isn't much time left, and i don't have anything else to say. i just didn't want the last thing i write this year to be about dinners. i imagined people in times square jumping excitedly and kissing when the ball drops and it officially becomes 2013, then thought it was stupid for a moment. but i wish i could be one of them.</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>1. never have I ever had a family pet.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>2. there are no songs that mention my hometown.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>.day 338</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this is only the second time in known history that I have stayed up so late to work. at around 3 am, after I gulped down my second sbux doubleshot, the guy sitting at the other end of my table got up to leave, but not before wishing me good luck on whatever I was working on.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>by 4 am I was the basically the only person on the CULC floor, and had only the occasional message from Asta or text from V to look to for solace. although I also ended up looking for people online on Facebook to chat with and low and behold Anjaly was on, and I talked with her a little but she seemed intensely uninterested in any talking. I was faring better than I usually do on all-nighters. after finishing my writing I had nothing to do so I ended up sleeping at 8:30 for three hours. presented the citizen science project in LCC. I didn’t feel nervous, but once again continuously broke down and sputtered while speaking, and wasn’t fluent at all. professor kept nodding at the points I made, though. I wonder if she was just trying to comfort me. after we finished talking and sat down, my partner looked over at me and sort of nodded, and I half-nodded back. in a “well done” sort of way. I also wonder what Mary-Ann thought of me as I was talking. ugly, I suppose. me, fidgeting with my fingers and stammering constantly, forgetting half the points I had wanted to make. my stupid face. she and her partner presented shortly after me and mine, and collected “tickets” that they had handed out to the class as part of   demonstration of crowdfunding. I handed her mine and intentionally let my finger touch hers. she has become a new template for me. this class is now over.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I held the door open for Casey again, in 3790. walking into the class felt refreshing because this one is now over too. I don’t know how often I’ll see Casey and her fish-face from here on out.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now today, nick the lifeguard asked me if I could do the pen spinning finger trick, and as I’ve been doing the basic one revolution version of it since high school I demonstrated it. he didn’t know how to do it and I surprised him by spinning a marker. I told him I could spin a banana too. it’s the most we’ve ever interacted, and I just felt nervous and anxious during the whoe whopping two minutes spent, and wanted to stop talking with him as soon as I could. I wasn’t excited over the new rescue tubes at all. nick also said a what may have a slightly more cheerful sounding than usual “hey” when I greeted him with “morning” so maybe he was just in a good mood.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>.day 339</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>some people look so sad eating by themselves, including the big guy lifeguard with the  glasses and always–red face, the David in 2110 who always states the obvious, and he puffy-faced guy I’ve seen several times around campus, who walks briskly and awkwardly. maybe nobody wants to talk to them. these stand out over the ones who look just fine. which one do I belong to?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>paradigm shifts, my mind has been forming new supercontinents. this happens gradually over the course of millions of years, unless millions of years is actually one night and then you can see the new arrangement and early as the next earthrise.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Melissa called.</div>
<div>I only know one other Austin right now.</div>
<div>Strangers.</div>
<div>Nica again.</div>
<div><br/></div>
I wanted to ask Nica to swim with me.

<div><br/></div>
<div>over the past two days melissa and i have made maybe five IM exchanges combined. i'm practically holding my breath waiting for her, wondering if she'll answer again or ignore me. i'm appealing to the side of me that has held on to her somehow, while another side is trying to remind me that for all intents and purposes, she doesn't exist.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i wonder if i will even remember feeling the way i do now, x years from now.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i guess today is the day i officially let go of asta forever, although i think i did that long ago. maybe not.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>began to give up again during the meetup today but i salvaged some scraps with a 'Sabrina.' leaving these days does <u>not</u> feel good. and that's not good. i'd always liked leaving.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i keep experiencing mini anxiety attacks at the office.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
12-3 w</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it is possible to feel the magic present in the present moment but i almost never manage to perceive it. i end up spending an unhealthy amount of memory on the past. when i look back i can see everything, the things i should have done/said/tried.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i don't know, i really don't know why i keep trying with melissa. just what IS she to you, anyway?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>well, i went to sublime today and the girl working there this time spoke in a very smooth, dreamy voice. i think it took her a conscious effort because she seemed to slip out of it a couple times.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
12-4 r</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>you stay in your self-imposed isolation for too long, you start forgetting that the things you want do in fact exist in reality and are <u>obtainable</u>. what's missing is you.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i read through much of my handwritten journal from last summer to the end of my senior year, and it was somewhat disconcerting. all of my introspection was intensely and narrowly focused on specific areas, and the overall tone was harshly pessimistic. had i been too hard on myself? perhaps it's a good thing that i read through it now; better sooner correct my course than later.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this is stupid, but i felt proud of myself for joining a conversation with my coworkers during lunch. it was about chocolate oranges. still takes some brute forcing. note how frightened i was upon realizing that i had to respond to comments directed at me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>melissa responded today. i'm going to give out some doubt-benefit, take another plunge, and put effort into an interaction. should i start planning anything?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
12-6 s</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>you know, even when i feel like i have a successful night that's earned me a relatively guilt-free return trip, when i take a closer look (and not even that much closer) i see that i didn't really accomplish anything that all. at the restaurant all i did was chat with the person next to me for a maybe thirty seconds. the Angie gave me a hug when i arrived, but i only used one arm and didn't pay a lot of attention to it. sucks for the indian guy who arrived shortly after me. he sat two seats away from me for some reason, and couldn't ice skate. left first. he probably didn't have a very good time. it's not like i did a lot of socializing at the ice skating rink. there were teenagers everywhere, and that made me think back to the time i went ice skating with lillian and melanie. they were still teenagers then, though i wasn't. one teenage couple kissed for at least a few seconds. for the most part i just skated around by myself and talked to myself. there was one girl there who i called an ice princess under my breath, she was one of the most beautiful people i've ever seen.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
12-7 n</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i was going to buy yet another kilometer light chain from ikea, but when i walked in the store i saw all these children holding stuffed animals. there were stuffed animals placed in the area just before the check-out counters. must have been a good strategy because i noticed them immediately and changed my mind from the lights to a stuffed animal instead, even though it was $2 more. i got a stuffed shark. i put into the box i got from staples and drove to ormsby's for the white elephant today. i didn't feel anything when i walked in. it took me a while to remember that this is where i spent the night of my 21st birthday, getting drunk from a long island that david told me to get, while he chatted with two people who came in separately and i stood by and said nothing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>everyone noticed my gift right away since it was in a box much bigger than the other ones. the JB said he would steal it. see i knew he would say something like that. i really hoped that it wouldn't end up in his hands, but in retrospect it's probably something he would have traded for another gift instead anyway. the anna sat at the middle of the table next to the JB and i found myself instinctively gravitating towards her/them. she said something about my gift and martha stewart and i didn't understand her comment. the JB said she was referring to how i didn't wrap it up in gift wrap, just taped a plain brown box.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i think the anna was the only person there who i had a remote chance of having a conversation with. that's my problem with big tables at the restaurants, i never end up sitting next to the people i want to or around whom i'm comfortable. i ordered a burger and sat and waited for my food while not really talking to the people on either side of them. i would only have used them for practice. the burger came and i ate it. then because i didn't want to be around the people i was sitting between anymore, i got and just stood by the pool table and the angie and the kristi as they were making white elephant preparations. the anna got up and walked over to me and we talked for a while. she gets tipsy after &quot;a drink&quot; because her alcohol tolerance was low, this coming just after i'd been thinking to myself for a while about how i like having a low alcohol tolerance myself. because of that though i don't know if she came over here because she actually wanted to talk to me or if because her having alcohol inside made it easier for her. same question applies to why she hugged me at the sweetwater brewery that time. this time she hugged me after realizing that i had drawn the second worst number for the white elephant (#3). then again after the person who had drawn #1 left, leaving me at position #2 which is the worst position. i know i had just bought my gift object earlier that day, but it still made a great gift. the one i picked was a garlic chopper, perhaps the single worst one out of all eighteen. i didn't even take it with me, i just snuck it in with the pile of gift wrap, bags, and boxes that was collected after the exchange was over. i was certain the JB was the one who brought it. i overheard him talking about finding something in his house that wasn't opened yet, and bringing it here, which is exactly the sort of thing i'd expect him to do. he said he had brought the chocolate instead. it would be a little too much to question whether he was lying. therefore i have no idea who had little enough consideration to bring a garlic chopper as a gift. i honestly thought my stuffed shark was one of the best, too. so i brought a really good gift and got a shitty gift myself. i guess i just got dealt a bad hand, but i'm not upset. i wonder if i would have upset at some other point in my life.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the funny thing is that i was hoping for the anna to pick my shark, just as that one time in ACF, when i brought the two stuffed owls (that hurt for me to part with because my cousin had them for me...and i'd paid her for them) i was hoping steph would get them. and she did. also in both cases, the gifts were stolen afterwards but still ended up in good hands. monique got the owls (and she even gave one back to me) and the juliee ended up with the shark. so i'm happy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i left without a word to anyone but the anna, who i hugged one more time. every time we hug we both use one arm. also she patted me on the head while walking past me once, and hit me in the face with the stuffed bear she ended up with. and she picked my gift first. unfortunate reinforcements for the idea that she likes me. i can't help but wonder about that, and i am not okay with that.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this sort of leaving is not very satisfying though. for the first time i realized that i shouldn't have left so early. maybe the angie would have gotten mildly upset. perhaps the anna notices. i should have stayed.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i wonder if, because i'm so quiet, i seem like a &quot;mysterious&quot; type. if anyone were to grab a shovel and dig, he would find that there really isn't much to see deep underneath. i would just die.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
12-11 r</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>see tonight was another one of those nights where i walk out feeling hopeful until i remind myself how little actually happened, and progressed. i felt quite relaxed because rocky mountain pizza, which several ACF people have mentioned i should go to one day in the past, is on home territory. it's surprising how much that helps. i walked inside feeling reasonably confident, somehow correctly locating the meetup group table almost immediately. i guess i just saw someone who looked like an Abbey. i saw down next to a Jessica and remained there for the remainder of the trivia night. this group is the same one as the one i met the Nicole L. at, and i actually saw her again when she came in with the same Danielle, but said nothing to her. i wonder if she remembered me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i know every time i said even one word to the Jessica i felt a little happier, a little more &quot;confident&quot; and calm. i talked mostly to her only because she was sitting immediately to my left (the ones on my right deserted our table for a separate one outside when our group grew too large). every time she laughed even just a little bit at something i said i felt a tiny bit more capable of being my own person. i of course remain very well aware of just how much further i have to go. there were still moments when i was trying too hard, and there were still moments when i was being too silly.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i knew next to nothing about the trivia topics, but we all know that that's not the reason i went anyway.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>some time in the middle the guy Mark, who i thought looked kind of european and who had slickly styled hair, sat himself down next to me and started asking me the usual what do you do here. he had a very friendly demeanor, which i ain't falling for anymore. i wonder, can you train yourself to be like that? it was borderline over-the-top. he said things like he hopes to see me again at some future meetups. i wonder if there was a past point in time where i would have held on to words like that.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my thought processes that work on my human interactions are too accelerated, attempting immediately to draw a final impression from the get-go instead of probing and assessing</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>be honest with yourself. you're always immediately trying to determine if any given girl can become a potential partner. you're drawn to the generally more reserved ones, like the Abbey and the Jessica today. they were...nice people. as i'm thinking about it now, i don't even know what to want anymore. i can click the good-to-see-you button i want. anything lasting has yet to come out of these ventures. anything lasting with another person, that is. am i getting any better? i want to think so.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>but i know that the process is flawed and it isn't something i can tweak directly because it's merely a subconscious thing that i am recognizing. i can only influence it indirectly, which would involve something like training my mind like pavlov's dog.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the Juliee never formally acknowledged me when she walked in, didn't say or wave hi to me, never really even looked at me, and i can be as certain about that as i am because i kept looking at her, waiting for her to notice me. and she can't have not noticed, but i could not pinpoint the exact moment at which she did. because it was glossed over. she didn't acknowledge me until she mentioned my gift shark to the Jessia. when she offhandedly motioned to me and told her, &quot;he bought it.&quot; the Abbey recognized me but i couldn't remember if or where i had seen her before today. some bar in buckhead, she said, with the fancy cocktails. i still can't recall where.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i started feeling tired and wanted to leave while the Jessica and Juliee were talking about car insurance. a Gregory sat next to me and tried talking, but this time i was the one to shut him down very quickly. i thought he was the kind of person who had a hard time keeping a conversation going; like me. and i looked down upon him for that. how hypocritical? the Rachel and Jessica got up to leave first, and after a few seconds i took the opportunity to get up too. ultimately the night ended with limp good-bye waves without eye contact and me pretending not to care.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this morning tom texted me about his computer build. it was unexpected; whether or not he had already built one or was still planning, i didn't think he would ever come to me about it anymore, or about anything else. then he didn't bother replying after i told him that i wanted to record myself playing alien isolation.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>someone can have just a single, small frustrating mannerism that i will magnify and use as a reason to dislike his entire person. some coworkers never look at me when we pass in the hall. others, like the Greg and sometimes the Amber do, but then i just find something else i don't like, such as how the Greg just pointedly nods at me and Amber puts on a half-smile half the time. the Marie, though, always smiles nice and wide, and the Marty mutters my name in a low voice. why do i find some of them annoying and others fine?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today at the office i was looking at the JP, with his oddly shaped face and thin glasses, very reserved posture, and silence, and thinking that he may very well be a perfectly cool person if i could look past my disdain.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>disdain towards multiple people, that i definitely have no right whatsoever to be holding towards anyone.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
<div>12-13 s</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the Ben keeps making jokes about my white shirt and how it's dangerous because food stains would be easily visible. i don't understand why he drags the jokes out for so long (he first mentioned this over a week ago). he spilled a little water on me when i bumped him while trying to move into a different seat. he said he was sorry and i believed him, but the way he said it seemed a little off. it's probably just me. i noticed that i felt almost as scared as i would be if i were the one to have spilled water on someone else. i didn't even react. i just froze for a moment because i knew i was supposed to act a little bit surprised, so i froze and tried to make a surprised face so everyone could see that i was surprised. that i got some water spilled on me. when i actually didn't care.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at whole foods, a bagger complimented my hoodie, my dark blue hoodie that i've had for a couple years now. maybe he was just being nice, because he was really nice while putting my three items into a bag. i guess it worked because i felt happy that someone apparently thinks my plain blue hoodie looks good on me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i really had to persuade myself to get out of bed &quot;early&quot; this morning to go to the hike. driving to the meetups that are 25-30 minutes away always feels sad. because i'm driving myself, alone, in a car, to see what will become of my meeting with a group of strangers. it seems like a sad and lonely thing to do. there was already a circle of people standing by the trail entrance when i got there, and i made the rather safe and correct assumption that they were who i was looking for. today I met a Terri, Eric, Brandon, Morgan, Jessica, Gary, Crystal, and Dean. the Gregory from thursday was also there. he clearly had no issue recognizing me but started off his acknowledgement with a &quot;I think&quot; as in &quot;I think I saw you at&quot; or &quot;I think you were at&quot; so and so. i didn't like the Gary's voice. the Dean arrived late after getting lost. i thought he seemed the whitest person i've met in a while. he also looked like he didn't really want to be here.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we started walking and i found myself at the rear again, with the other people among us who were clearly the worst at talking, that would be the Terri and the Eric. i couldn't handle that. at least the Eric tried. but i wasn't about to stick around for a lost cause and soon ran up to the front of the pack, led by the Brandon and Jessica. they seemed to be the most easygoing and relaxing to talk with. that thing about forming your first impression within seconds of meeting someone holds some truth. basic characteristics are nearly impossible to hide and are showcased whether you want them to be prominent or not.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i realized that i experienced some fulfillment whenever i actually, finally open my mouth to say something of substance. it must still be separate from the energy that i as an introvert expend when in a flock. that's not the energy that gets recharged when i say something. it's something different, but something that i need desperately. a form of reassurance, self-fulfillment. it's more than just rewarding, it feels like being able to breathe after being smothered and suffocating for so long.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the Morgan had many interests, and that's another area that I'm lacking sorely in. actual things that i actually like to do. she mentioned the outdoors, walking, swimming, 90's music, farmer's markets, art festivals. how the hell do i discover passions for myself? this is why i feel so undeveloped.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the actual hike was very unremarkable. we never stopped for very long to look at the water or the dolls and artifacts scattered around the short trail. someone mentioned lunch so we decided to go to a place called fox brothers. we all went except for the Terri. i noticed she stayed in her car as i was the last one to leave the lot. i wonder if she simply wanted to leave.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>because parking at the fox brothers is known to be limited, we all parked in a plaza nearby and carpooled for a short distance. i rode with the Morgan and the Crystal and the Brandon drove. the Brandon is a hijacker type. as soon as I got into his car i immediately thought about going on a road trip. his car is a toyota 4runner which is one of those definitive road trip type cars. there happened to be one parking spot for us to take, and we hardly had to wait for enough seats to open up for us. everyone was commenting on how well things went for us.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>while and after eating, i had no choice but to join the conversation on my half of the table, where the Eric, Jessica, and Gregory were sitting. the Eric is an instant lost cause. lost causes are given up on and ignored. this is distressing because i am aware of my own status as a lost cause. the very thing i'm scrambling to rectify, to fix. i want to say that i said as much as i could, but it was hardly a contribution and i felt fake and robotic. the Jessica kept making eye contact with me while she was talking though. i hope that's a good sign. i don't think i saw her look to the Eric ever.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a cat came up to us in the parking lot as we were leaving. i missed the opportunity to say &quot;hey, buddy!&quot; to it with the same inflections as the way theRadBrad says it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>another distressing thing is the vibe i got that the Morgan became less and less interested in talking to me. not that there was much to begin with, just that it was steadily declining. this just made me more hopeless as i focused on how i must look. at least the Crystal talked to me for a little bit. she looks like krista. i hope to see her again because i feel like we could be good friends.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>some time later that day i went to get a haircut at the same asian place i went to two times previously, only this time i got served a more inexperienced guy who kept putting the hair buzzer on the floor and picking it up when using it on me again. the fuck. he was also really quiet (in an extremely undesirable way that made me dislike him immediately) and not engaging at all. i didn't tip him. i felt mean, but i wasn't about to do it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the trivia meetup with the Angie's group seemed more useless than usual. i guess that because i spent thursday and this morning with people much closer to my age, i suddenly noticed that everyone in the Angie's group is much older than me, making it pointless for me to try to associate with them. they aren't who i'm looking for. therefore they're a waste of time, then. i like that the Angie is familiar now, but i still wasn't inclined to stay. she keeps doing things like taking selfies with me (and my shitty haircut), touching my arm, and briefly touching her head on my shoulder. i really, really hope it means nothing. i went on my phone a little more than i'd usually allow myself to while in a social setting, and then left early with no excuse. the Tim fist bumped me on the way out. it's an immature gesture. he's a nice guy, but i don't know what he's doing.</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
12-15 m</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ROdNEY was right about it being rude of tom to not answer me. i'm a little embarrassed at the amount of time i spent critiquing his parts list and putting a new list together for him. i know i didn't have to do any of it. even though i didn't really do it specifically for him, i still did. and he never answered me in any way until this morning and the only he asked was to make sure that the revised list i sent him was indeed better than his. of course it is. but the way he asked seemed thoughtless and a little bit curt. i'm surprised whenever he includes an emoticon because those indicate that he still remains friendly. or is trying to seem that way.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i've built up so much frustration inside myself at people who don't answer messages. here is everyone: monique, who breaks off text conversations whenever she feels like it; tom, who ignores my texts whenever he feels like it; a tumblr user who never answered one of my ask replies; and of course melissa, who is nearly infuriating. taking up to days to respond to facebook messages, before aborting the conversation altogether, despite having expressed interest in meeting up with me. then never following through. i just don't learn, because with her this has happened multiple times. i suppose this could be her way of saying no to me, which would be stupid because it's literally made up of yeses. i'll tell myself once more that i won't waste any more time on people who are clearly already not using any of theirs on me. there's a simple answer to why people ignore me like they do, and that is that i'm not worth their time to them. every time i scream that question into the void, i'll have the answer now.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i don't really want to do too much thinking about the office. the Harry always seems tired. always sounds tired. probably is. he also has one of the scratchy voices, but he uses his voice often enough. at lunch the Susan started talking about things that actually don't matter in the grand scheme of things, and that's perfectly okay. i kept focusing on the Christian and thought that he's probably a cool person if i don't keep letting my irrational hate get in the way. it's just a matter of opening up to people and accepting that it's my own mind that is the problem. nothing to do with any of them, really.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i can't call my ups and downs those anymore, those hills and valleys. i have been feeling low the past few days. the guy at the barber fucked up my haircut, the skin on the back of my hands is dry as fuck, i'm experiencing another lapse in confidence and optimism. i feel extremely unattractive. there it is again. incapability and worthlessness. i don't think about this a lot, but i wonder how much my brother will surpass me before he reaches my age.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i don't have any music to remind of the last phase of this year. the beginning of the new world had ghost stories, and the subsequent despair had little machines and truslow. i thought i could use christmas music, but christmas is a joke now.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>did i ever think i would end up here? </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the Kyle is an asshole, he's always on his phone at the lunch table and remained quiet throughout the conversation. that i took no part in either, as i desperately tried to think of something i could say that pertained to cooking chicken in a crock pot. i hate it when he talks because he can still do something that i can't.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>just before i and the coworkers were leaving for lunch, gathered in the lobby, i asked about a buddy lunch thing that was going on today and was completely ignored, as the Bobby started talking about one of the people who had just walked past. i don't think he was answering me but had misheard my question, he probably just didn't hear it or didn't care. but if he didn't hear it, how come the Susan did? only she answered me after the Bobby stopped talking about his shit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm quiet used to and okay with being ignored. outspoken. made to feel like i don't exist. that's what happens to the quiet members of groups. they get phased out. they remain afterthoughts if they're lucky. but remember: if you're quiet, then you get ignored.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i had to drop off another newegg return at the UPS store and a man came up to me asking me something about getting something at the pizza hut. he must have been asking me to buy something for him. i couldn't understand his slurry words. i went inside the UPS store first, and he wasn't outside when i exited. so i briskly got in my car and started the engine and started to back out. but then i think i saw the man in the pizza hut, presumably waiting for me inside? i don't ALWAYS ignore homeless people (assuming he's homeless, or at least very poor) but today i just wanted to get the fuck out.</div>

<en-note><div><b>12-15 t</b></div><div><br/></div><div>i&apos;ve been avoiding writing anything at all for weeks. it&apos;s been nearly three since the thanksgiving party, and most of everything that&apos;s been dancing in my mind in the time before and after that has faded away. the most important thing is that my dad was basically miserably failing at trying to set me up with a girl, the daughter of some random person he was once classmates with in middle or high school or whenever, and i realized how much of a broken mess i still am around people. i still can&apos;t lead. i drank too much wine too quickly and everyone could see. though i don&apos;t remember feeling as drunk as i would have liked. at one point i had my arm around tracy and she was talking to me in a manner that suggested she thought i was a lot drunker than i actually was. it was too weird. the rest of the party was just pseudo-socializing. as least it wasn&apos;t as boring as it would have been if they all began playing their card game. instead we passed around a phone and played a charades-like thing, i don&apos;t remember its name.</div><div><br/></div><div>i&apos;m still complaining about the same things that i have been for years. the longer i stay still, the more difficult it will become to move. i need to keep thinking about what i&apos;m going to regret not doing/having done now, in upcoming years. the jessie from &apos;paradoxicalsentiments&apos; is doing so well. maybe i could draw more inspiration from her.</div><div><br/></div><div>i wonder what the valerie looks like when she&apos;s masturbating (assuming she does).</div><div><br/></div><div>a couple days ago the harry mentioned that your coworkers are the people you spend the most time of your life with on a day-to-day basis, something that i had forgotten about/never considered. it disgusted me. i don&apos;t hate the people i&apos;m with but i don&apos;t want them to be my friends. i don&apos;t want to think of them as friends. and that&apos;s a problem, surely...the chris still disgusts me sometimes. that&apos;s how strongly i feel about it. i don&apos;t want to be with him but i work out with him and the mark every weekday. i feel so reduced when i&apos;m around them. i have to force all of my behavior. i have to remember how to fucking walk. i can&apos;t act naturally. i never can now, unless i&apos;m alone.</div><div><br/></div><div>i&apos;m almost over-planning this winter break trip to home, wanting it to go as smoothly and perfectly as i can make it. i&apos;ve been thinking a little bit less about last october/november/december and the sights and sounds of the time. i may end up listening to high school era music on the return trip. mixed feelings both real and fantasy. i have too much nostalgia for moments that i only ever imagined or dreamt up, or saw in movies, or envisioned in those songs. almost no real ones. there&apos;s no point in writing down real memories or constructed ones. either way, no other person would be able to (re)live them. so no need to worry about it being &quot;lost.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s only going to be two weeks. right after getting back from thanksgiving i&apos;d been thinking it was &quot;only going to be three weeks&quot; until the two-week winter break. how can i ensure that i make the most of my time at home?</div><div><br/></div><div>i wish i could have a family of friends (who remember me).</div><div><br/></div><div>sometimes i still think about steph and how she&apos;s married now and how far i am behind that stage in life. pretending i&apos;m someone who hasn&apos;t gotten over her.</div><div><br/></div><div>v has no reason to be sympathetic.</div><div><br/></div><div>all i can think about is how i&apos;ve always been alone.</div><div><br/></div><div>some songs just capture memory especially well. even built ones.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>12-19 s</b></div><div><br/></div><div>this time last year my hands were extremely dry and cracked and i was washing them constantly trying to moisturize them. this time they&apos;re red and look like they have a rash but i&apos;ve been using actual moisturizer.</div><div><br/></div><div>things kind of fell apart this morning because it took me so much longer to finish packing than i thought it would. i still had to sort out all of my laundry from last night. then i ended up having to leave the digital piano at my apartment. i hope that&apos;s not another lost cause. it cost $600 after all. but sadly it won&apos;t be a part of this year&apos;s winter memories.</div><div><br/></div><div>thank goodness i had started packing my car as early as thursday. i spent over three hours this morning sorting everything out, moving things to and from the car until everything was finally ready at 11:30 am. skipped breakfast in favor of soylent, given the time constraint. and good thing i did, or i otherwise wouldn&apos;t have made it to the chipotle in time.</div><div><br/></div><div>it feels a little different this time. much shorter. and i seemed to not have been paying enough attention while it was happening, no matter how hard i tried to. i&apos;m beginning to tire of some of the ocremix tracks. if i ever drive up again i don&apos;t know if i can sit through it all for another run. it feels like i didn&apos;t have enough time to get excited about it, and now it&apos;s going to be over before i know it.</div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday as i was filling up at the chevron by midtown someone gestured to me and asked me to call a supermarket to ask them if they had seen his cell phone that he&apos;d left behind earlier. i wonder why he asked me. i didn&apos;t have time to think about refusing so i called the &quot;food depot&quot; and stumbled on my words a bit as i was asking them if they saw a cell phone. they hadn&apos;t. he thanked me for my help as he went off to deal with his problem. i had no such problem to have to deal with.</div><div><br/></div><div>then at the mcdonald&apos;s a seemingly homeless man watched me as i parked my car and squeezed between two other cars that had both parked really close to my spot. i pretended not to see him at first, but he called out at me as i got out. commented on the parking to establish something, then asked for a dollar. i gave him one and he fist bumped me and wished me a happy holiday.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>12-31 r</b></div><div><br/></div><div>how am i spending the last day of the year?</div><div><br/></div><div>alice says she will be alone and that she&apos;ll either watch some tv show in her dorm or simply sleep through it, and i thought it might actually be a fine idea to just sleep through it. that would further reinforce my developing viewpoint of new years not being a special day.</div><div><br/></div><div>two &quot;parties&quot; in the span of four days with the same few people. i saw michael&apos;s new house for the first time. tried to entertain myself with the piano but i&apos;m not good enough at it yet. he offered me spiced rum and everyone seemed excited for me to try it. i had my sweetwater blue. his girlfriend was there and i saw her for the second time. the first was last thanksgiving...over one year ago. i thought she looked like a combination of mona and lisa xia at first, but then realized she more closely resembled christine park in behavior. i wonder if they have sex and what it looks like if they do. the younger ones (tracy, lisa) are our equals now, or at least that&apos;s how i see it. they&apos;re in college and i&apos;m both more and less comfortable with them. while talking ages it came up that lisa is now 18 and that make me think of &quot;of age&quot; and being able to appear in a porn film. although i think that was partially primed by something one of the other guys there said. the guy in question looked like henry ung and arrived with his sister, who i initially thought wasn&apos;t very attractive but changed my mind later. he kind of talked like henry ung too. he remembers me from some time earlier, but i have no recollection of him.</div><div><br/></div><div>i became reserved and too on guard and i know exactly why. they all started playing card games, and my fear of competition surfaced. i put too much effort into trying to be cool and that sort of thing always achieves the opposite. it can be felt by everyone in the room. i couldn&apos;t keep this in mind and still became the person i&apos;ve been trying to get away from. i only relaxed when they all started playing something else, like mario party 7, and later on the same charades-ish game that we played at the thanksgiving party at our own house last month.</div><div><br/></div><div>the reason i am unhappy has remained the same for so many years.</div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday was another &quot;party&quot; at charles&apos;s house, the least optimal location. only two other families were there, including us, and there was absolutely nothing to do. the rest of them just wanted to Play Cards and all my brother and i wanted to do was go home.</div><div><br/></div><div>i had never realized as much as i did then how adorable charles&apos;s mother is.</div><div><br/></div><div>i spent today playing tank maps with &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE and watching the second &apos;harry potter and the deathly hallows&apos; movie. what other moments do i remember from today, this break, this summer&apos;s break, and last winter&apos;s break?</div><div><br/></div><div>i felt considerably more optimistic last year than i do now. it&apos;s a loss of faith and trust in myself. not sure if i&apos;m subconsciously trying to make excuses. i&apos;m eliminating the new year as a reason/motivation to get something started. i&apos;ve seen what happens when i try to maintain that mindset. i end up letting myself down. everything ends up crumbling anyway. this time all i see when i try to look ahead is darkness. feeling particularly anxious. in a time when everything should be looking up and getting better, i feel as stuck as i see i&apos;ve always been. hopefully one day i&apos;ll be able to look at this moment in time and laugh about it.</div><div><br/></div><div>i don&apos;t have much else to say. i&apos;ve been embracing a lot of dark sides in me by giving up hope after hope. i can feel the descent, my stomach rising. still running frantically on the hedonic treadmill. looking desperately for thing after thing to satisfy myself. there&apos;s something borderline evil about it.</div><div><br/></div><div>of course these two weeks flew by. failed, again, to keep my attention in the present. always fantasizing and romanticizing. nothing is waiting for me back down in atlanta. and i&apos;m running out of time. so quickly. i don&apos;t have any resolve this time around. i&apos;m letting myself die. with nothing real to look forward to. it&apos;s almost hilarious, how i&apos;m trying so hard in vain to make my life &quot;better&quot; for myself. dedicating so much effort and energy to something that is ultimately so fruitless. trying so hard to sustain something worthless.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div style="zoom: 0.9;"><div><b>12-4 n</b></div><div><br/></div><div>I know that alice only asked me to lunch/coffee because her mom must have told her to.</div><div><br/></div><div>I had a dream about &quot;lake lanier&quot; only it was nothing like the real lake lanier, and in it I was thinking about how it had already been two years since I was last there (in the dream, not reality). and subsequent thoughts spiraling out of control thinking about the past.</div><div><br/></div><div>the moods of the past two years become more and more vague with each passing day, habits forgotten, images lost. some time during the summer the beginning of this year finally fell out of recency. I&apos;m having a harder and harder time recalling the last third or so of 2015. every time I try, I just get the vague mood. my unstructured yet structured days are breaking the boundaries down, I&apos;m trying to use whatever I can find to divide the eras. there&apos;s a growing number of things I won&apos;t be proud of. things just gradually escalate out of control. I&apos;m still firmly embedded in a whole host of bad habits, and &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE isn&apos;t helping one bit.</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s been over thirteen months since I last played life is strange. or even launched the game? excluding the ps4.</div><div><br/></div><div>I don&apos;t know what to do about the past years. as each individual unit of time makes up a smaller and smaller percentage of my total life so far. blocks will soon become impossible to recall, and I don&apos;t know what will be lost. I don&apos;t know what I have lost already. I rarely think about college anymore, and after whatever comes next is through, I&apos;ll probably not think of now much. every day I&apos;m doing the same things, you&apos;d think that&apos;d make it easier to remember, but in fact it makes it harder. I&apos;m not looking forward to the transition from two to three, and it will come relentlessly. memories are no longer just a page flip away. now I have keep flipping through a thick book until I can find something I can barely read anyway.</div><div><br/></div><div>we&apos;re into december now. if I wait until I get home to hear any christmas music, it&apos;ll be barely a week until it&apos;s over again for this year. I can&apos;t pay attention to the present anymore. every second I spend alone at home is a complete waste. I&apos;m desperately trying to tidy everything to extreme specification or killing time in front of the screen doing nothing, or getting angry with &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE. why do I spend so much time with him in-game anyway? it all makes me annoyed much of the time. I don&apos;t know who&apos;s trained who. I all but wait for him to message me and then I dive in and lose the entire night, every night, again and again. I can&apos;t allow this to keep happening; it has been for over a year. I can&apos;t remember what it was like at my old apartment. I adapt too well, and at the same adapt horribly.</div><div><br/></div><div>it hasn&apos;t been half a year yet, but for almost as long my old apartment has felt like a dream I lived out in half a second.</div><div><br/></div><div>one year anniversary ongoing for: a sea of split peas, eclipse, and folding leaves. I envision a quiet evening alone in the apartment with those new products and this music playing. the room dimly lit with my LEDs and limited overhead lighting.</div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday I went to atlantic station to try to find myself a cheap gap hoodie, and it was festive outside, above ground, once I ventured outside the parking levels. I had forgotten the season entirely...they had a christmas tree set up and some kind of fake snow, and those big lit snowflakes handing above the streets, that I took a photo of last year. I made sure to take a couple shots again.<br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>12-12 m</b></div><div><br/></div><div>what is happening to my brain? how many horrible things have I done to it/myself already?</div><div><br/></div><div>on thursday, dec. 8, I messaged ROdNEY and we talked a bit for the first time in what feels like months. I&apos;d forgotten what he&apos;s going through. talks of always being in pain that morphine no longer helps with, seems borderline disabled, unable to get out and do much. he got a new graphics card, an RX 480 he told me. until now he&apos;s had that MSI R9 290X ever since I first looked at his system specs. I told him about the GTX 1080 I got, and the intel processor I&apos;ve always been too embarrassed to admit I have. he asked for updates with me, and as usual I had none. he keeps telling me that I have the time and ability to go out and do all that I lament not doing/having done. he&apos;s right, but all it does is make me feel a little bit better being reminded that I still have some salvageable time. that can only work for so long. until I let it all pass.</div><div><br/></div><div>bina&apos;s first thought when I tell her I&apos;ll be gone for three weeks is to ask if I&apos;ll travel anywhere in that much time. I&apos;m too embarrassed to admit that I have no travel plans and probably won&apos;t go anywhere. I semi-lied and said I might go to disneyworld.</div><div><br/></div><div>a few nights ago I had a dream that I was reunited with asta. the dream took place in some classroom somewhere in china. she had short hair and was kind of ugly. but I somehow knew it was her and we hugged, although there was some tension between us and I didn&apos;t know how to hug properly. I said something expressing happiness and disbelief. I was still sad when I woke up.</div><div><br/></div><div>the lonely-texting that louis c.k. talked about in that video. I tend to want to do it towards &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE. I hate it and never ever want to do that again.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m done saying &quot;morning&quot; to Jessica in the morning.</div><div><br/></div><div>bina&apos;s christmas party.</div><div><br/></div><div>I don&apos;t know why she invited me. no other coworkers were invited, as far as I can tell. when I said, &quot;see you tomorrow, I guess&quot; to her on friday, Jessica looked at me with a possibly quizzical smile. possibilities dancing in my mind. does she like me? does she think of me as a friend? can she sense that I&apos;m lonely and depressed and is simply reaching out to me? &quot;I would never date a coworker.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>I forgot to take a single picture.</div><div><br/></div><div>I drove myself there and felt the wave of anxiety hit me as I followed her inside to her apartment. I was wearing the adidas ultra boosts for the first time and maybe that made me a little uncomfortable. already present were some people I saw at the halloween party, including the Meg(h)an, who I&apos;m mentioning specifically because she talked about some things that made me really &quot;sad.&quot; their initial discussion revolved around coloring hair, which I was (not) perfectly content to stay out of while standing awkwardly on one side of the kitchen island. I was the odd person out, whom they&apos;d address occasionally, because there weren&apos;t enough people yet to exclude me outright. they asked me easy questions. where I&apos;m from and if I like atlanta. I don&apos;t think there exists a more mundane, uninteresting way I could have responded to them all. I spent some time the rest of the evening coming up with better responses that will never be heard. it was horrifying really, realizing how much my ability has degraded. I really, truly, had not recognized it.</div><div><br/></div><div>listening to them all, no matter how bored I was, did provide some insight into what sort of things girls like to talk about, what they find attractive and past relationships. again, the Meg(h)an was the most interesting, spilling &quot;a lot of beans&quot; that made her trustworthy and untrustworthy to me (not that that matters). revealing details of her previous relationships, experiences with drugs, her own conception. her stoner parents encouraging her and her sister to smoke with them. she gave suggestions to another girl about How to Smoke. at one time this would probably have terrified me. now I&apos;m just sad that I never found it in me to try to associate with her more. a dark thought that it would do me no good to hide from myself, is wondering how many people she&apos;s had sex with and what she looks like doing it. she&apos;s definitely been around and it gives her a lot to talk about.</div><div><br/></div><div>the indian couple who I met last time (actually just the guy) came here too, and I talked a little bit with him again as we stood next to each other while the girls were talking. he let me have some of his wine, a pinot noir. I mistook his girlfriend or wife with bina&apos;s friend Lila again. I learned his name is Sharique.</div><div><br/></div><div>I kept looking to bina to calm myself down because I hoped that I&apos;d find some familiarity with her, but she was cooking for most of the time. I wanted to lonely-text &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE, but there was no fucking way, so I sent ROdNEY a message instead but he didn&apos;t answer and it wasn&apos;t much better. other people arrived, &quot;Charlemagne&quot;, Lila and her boyfriend (there goes that unattainable idea), Tiffany. Lila had on possibly expensive leggings/pants and they made me want to buy something to compensate. they kept saying how good the food was, kept getting excited about it. I think I couldn&apos;t understand it because I wasn&apos;t relaxed enough to have an appetite. I didn&apos;t think the food was bad, but I could not for the life of me figure out something as simple as &quot;the spring rolls are so good.&quot; these cookies are so good.</div><div><br/></div><div>eventually they wanted to start playing some Games. all we had were jenga and charades. it was too difficult to act out christmas-themed terms (although I did guess bina&apos;s phrase successfully almost immediately) so we switched to a board game called shadow hunters. I felt the games-stress build up inside me, from recalling how bad of a mood I was when playing games with monique and co. some years ago. I dedicated a lot of effort towards not being that way this time.</div><div><br/></div><div>I exchanged numbers with Sharique after I flatly said, &quot;do you want to hang out.&quot; I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s ever going to happen. funny how Krish is also indian.</div><div><br/></div><div>Sharique left as we started playing and I didn&apos;t want to say no to playing so I was trapped in the game. Lila explained the rules. her voice is loud and expressive like a normal person&apos;s. everyone&apos;s turn took a needlessly long time not because everyone was still learning the rules, but because they kept talking about other things for minutes in between. they like to look at pictures of the guys they know and judge their attractiveness. I was self-conscious as I thought about how low I must rank to them. no way. I texted Sharique about how it was taking. they continuously erupted into extremely loud laughter, to the point where I could no longer understand it and actually began to find it annoying (worrisome). although they also laughed at a lot of things I said, things which I didn&apos;t even intend to be funny. I noticed that my humor and mannerisms began regressing to immaturity. cheap laughs.</div><div><br/></div><div>Lila kept attacking her boyfriend (Nick?). he looks like a teddy bear, a chubby white dude, with a bright, friendly face. I wasn&apos;t expecting that. it should give me Hope?</div><div><br/></div><div>I ended up dying first, getting killed by Tiffany who ended up being on my team the whole time, unknowingly. the Meg(h)an sat to my left and I peeked at her card after I was dead. she leaned into me a bit as she showed me and our shoulders touched. she whispered in my ear what team she was on. I could have had such a better time if I&apos;d loosened up. bina looked tired, sitting on her chair and not saying much. although after her team won (loud screams), she was way excited to play again. because I had resigned long ago, I got up to leave because it was nearly 2 am and I wasn&apos;t having fun. she gave me a hug and acknowledged it. I held an oreo in my hand as I hugged her.</div><div><br/></div><div>a bunch of them mentioned going bowling together the next day, and making other plans between themselves. I didn&apos;t even try to get myself included, or make myself an open, likeable character. I was stiff and frightened the whole time. now I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ll ever see them again. opportunities keep going to waste. again, and again, and again.</div><div><br/></div><div>these still-new people violently forcing me out of my cloudy fantasies. it hurt, a lot. new resolves are now poorly forged and I know they won&apos;t last long, making them weaker still. I hope bina doesn&apos;t get the idea that I didn&apos;t want to be there. I&apos;m as good as dead if I keep refusing to drag myself up.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>I still find myself despising christian at times, only to still be surprised during moments when he seems comfortable talking to me. we both have a problem being open around each other. to this day.</div><div><br/></div><div>he wants to switch up his gym schedule again. I suppose our days of going together have to end sometime.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>bina asked me if I had fun. perhaps I could have responded more assuredly.</div><div><br/></div><div>I see her still looking at cars. $54,000 mercedes, land rovers. I guess we all have fantasies?</div><div><br/></div><div>the crew now consists of bina&apos;s circles of friends, who barely remember I exist. and somehow they are everything to me.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><b>12-16 f</b></div><div><br/></div><div>I cannot believe that I&apos;m going to leave for home again tomorrow. time is just passing too quickly for me to handle. all year I&apos;ve been looking at the previous 2-3 months in amazement at how little I can remember of them.</div><div><br/></div><div>I need to remember to just be happy that bina asks me to do these things with her at all. yesterday I saw the movie doctor strange with her, the friend Lila, and Lila&apos;s boyfriend Nick (?), who was still as friendly as ever. when it ended I walked into the bathroom while they all just left. we didn&apos;t talk at all. what was the point of having me there?</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m always retreating into my things now. that&apos;s what my life has become all about. constantly finding something new to hold on to in times of desperate depression. nothing can change if that doesn&apos;t stop.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>I had lunch with bina instead of working out. christian must not have been here, and I was hoping he wouldn&apos;t ask to go out for food, because I wanted bina to be the last person to sit in my passenger seat. I tried saying things about how I felt about going home, and christmas, and not listening to christmas music. my voice was monotone and she didn&apos;t respond to a lot of what I said. just leaving me hanging. I guess christian feels like that when I don&apos;t respond to something he says because I have nothing to say.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;d forgotten that she has a twin sister, whom she doesn&apos;t interact with much. maybe she&apos;s reluctant to talk much about her family. I wonder what else I don&apos;t know about her.</div><div><br/></div><div>Jessica said, &quot;see you next year&quot; before leaving the office.</div><div><br/></div><div>as usual, packing and organizing everything and cleaning my place took significantly more effort and time than I&apos;d always imagined. I&apos;d like to feel less stressed for time and panicked this year.</div><div><br/></div><div>I know alice only contacts me when she needs me for something. this time it&apos;s because she somehow left her entire carry on bag behind before flying home. I woke up yesterday morning to her frantic texts begging me to pick it up before I left myself. of course I&apos;ll help her. I picked it up this afternoon from one of her indian roommates.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>deciding on a small taste of christmas music before I go. it definitely reminds me of home, and that&apos;s where I should listen to the majority of it. even if it&apos;ll barely be a single week until christmas day. if I try hard enough, I can allow it to make me feel happy.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>12-17 s</b></div><div><br/></div><div>just putting a word in before leaving. prepping and leaving. before I can think about any of it.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;ll never learn to allot myself enough time to pack everything. even with the process so simplified, I was still behind schedule and still felt the mild &quot;panic&quot; and anxiety of things taking too long. my place looked so empty when I was done. so many trips up and down the stairs. finally rid myself of most of the boxes. backseat crammed with non precious cargo.</div><div><br/></div><div>I left later than ever, past 1 pm after I finished breakfast/lunch at the waffle house as planned (it was packed there). made sure to check every rest stop and to stop at the one with lots of thin trees. visited that starbucks for the fourth time and rediscovered one that I&apos;d gone to before. I wish I&apos;d kept track of what places I&apos;ve stopped at for each trip. most of the drive was in darkness, since I left in the afternoon. it&apos;s getting harder to pay attention to the music and the scenery. it doesn&apos;t feel like christmas at all.</div><div><br/></div><div>&lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE wants to hang out again.</div><div><br/></div><div>I need to appreciate the sun setting early while it&apos;s still winter. it&apos;s already halfway over.</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s no surprise that these trips are losing their charm.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>12-20 t</b></div><div><br/></div><div>during the weeks leading up to my trip, I had been looking forward to this break from the routine. hardly a routine anyway, the few motions I was going through every day. doing mostly nothing. we are now witnessing the end of 2016, in progress. I&apos;ve so far spent 2 of my 19 whole days (possibly only 17 or 18) at home languid and unfocused. altogether not so different from how I&apos;ve been in atlanta. not exactly an unforeseen consequence, more like high hopes for preventing myself from falling down to this flatline again. the majority of time spent in front of my temporary rig setup. I&apos;m already tempted to keep the monitor I bought. once again losing sight of the Big Picture. it&apos;s taken me two days to get myself to write this down.</div><div><br/></div><div>the house continues to be filled with crap. new items appear every time I visit. I drop off more crap every time as well. I&apos;m not the only victim.</div><div><br/></div><div>I suppose it&apos;s due to each day becoming an ever-smaller fraction of this current major phase, as well my whole life. I can barely remember the drive up, and I know I&apos;ve been saying a lot of I-can-barely-remember&apos;s. like the character hitchcock in &apos;no particular night or morning&apos;, events seeming like they did not happen as soon as they are over. instant distance. memory barely able to hold on all that has disappeared. struggling to make the present last and feel real. struggling to pay attention to what&apos;s happening right now, knowing that in a few weeks, it&apos;ll just be another thing to remember. is &quot;depersonalization&quot; the right word for this?</div><div><br/></div><div>we went to the mall the night I arrived, and I noticed more people there wearing the popular adidas shoes than I&apos;ve ever seen since taking an interest in those shoes. I mentioned to my brother how rarely I&apos;ve sighted them and he indicated their being much more popular on his college campus. I realized that I am no longer in the age group that populates such an environment, but desperately want to remain there.</div><div><br/></div><div>I can recall my despair at having to wait an extra two months from the beginning of this year to this august, for this year&apos;s summer break, rather than june, and not only has that passed long ago, but I&apos;m in the middle of my winter break now too. soon, I&apos;ll just be waiting again.</div><div><br/></div><div>alice has stated that she&apos;ll get me dinner or &quot;smoke me out&quot; in return for bringing her clothes back to her. and I believed her words again. she stopped by on sunday night. I hadn&apos;t seen her in...over six months?</div><div><br/></div><div>trying to replay life is strange with the new video card and I just can&apos;t. sit through the game again. I&apos;ve played the game less than twice. I have not nearly enough patience to do it again. all the interest is just gone. I&apos;m not remembering it as well as I should.</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s been a slow process, but a relentless and steady one, complete yet ongoing. I&apos;m so owned by my things, they are what define me now and all that I can find comfort in, because I&apos;m so accustomed to running away from my real problems into the arms of these things. I need to come to terms with the fact that enacting the real changes I so desperately need in my life means letting go of all that I&apos;ve placed every ounce of my comfort in. as I look back I realize that I&apos;ve been doing this for an astonishingly long time. without them, I&apos;m nobody, really.</div><div><br/></div><div>it isn&apos;t just monique, but I was looking at her facebook pictures of things she&apos;s done and places she&apos;s been, and pondering all that the other people are doing with their lives. I&apos;m not exactly sure when I went completely rogue. when I actually made the conscious decision to separate myself from everyone. they for sure never spend an ounce of thought on me. I need to forget everything I knew about them, and them. if I ever want to move on.</div><div><br/></div><div>&lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE still wants to get together in new york. not sure what goes through his mind. does he expect me to travel up to the city solely to meet with him? maybe because he was the one to come down here last time? he didn&apos;t know what the GRE or statement of purpose are. then again I didn&apos;t know until some point either, but still, I don&apos;t think his mind is good for me. as v continually reminds me so. I&apos;m starting to doubt how much he thinks of me as his friend, too.</div><div><br/></div><div>I want to maintain good relations with bina but I don&apos;t know what to do.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m ready to label the christmas spirit and holiday season as totally gone. I don&apos;t know what it is that makes it seem so absent. is something different, or is it all me? there are no festive reminders anywhere...even the music doesn&apos;t seem to help. only four days remain to soak as much of it as possible. I&apos;m thinking there&apos;s a low chance that I&apos;ll get to witness snow this year again. &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE attributed it to being older. that could certainly be part of it. for now I&apos;m trying to keep the music flowing for as long as it lasts.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>12-23 f</b></div><div><br/></div><div>struggling to put my mind into writing my statement of purpose, so far a lackluster draft, in between bouts of nothingness and more L4D2 sessions with DOOGIE, who&apos;s probably more disappointed than I am that we ended up never meeting yesterday. I remember when I was concerned with my brother&apos;s writing level, when I should have just been concerned with my own. there is some flowers for algernon shit going on with me right now. I feel really pathetic when I read my own words back to myself and realize that that was the best I could come up with.</div><div><br/></div><div>I only wish I could leave behind a more memorable legacy for 2016 for myself to look at. right now there&apos;s little to make it stand out any more than previous years.</div><div><br/></div><div>in the evening we had our annual (?) christmas get-together with the usual families, this year at lisa&apos;s house. alice sent me a barrage of texts urging me to come, and I knew it was only because she was bored that she&apos;d ask me for anything of the sort. I made sure to wait a while, until around 7, before leaving the house with my brother. we were the last ones to arrive.</div><div><br/></div><div>the times have changed. I spent a significant portion of the time wishing I weren&apos;t there. I never greeted anyone, just noted each of their presences as I looked around the table, which was packed with food I didn&apos;t feel like eating. some unrecognized faces. a Cindy and a foreigner Mark, 16 and 17 years old. I would never have guessed their ages so low. the girl Ashley was there too, I never talked to her. I pretended I wasn&apos;t interested in or wasn&apos;t listening to the conversation between my brother and alice about his girlfriends and hickeys. it was the most uncomfortable I&apos;d felt in a while.</div><div><br/></div><div>I saw alice&apos;s brother alex again for the first time in I don&apos;t know how many years. he&apos;s different from how I remember him, how I was afraid he was going to be. less...obnoxious. like his sister, being more sociable than me, he knew how to make talking to him easy. something I could feel, but still don&apos;t know how to do myself. I found myself repeating lines, in this instance those about how you need a car to get around atlanta. he left early on to go to someone else&apos;s house. I just remembered that he said he&apos;d message me his steam name. if I only just remembered, he probably forgot too.</div><div><br/></div><div>charles&apos; mom was happy to see me as always. I&apos;ve probably said this already but she&apos;s adorable and reminds me of ellie kemper. alice&apos;s mom said she would make her cong you bing for me to take with me down to atlanta when I leave. I exchanged next to no words with any of the other parents.</div><div><br/></div><div>the group consisting of lisa, my brother, tracy, michael, alex (who left soon after), me, the Cindy, the Ashley, the Mark, clark, and charles migrated to the living room and we spent some time cycling through various games that weren&apos;t entertaining for long enough. I felt my defense mechanisms preventing me from loosening up too much, ensuring I remain uninvested in the outcomes of these games in case I were to lose. which happened many times, especially with exploding kittens, which I learned to play here. Mark, Ashley, and clark quickly lost interest in most of it, spending most of the later night on their phones and laptop. tracy, michael, and charles went back to the adults&apos; cards table, Cindy and I dropped out too, while my brother, alice, and lisa played egyptian rat screw for a while. then the party was over.</div><div><br/></div><div>charles&apos; mom said she had something for me, which turned out to be a stuffed dolphin. according to her, the dolphin&apos;s name is aunt shamu and is part of her family of her other three stuffed dolphins. I think she is a little bit crazy but I promised to take care of aunt shamu.</div><div><br/></div><div>alice is somewhat obnoxious, especially with the slang she casually tosses out, but I don&apos;t hate her right now. maybe it&apos;s because her mannerisms remind me that I&apos;m getting older. her occasional quip towards me is enough to keep me tethered to her, every time. whether she needs a favor, just looks at me and smiles, or talks to me. physical touch that is commonplace for her. she brought up my dream journaling habit again, which I&apos;d first talked about in january of this year. she voices excitement for our planned dinner back down in atlanta. I won&apos;t fall for it anymore, I can&apos;t.</div><div><br/></div><div>social settings like these are what it takes to dismantle my lonely hedonism and destroy my dark fantasies, to really make me feel small for the slimy thoughts I&apos;ve conjured, to force me out into the light that I&apos;ve come to prefer avoiding. once again I felt that sense of despair and urgency to get out, initially perceived years ago, and now somehow fading instead of growing. whatever lame hope I had at the beginning of year I now recognize to be useless as fuel this time around. I don&apos;t know how I can make 2017 different from this one. time is accelerating and I&apos;m running out, running out of everything.</div><div><br/></div><div>tomorrow is christmas eve. just another day.</div><div><br/></div><div>no snow this year either.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>12-25 n</b></div><div><br/></div><div>christmas came and went. curious to think it was a day cherished by so many young and old. and was once special to me, somehow, as well. the most exciting thing we did today was open all the boxes, courtesy of dad&apos;s shopping, in the pile that accumulated next to our abysmal fake christmas tree. they were mostly consumables. shipped to us using an excessive amount of boxing and packaging. one box was filled with packing peanuts which I gleefully poured all over the floor.</div><div><br/></div><div>&lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE is pushing to hang out again. I label his actions as &quot;pestering&quot; while I internally laugh at him, only to realize today that my tendency to do the opposite of that is probably a big reason why I&apos;m in the situation that I&apos;m in now. and I always assume that everyone else will react to such &quot;pestering&quot; the same way I do. I likely mistakenly believe that I hold power in this relationship.</div><div><br/></div><div>the nonstop christmas music is now over on 106.7, and with a week left before the year is over, there is little time left to bask in what&apos;s left of these so-called holidays.</div><div><br/></div><div>I am holed up in the study room all day, stuck in rise of the tomb raider sessions for up to four hours or even longer.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>12-27 t</b></div><div><br/></div><div>daily inactivity is wreaking havoc on my appetite.</div><div><br/></div><div>everything georgia and atlanta once again feels impossibly distant; that effect is still there.</div><div><br/></div><div>christmas has come and gone, and soon the year will go too.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><b>12-31 s</b></div><div><br/></div><div>I wish I had more to say.</div><div><br/></div><div>three days ago I had much time left on this break as had already passed. excluding today and next friday, there are five full days remaining, one of which we&apos;re planning to spend in the city again, partially with &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE. we&apos;ll see how that goes. three weeks should have been an opportunity, but I just didn&apos;t ever feel like going anywhere at all. I&apos;ve been spending all day most days sitting at home playing the tomb raider game.</div><div><br/></div><div>&quot;parties&quot; isn&apos;t the right word for these get-togethers we keep insisting on having, because that&apos;s just what people do, and I&apos;m feeling increasingly stubborn and less inclined than ever to attend. I can&apos;t even remember the last new year. I was ready to spend this new year&apos;s eve-day transition alone for the first time, but my parents just announced that they left tonight&apos;s &quot;party&quot; to accompany me, which is touching. I wasn&apos;t really expecting it.</div><div><br/></div><div>social decline continues to be evident, and I can&apos;t keep ignoring that I&apos;m leaving my grace period in which I can still potentially realign myself. I&apos;m beginning to dislike smiling people and happiness, I&apos;m turning into a terrible recipe and if I keep going there&apos;ll be no going back.</div><div><br/></div><div>there is nothing to look forward to on the way back down. things will simply resume, I expect.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m trying to figure out what I might be feeling, but things are just happening now and I&apos;m not part of any of it.</div><div><br/></div><div>eight minutes left. and afterwards it&apos;ll all just keep going, and going.</div><div><br/></div><div>last year is so distant.</div><div><br/></div><div>maybe I should stop trying to find things inside me and accept that there&apos;s nothing.</div><div><br/></div><div>2017, the new year. there is no such thing.</div><div><br/></div><div>unexpectedly close.</div><div><br/></div><div>and here it was. I doubt I&apos;ll remember how I felt.</div><div><br/></div></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-2 s</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">this morning I got to the running meetup late, because all the roads along peachtree were blocked. I followed a long roundabout way that Cody gave me, and ended up arriving half an hour late. I saw him for the first time in two weeks, and he seemed happy to see me, though most of our run was in silence. at jason&apos;s deli, neither of the Marks nor Barbara were there. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if she never comes again. Cody&apos;s friend the Jay was there again, and they talked to each other some more, and kept talking about their Dorothy.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">because I always want to keep socializing after the running event ends in the morning, today I ended up driving myself out to buford highway and joining an asians meetup group, where I met a whole bunch of people and actually had some conversations with some of them. I felt okay in my leather sneakers and denim jacket and walked awkwardly with them to a bakery across the street from the original location, because it was too crowded.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">the group organizer was a Peter, a fobby-looking chinese/vietnamese guy. his friend a Maggie, a tiny woman whose manner of speech sounds similar to charles&apos;s mom&apos;s. a unique-looking guy named Doug. at first I thought maybe he was japanese. then I learned that he&apos;s chinese, born in canada, raised in alabama. he&apos;s the least chinese chinese person I&apos;ve ever come across and talks like a black person. fairly expressive. an indian guy named Buba (?), with an indian accent, who seemed cool. the latter two are the kind I kept judging, and based on their comments about their experiences with women, I was wildly incorrect again. a girl named Maria who spent much of life in peru. she had an accent, but it didn&apos;t seem to be chinese. another one of the Peter&apos;s friends, &quot;Grace,&quot; who I never said anything to. and one Nita, who I was able to converse with for a time about our jobs in software development. even though I was a little self conscious about my body language and voice, I was engrossed in our conversation and paid no attention to what everyone else was saying.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">as we were leaving, I moved a table back to its original place and made a joke to Nita about working out. she said it didn&apos;t look like my muscles were that big, which actually sucked to hear a little bit. I said it was because my jacket was hiding them. also, Doug complimented my jacket.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">we went to a shanghai restaurant. when I took off my jacket, my arms were more clearly visible through my t-shirt and Nita said they were pretty big. for some reason I pretended to not know what she was talking about, to which she responded with a sort of &quot;never mind...&quot; gesture, which made me afraid that I just did something wrong. a tv was showing some concert with a ton of different chinese artists, and somehow Nita knew every one. the conversations that happened there were pretty normal. I didn&apos;t talk much, but had no problem chiming in if I did have something to say. most of the topics revolved around asian entertainment, and attractive chinese celebrities, and how Doug didn&apos;t like them because they&apos;re too skinny and young-looking. he likes the kind of girls that most black guys are into. the girls agreed that I have &quot;elite taste&quot; in food because I was so critical of the food being served there (it was horrible). I feel like I kept catching Maria looking at me, but I don&apos;t want to get any ideas...we loitered at the tables after we finished eating for what felt like forever, and then outside a little bit more, talking about unimportant things, until someone just ended it and we all left separately. I wonder if I&apos;ll see any of them ever again.</span></div><div><div><br/></div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-4 m</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">the distractions lose their power when others are around. I&apos;ve felt this effect many times now. when it&apos;s necessary, I become ashamed of some of them too.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">yesterday morning I wavered between sending Nita a message up meetup or adding her on facebook and settled on the latter. I closed facebook immediately after and didn&apos;t check it again for a few hours. when I did, she had sent me a few messages and liked my most recent posts. I think for some reason I was hoping or even expecting that she would do that. she called me cute, and somehow that wasn&apos;t surprising either. it made me feel warm inside, but I never acknowledged it.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">we ended up messaging all throughout the afternoon and evening. initially I was worried that she might be into me, but hopefully she just finds me interesting. she replied quickly and enthusiastically, vastly differently from someone like Barbara. I almost forgot who I was talking to, and opened up a lot to her. and she knew how to give positive affirmations and encouragement, about my job and about my life and friends. I wonder if she learned how to be like that. so comforting and inviting. making people who talk to her feel good about themselves.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I also shared some early excerpts from my journal, the ones I had posted to facebook years ago while in spain, and heard more insight into me from her, regarding the way I write. she sent me a couple snippets from hers, too. I got a bit emotionally drunk and began a reminiscence trip while listening to tech-era songs.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I&apos;d said a little bit about the &quot;lonely-nostalgia&quot; to her and she said she understood what I meant, but as she elaborated I wasn&apos;t sure. although she did provide a perspective I hadn&apos;t considered before, that what I missed, or one thing that I missed, about the past is a sense of belonging.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">this stands out because it was a good thing happening to me and she&apos;s been a positive influence after just a day, and I want to see her again.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">last week the Anthony saw me watching my own l4d2 videos, and at first he thought I was</span><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">playing</span><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">the game. then realized I was watching gameplay, which is apparently an activity that he&apos;s never heard of before, ever. which then made it ironic that he proceeded to talk so much of his usual shit about it. the Andrew, though, was on the same page with me, and told me again that I should try streaming. I&apos;m starting to like him a little bit more. I think a lesser version of myself would have considered him an enemy. he seems to not be as close to the others as I initially thought. often packs up and leaves simply.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-6 w</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">Nita and I have been talking for three days over facebook now, and while I&apos;m not sure if that&apos;s normal for her, it definitely isn&apos;t for me. I think I&apos;ve exchanged more messages with her in the past three days than with all over people in the past three years combined. and it&apos;s...worrying me, making me nervous. afraid that I&apos;ll push her away and lose her the same way I lost Kat. just because I&apos;m not fully attracted. who says</span><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">she</span><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">is into me that way, anyway? that could be a presumptuous assumption.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">but she&apos;s repeatedly called me cute, and called me sexy yesterday too. she seemed to have misinterpreted my response to that, thinking I missed the clue. she suggested meeting up to eat at several different places. I think I went a little overboard with emojis and stickers on facebook messenger. I was only adapting to her, and also drinking up all of her attention. last night I told her that I rarely cook, and now we have plans just one day later to go to h-mart together to buy food to cook...at my place. more parallels...</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">bitterly ironic that a girl who is into me at least some way is someone I&apos;m hoping I won&apos;t have to reject again. I hope I don&apos;t hurt myself again. I can&apos;t keep my mind from overclocking. too many ideas. who is this apparent, sudden lifesaver?</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">a week into december. the last 6-7% of the year. the leaves are still falling. the weather continues to be warmer and lighter than I remember last year&apos;s time being. if I were to follow my tradition for the past three years, I&apos;d be mentally preparing myself for the winter trip home, in just over two weeks. the trip that marks the end of the year, towards the transition at home into the next. I&apos;m not ready, and I&apos;ll never be ready. the current end always feels empty, even though things are happening this time.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-7 r</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">what kind of coincidence is it that Nita gets into her first accident on the way over, and there just happens to be a cop who saw it happen nearby to confirm that she wasn&apos;t at fault? I was feeling apprehensive at the thought of having her over and spending time with her, so I felt a bit of relief at first because maybe we&apos;d have to reschedule. but she made it over just fine. I saw her for the second time in the parking garage. she has a grey honda civic.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I wasn&apos;t thinking much of anything as I simply led her into the elevator, up to the second floor, and down the hallway to my apartment. I was too worried about the little things. what she would think when she saw me taking off my shoes. how dirty and messy the kitchen would inevitably become when</span><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">she</span><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">cooked for me. how I would deal with having to walk on my floor without slippers. she initiated a hug by asking me if I do hugs.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">she took a look around. she doesn&apos;t have the same thought processes about cleanliness that I do. she liked the embroidered feather t-shirt that I had bought. she liked my computer, especially the LED ram, which I had turned on just for her to see it. she liked my ikea desk that I had built years ago. she liked the ikea rails that I&apos;d installed in the kitchen above the stove and on the small cabinet doors. she said it all looked nice and normal. I had to concentrate on regulating my behavior.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">as we were leaving to head to h-mart, Nita unexpectedly asked me if I&apos;m gay. the potential reasons and implications of her question flooded my mind and jammed any hope of a lighthearted response. I stammered and said &quot;what?&quot; just like that one time one of the girl lifeguards asked me if I wanted a kiss. she kept pressing me and I simply said no. her explanation for why she asked didn&apos;t make sense to me, but I was barely listening, too busy wondering why she asked. did she like me and sense that I wasn&apos;t reciprocating much? or worse, do my mannerisms and voice resemble that of a gay guy? that got me legitimately worried.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">she navigated for me and guided me onto the hov lane on a highway. she bought up my posted study abroad journals again, once more telling me about how I&apos;d written it in the present tense and how she felt like she were me as she was reading it. I tried to sound as natural as I could.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">we reached the supermarket and she pointed out a few restaurants in the surrounding plaza. we (she) picked out some vegetables and meats, asking me if I like eating this or that. comparing prices. telling me about tastes. I felt like a child, but not because of the way she was talking to me or anything like that. just my position in this situation. I wanted to look for sachima, but we were already halfway down an aisle when I weakly brought it up. and she had to encourage me several times to look for it before I would just go and look.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">we left h-mart and she directed to the house she lived in with one or a couple roommates, I forget. we were there to pick up some tupperware, frozen fish she&apos;d prepared, and some rice. I briefly met a roommate and small dog. I said it was cool looking around a new home environment. she showed me her bedroom, a smallish, cozy quiet space. a thick bed. blank, calming walls. a little desk. a dresser with makeup products neatly lined up. she&apos;s in crystals, apparently. had a handful of those neatly arranged in a circle, too. I also saw a pill organizer and thought it was a birth control pill box at first. I guess it still could have been, but I didn&apos;t ask her about it. I thought about how excited/devastated I would have felt if I were more attracted to her.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">it was well past 9 by the time we made it back to my place. we drove from way beyond the furthest point I had ever gone on peachtree road, all the way down. she pointed out how quickly areas had developed from land that used to be all forest.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">we were back in my kitchen and she began prepping and cooking. I was anxious the whole time because she was on the kitchen floor in just her socks, and I was on the kitchen floor in just my socks, and she put food and bowls directly in the sink, and splashed water from the sink everywhere. I watched as she cut up the vegetables and sliced up the meats. crushing garlic. pouring oil into the pan. the oil spattered everywhere and was all throughout the air. her dishes were pretty simple and tasted nice. she kept turning to me and asking, seemingly making sure that I still found her cooking nice and easy.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">when she finished everything, she wiped away the oil with some clorox wipes and that was good enough for her, and also would be fine for most other people. she sat on my little futon couch and I joined her and we ate for a little bit while &apos;peeping tom&apos; from lotta sea lice played from spotify on my computer. she rocked side to side to the music. I think my body language was closed off because I felt so uncomfortable.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">it was late, she took her remaining tupperware that we didn&apos;t use, and I accompanied her back down to her car in the garage. she asked me for a hug, and asked again if I do hugs after we hugged (one-armed again). I responded awkwardly. I opened the gate for her and waved her good-bye.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">it&apos;s depressing how she&apos;s affecting me in so many negative ways, that aren&apos;t her fault. I would never be able to ever even get this far with any girl without her somehow being into me enough first. and</span><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">still</span><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">behaving so stiffly and flatly, even when knowing that she&apos;s willing to spend so much time with me. I don&apos;t know if it would have been better or worse if she were prettier to me. I feel awful just thinking about that, but I have to write it down. I feel like I no longer have any hope whatsoever of being relaxed in my natural, true self around anyone. I don&apos;t even know what that True Self even is anymore.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">she seems to not like swearing.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">we have plans today to meet again to get dinner at chef liu. she messaged me again this morning. I&apos;ll try again...</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">yesterday Zach and I went to pho king for lunch, where he ordered, in addition to pho, some eggrolls and tea. the tea he forgot about until the very end, and hastily drank a cup or so. it cost $1.50. on the way back, he asked how to connect his phone to my car&apos;s audio. I gave him the auxiliary cable and he played another live performance from phish, telling me when it was and what happened and his first phish show in knoxville. he was really jamming out to the music and it frightened me a little bit. it reminded me of someone on drugs. someone whose mind isn&apos;t fully here.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">~</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">she wore a low-cut top yesterday and I kept staring</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">Zach puts in his earphones and watches videos from his facebook newsfeed while eating.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-8 f</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">what are all the mistakes I&apos;ve made with the Nita so far? letting her come over to my apartment for the second day in a row. she knows where I live now. agreeing to eat dinner with her again. (previously) agreeing to meet for a brunch this weekend. allowing her to come back to my apartment after dinner. allowing her to give me a. fucking. massage. while we watched wong fu videos together. she massaged my back, neck, face, and hands. it was something I had dreamed of happening for such a long time, and it ends up happening! ...like this. with a person I hadn&apos;t imagined and thoughts I didn&apos;t want. they kept me from feeling the tingle explosion that I know would have resulted.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I wanted the alexander mcqueen trousers I&apos;d ordered from ssense badly enough to bring up going to the fedex place to pick them up, because they hadn&apos;t been delivered because I wasn&apos;t at home at the time. and of course, she agreed to come with me. I know it was because she wanted to spend time with me.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I felt uncomfortable again from the moment she stepped out of her car and I was able to clearly see that she had put effort into her appearance. she sat simply while I drove. spoke softly. she kept asking if I would like to go to this or that place &quot;sometimes [sic], with [her].&quot; did she pick up on my not giving a straight yes? I didn&apos;t care about the westin restaurant. I didn&apos;t care about the mlk jr. eternal flame, which I had never even heard of before. I didn&apos;t care about how nice the fireworks looked. how excited was she about tonight? did she spend any extra time getting ready? why does the thought of that feel terrible? is all this just because I don&apos;t think she&apos;s pretty. she&apos;s nice, not nice to a fault, but it still freaks me out. I expressed this to u/sustainablesmile: if I&apos;m so unable to accept someone liking me, how can I ever hold a relationship with someone?</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I&apos;ve opened up to her too much. it&apos;s embarrassing how long it took for before my suspicions became strong enough. I don&apos;t remember. did I genuinely think we&apos;d just be going out to eat tonight as friends? did she think of it as a date?</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">so in addition to all this queasiness, I&apos;m also feeling shitty because I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be able to drive home this year. I used today&apos;s weather as an excuse to ask my supervisor if there&apos;s some way I can work remotely, but he didn&apos;t take me seriously. and I wasn&apos;t in the mood, nor did I feel strong enough, to respond in any mature way. &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE also somewhat misinterpreted my outburst, I think, and I ignored him too. no one knows how I feel, and the only person who&apos;s capable of it...is Nita.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-15 f</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">are there still any leaves?</span></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">at this time, the temperature is down, the sun sets early, and the lights are on.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I went to lunch with the Andrew, Kyle, and Zach, and observing the Andrew interacting with them reminded me again that I limit myself too much, that I still have too many filters in place preventing me from realizing what I really want to say. he speaks candidly. Zach showed us a picture of something he referred to as a &quot;rig&quot;, making me think of a computer, but when I saw it I realized he was talking about some kind of musical equipment. I was probably going to say something simply, like &quot;that&apos;s cool&quot; but the Andrew just said, &quot;I don&apos;t know what that is&quot; which had me wondering why I couldn&apos;t figure out how to say that myself. same thing with some phish-related sticker Zach showed me on his computer. he&apos;s not able to convey the passion he feels towards things.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-16 s</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">there was a small part of me that thought about not going to game-x with the rest of them at all, but I ended up riding there with Zach, because I didn&apos;t want to deal with parking there. he got his subaru new just a few weeks ago, but it was already messy, had cigarette ash anywhere, and reeked of smoke. I kept a window rolled down even though it was cold. his driving habits are annoying.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">the rest of them were already drinking at game-x. the place was similar to the arcade place with the go-karts that I went to with Angie&apos;s group three years ago. the Aaron mistook me for the JP, and the rest of them gave him shit for that throughout the afternoon. the RJ drank a lot for some reason (he told me later that night that he isn&apos;t a drinker). lots of fries and wings were ordered. I ordered a burger and had it added to the tab for the Anthony to pay later. he loaded up some cards to swipe at the game machines. I wasn&apos;t too interested in any of the games. I played a terminator-themed shooter with the Danny. everyone played a skee-ball round for a day off. I landed one ball in a 100-point hole. I watched some of them play air hockey and paid attention to the way they all reacted to winning and losing. I played a motorcycle racing game with the Kyle and the Andrew, I think, where you sit on a physical bike and lean to steer. we played two races and I won first place in one. the Anthony bumped my bike. I watched the Danny win a stuffed purple elephant at a claw machine. it was the first time I had ever seen anyone win anything at one of those. one of the girls who worked there remarked about it too. he went for a hamster afterwards, but the claw didn&apos;t maintain its grip. I carried the elephant around and everyone thought it was mine. the Anthony kept making fun of me about it, calling it my woman and repeating that I was holding it the right way between my legs. I wasn&apos;t able to roll with it and just tried to ignore him. the Anthony pestered me about why I wasn&apos;t drinking. how I didn&apos;t know what KTV is. I wandered around aimlessly until they started talking about going to another bar. I was on the fence, but I knew I should. the Anthony tried persuading me to come by asking me what I&apos;d do if I went home (play computer games). moments like those with him make it seem like I haven&apos;t progressed nearly as far as I&apos;m used to thinking I have. in a strange twist, the RJ could tell I was out of my element and told me not to do anything I wasn&apos;t comfortable with. I don&apos;t know how drunk he was.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">the Kyle smokes too, apparently. he called shotgun on Zach&apos;s car even though I rode here with him first (I said nothing anyway). they talked nonstop about phish on the way there. Zach&apos;s driving habits became even more annoying. the place of choice was the eleventh street pub. the Danny had warned me that it would be &quot;smokey&quot; in there. we found a place to park and the Kyle said that I look pretty fly. I attributed it to the denim jacket. inside, the cigarette smell hit me like a wall. the Kyle got a sweetwater blue, just like me. Zach asked me again how things were going. I talked a little with the Kyle about it too, or I tried to, anyway. I had a hard time trying to put together exactly what my opinions are and how I feel about working here. then I talked a little with the RJ again, about disliking smoking cigarettes, drinking, disliking being around drunk people, and he mentioned smoking weed. I wanted to ask him to hit me up but didn&apos;t. he said again I should just fuck these motherfuckers if I wanted to leave. so I called an uber and abruptly left them all without saying a word. I may get some shit about it on monday.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">it was a touch below freezing this morning. I didn&apos;t see Cody at caribou coffee so I assumed he wasn&apos;t going to be here this time. saw a few new people I hadn&apos;t seen before. Cody&apos;s friend the Jay acknowledged me but I&apos;m not compatible with him at all, and didn&apos;t bother wasting any effort with him. but then Cody suddenly showed up while we were all gathered. I ended up running alone again. one of the newbies, an asian girl, passed me, but never got far enough ahead of me to get out of sight, and I ended up passing her on the last hill. I ran part of a second lap, and I think I heard her and a person she came with behind me. I formed my impression of him before I even laid eyes on him for the first time.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">jason&apos;s deli was opening late again so we walked a little ways over to a restaurant called einstein&apos;s, which I had driven past many times and always mistaken for an einstein bros. bagels. I didn&apos;t realize it had nothing to do with the bagel chain until after we all left. there I got a good look at the girl, Hannah, who looks like lillian, and her friend, a Brandon. also a David, who I had spoken to before but can&apos;t remember when. I wished I could talk to her and them as I listened to them talking about their work in software development. but I didn&apos;t feel confident enough in my knowledge about what my own company does to launch into a narrative. they were new, so they introduced themselves and eventually asked me what I do, and got excited when I told them, because I&apos;m in the same industry as them.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">we were led to a table and I couldn&apos;t sit next to the Cody so I sat next to the Brandon instead. I remained conscious of my body language. turns out he&apos;s a couple years older than me (I&apos;m pretty sure...). I had initially thought that he and the Hannah were still in college. he said I look pretty young. it was nice that large parts of our conversation flowed fairly naturally. the Brandon talked a little more to the David, and they exchanged numbers. he casually invited us to hang out with them at his office, in atlantic station, on some friday. not sure what that&apos;s supposed to be. the conversation split and I listened to the David talk to the last two people on our end of the table about his recent travels and soul-searching. stuff about his marriage, depression, and meditation. I was interested but had nothing to contribute. the Brandon can speak some japanese and chinese because he spent a year and some months living in those countries. the blueberry pancakes I ordered weren&apos;t so good and I wished I had just gotten ordinary breakfast food.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">the Hannah left for her jiu-jitsu class before I could ask her about it some more. I looked for her on facebook and she seems to have a boyfriend. the Cody left with the Jay without saying anything to me. I was fine with it this time because I wanted to stay with the David and Brandon. the Cody had mentioned again that the two Marks haven&apos;t showed up in a while.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">maybe I once would have viewed the Brandon as a threat, because he&apos;s accomplished so much more than me, as I kept realizing as I listened to him and the David talk about all of their side projects. I had and have nothing going on. now I see him as another opportunity that I need to grasp, to help myself get out of this hole. I want to start doing things to make me interesting. to get me outside, accomplished...all that. he said to me, &quot;we&apos;ll hang out&quot; after he gave me his number, too. I perceived it reassuredly. like our friendships are going to blossom and everything&apos;s going to go up and keep going up. I hope I wasn&apos;t too weird.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-17 n</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">it was yesterday that nita initially suggested the board games meetup to me. I agreed simply because I didn&apos;t want to continually refuse to do things with her. today, I started getting cold feet about it and just said that I didn&apos;t feel like going, but nita simply said to come. she wanted to see me. and somehow that was enough. I drove up I-85 to pleasant hill road yet again, and walked into the comic book store. I had never before been in such a setting, had never seen a place like this in real life. I tried to be amazed. the (large) group were in the back of the small place, gathered around various board and card games I didn&apos;t recognize. I stood to the side a bit because nita wasn&apos;t here yet. when she arrived she kept telling me to sit and I had to make a conscious effort not to follow her around like a puppy. she was here with her brother and cousin.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I ended up playing two games, one of them being exploding kittens and the second being a card game called dominion. it was only the second time I had ever played exploding kittens and I ended up winning the single game we played. dominion took much longer, and although I couldn&apos;t magically loosen up, I felt at ease mostly, because nita was the one playing while I just watched and shuffled her cards. there were three other players, two awkward-ish guys who I judged and a cute tiny girl named Amanda. at first I thought she was the group member with the profile picture that reminds me of jessie, but that&apos;s someone else. all the cards were in plastic sleeves. when that game ended I browsed the shelves a bit with nita. all the comics were in plastic sleeves. there were a lot of objects in the store. I had to keep repeating myself because nita couldn&apos;t hear me. she suggested inviting a few more people to see the last jedi tomorrow.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">we returned to the game tables and they dragged me into starting a second dominion game, but I decided to follow the Amanda and nita to a nearby coffee shop while the other two guys set it up. the place was called mac lab, and it was a bright white, minimally decorated cozy place. there were a lot of colorful macarons. the Amanda asked me some things like where I live. she&apos;s much louder than me. nita told her that she&apos;s cute, and she responded by telling nita that she thinks she&apos;s cute too.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">nita said she&apos;d assist me this time, picking which cards to play, but then went to play another game instead. so the Amanda said she&apos;d help me instead. I&apos;m already reading it too hard. I shudder at the thought of what my body language must have been and what my voice sounded like. she always made encouraging okay&apos;s no matter what my decision was whenever it was my turn.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">nita interrupted the game to tell us that she was going to the korean bbq place down the plaza. I had said I wanted to eat there, so it was a valid excuse to leave the game. she asked to add the Amanda on facebook, and then the Amanda asked if I wanted to add her too. why did she ask me that? so I have her on facebook and I&apos;ll try messaging her tomorrow maybe. nita asked me if I like Amanda, but didn&apos;t really pay attention for me to answer.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">the korean bbq place was the same one that I went to with Angie&apos;s group, now over two years ago. I felt much more at ease with nita all throughout the afternoon, with very little of the anxiety and tension that I&apos;d felt during the previous few times.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">this weekend last year, the last one before christmas/eve, I was already on my way home. had everything packed up. had a good time to look forward to. there&apos;s only one week until christmas and I&apos;ve felt zero christmas or holiday spirits anywhere. no xmas music fix to be had. my favorite time of year seems to have hardly happened at all this year.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">this was a socially productive sunday, and I am glad that nita made the effort to pull me out today. how did this happen? this is closer to how normal people spend their weekends?</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-19 t</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">yesterday nita again asked me if I like the Amanda and whether or not I&apos;d rather go see the new star wars movie alone with her. I&apos;m certain that that got me thinking more about her than I otherwise would have. not sure exactly how strange the Amanda may have perceived my messaging her about seeing the movie. she wasn&apos;t interested but did want to get dinner with &quot;Everyone&quot; later during the week. what&apos;s that all about?</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I wore the skull embroidered blouson and of course nita and her brother liked it. the theater was called cinebistro and was located in a large plaza adjacent to a costco that I&apos;d been to with my parents one time at the beginning of one of my school years.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">after the weekend, I was pretty much completely comfortable around them both now, so I was able to relax and enjoy the experience. it was probably a good thing that the Amanda wasn&apos;t here, since that would have distracted heavily from the movie. I paid over $53 for food that was good, but not worth that much. the movie was a fun watch. the Amanda said she&apos;ll let me know about whatever dinner event may be going on.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-21 r</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">Amanda routinely takes a long time to answer messages, but at least she gets back to me when she says she will. I had no idea how big of a group she had invited, but it turned out to be just be her and one other person. a guy, someone I had seen at the board game meetup last weekend. I forgot his name, but heard Amanda address him as a &quot;Theo&quot; or something.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I got to the restaurant, barcelona, first and had to wait about fifteen minutes for them because they were in traffic. it was a slightly upscale place. I watched a lot of girls in dresses walk in with guys. and there was a valet service. when Amanda came with Theo she simply said &quot;hey&quot; like it was no big deal and I followed them inside. I was dressed alright, and didn&apos;t feel too uncomfortable among them. I didn&apos;t find it terribly difficult to talk to them. somehow. although it was a little loud and they had trouble hearing me at times. I tried to not give too much of my attention to Amanda. we ordered various bits of food and it wasn&apos;t bad but it wasn&apos;t particularly stellar. I emphasized the experience. tonight, I was one of the people socializing at night, that I had previously driven by repeatedly, wondering how to even get there.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I wasn&apos;t desperately fishing. someone like Amanda for sure has a large social circle, and I feel like just another blip. she mentioned multiple best friends and childhood friends, and I kept comparing her to myself and my nonexistent circle of friends. she and Theo kept referencing other members of their own circle. Amanda and I have a few mutual friends, including monique, who she&apos;s actually known since middle or high school. also we added each other on instagram.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I forgot to order a mojito before we got the check and walked over to jeni&apos;s ice cream. the ice cream place I visited once before, with alice, in early 2016. there I mostly listened to Theo and Amanda talking about her dog, a chihuahua. I don&apos;t like chihuahuas, and ended up letting my fear of offending her hold me back from fully expressing this opinion. I got three &quot;half scoops&quot; of ice cream but it sure looked like a lot more than half scoops to me. it was roughly three times as much as Theo got, and he only asked for one full scoop. I enjoyed the ice cream enough.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">Amanda plays LoL and on the walk back to barcelona I think she half-heartedly invited me to her house to play with her/watch her play. I wouldn&apos;t quite have been up for it anyway. apparently she and Theo met some time in july. the farewell was quick and simple. he got in her car and they drove off. the valet driver who came up with my car seemed to wait for a tip for a second, but walked off before I could search the center console and I didn&apos;t say anything either.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">Theo is 31 and Amanda is my age. he isn&apos;t really awkward in general, but is a little awkwardly nice.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I&apos;m being more open about myself and my feelings to nita now, and she still seems pretty warm. I&apos;m basically admitting that I like Amanda and she&apos;s being pretty supportive. I&apos;ve gone from terrified that she may be into me, to comfortable enough to admit things like this to her. admit that I&apos;ve never been in a relationship. she said that that&apos;s surprising because she thinks I&apos;m cute, but also not surprising because of my demeanor. I don&apos;t pay enough attention to the way other people may perceive me.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">Theo isn&apos;t as attuned to all the modern social networking stuff, and Amanda showed us a few screenshots of messages she&apos;s received from creepy guys.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-22 f</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div><br style="font-family: Segoe UI;"/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I had resigned from any hope of carrying out my personally traditional road trip home this winter, and spent the morning scrambling to look up flights. a pleasant and strangely not unexpected surprise awaited me when I finally went to work at 11 am and saw that my request for next week off was apparently approved. it was some genuine happiness.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">so I did nothing at work for a few hours, worked out a bit at the crc, and spent all day packing and organizing. some things could be skipped. I won&apos;t be bringing my computer home this time. there wouldn&apos;t be enough time, anyway. I don&apos;t want the sense of panic, but it never does go as planned anyway. this year things will be slightly different, but there should still be unique events to remember.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">monique and I reconnected briefly today, before our exchange abruptly stopped. Amanda doesn&apos;t say much to me. I don&apos;t think she&apos;s thinking of me much.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><b>12-25 m</b></div></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">today is christmas. it&apos;s nighttime now. today was christmas?</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">I know I&apos;ve been saying this for years now, but somehow it still feels notable that the holiday spirits are completely gone. like even more completely gone than the last couple years. at least then I&apos;d have a week at home before christmas day. this year&apos;s christmas eve was the sunday I reached home.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">I noticed something about the trip back. sure it was short again. but this time I seemed to recognize that it was a little less enjoyable overall. sore butt from sitting in the car. many of the ocremix tracks I play are beginning to get boring. disorientation at the hotel. I may need to cut the road trips to once a year instead of twice. I have less than one week before I need to be on the road again, so there&apos;s little time to relax. another difference is the stop I made at a mall in delaware.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">mom told me about our traditional house party at michael&apos;s and tracy&apos;s house, and I reluctantly agreed to go. I brought a 6-pack of sweetwater blue again. there were several college aged girls there I didn&apos;t recognize; I figured they were tracy&apos;s friends. I wanted to act sociable and say to her something about introducing me to them. I was wearing my new black denim jacket. I never formally introduced myself to or greeted any of them. as much as I would have liked to talk to some of them, esp. the ones closest to my age, I never went out of my way to make anything happen. there was another guy there who looked familiar who I know I&apos;ve seen before, and he recognized me too. I don&apos;t know/remember his name.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">overall I felt a couple things. one, that I had more fun there than I was expecting to, and actually kind of wanted to talk a little bit to some of the people; and two, I was a little low-key smug and snobby. the jacket was part of it. but also there were people like charles and the guy who remained apart from everyone playing his switch, not acknowledging or being acknowledged by anyone, who I kept feeling better than. maybe the girl in the green light-up sweater picked up something like that. I didn&apos;t get a good vibe from them. I don&apos;t mean a bad vibe. I mean I don&apos;t think my presence affected anyone in a positive way.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">I tried to not message nita too much to feel less alone. it felt slightly strange updating her on my trip progress. I&apos;m used to being very alone in the car.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>12-27 w</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><div style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">so yesterday I hung out with</span><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">DOOGIE and his friend Dave (Sir Boolean), who I finally saw in person. I didn&apos;t really have any expectations for what he would look like, but it definitely was not that.</span><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">DOOGIE had once described him as a chubby asian guy, which isn&apos;t inaccurate, but still his appearance was so unexpected. he looked more classically asian than</span><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">DOOGIE, that&apos;s for sure. a chubby, acne scarred face and even smaller eyes. his mannerisms more or less matched the way his voice sounds online, a bit shy and awkward. he laughs whenever I talk shit to</span><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">DOOGIE. stands with his hands in his pockets, scarf bundled around him. I judged their dress. I wonder if mine stood out to them.</span></div><div style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">DOOGIE himself looked somehow younger and older at the same time. his hair was cut short this time, which made him look kind of younger, but also made it more evident that he was in his 30&apos;s. Dave and I both talked mostly to him, rather than each other. whenever he left us temporarily, we never said anything to each other. I thought about asking him basic questions like how he came to know</span><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">DOOGIE, but never did.</span></div><div style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">I ran into some issues with my new iPhone so they waited for me while I spent some time at the apple store. one of the problems wasn&apos;t resolved after I sat down with one of the employees, and</span><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">DOOGIE was much more emphatic and assertive about talking to someone and asking for a replacement than I was. I felt weak in that regard and it&apos;s the one thing I can learn from him.</span></div><div style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">he still likes bringing up girls. asking me if I got any girls&apos; numbers at the meetups I&apos;ve gone to. pointing out a cute girl here or there. what&apos;s the point?</span></div><div style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">we didn&apos;t end up seated at the restaurant until after 7 pm. I drove them both there. Dave knows at least a little chinese and</span><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">DOOGIE ordered off the menu in english. we played his game that he has on his phone, word cookies. somehow he never realized that correctly formed words show up in the list of completed words in alphabetical order, which I noticed right away. we continued playing while eating. he never tried a single pork bun.</span></div><div style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">things fell apart afterward,</span><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">DOOGIE wanted to see the new jumanji movie, a comedy, something to make him laugh, he said. except because he absolutely insisted on a theater with reclining seats, we weren&apos;t able to agree on any nearby theater. I was not willing to drive 40 minutes further up north just to see a movie that wouldn&apos;t even start for another hour after getting there. I drove them back to the mall and we ended up sitting in my car for over half an hour not getting anywhere. I turned the engine off and he said it was too cold, despite being from new york.</span></div><div style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">he then tried suggesting that I actually drive all the way up to the city with him and Dave and go over to his house to game some, maybe even crash there for the night. I thought he was slightly insane. he invited me to come over again on thursday (tomorrow), and when he asked me again today I said no. if he&apos;s upset, I don&apos;t know it.</span></div><div style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">again, tomorrow is thursday. this year&apos;s winter break is short and doesn&apos;t feel terribly memorable so far. I haven&apos;t talked to nita much, but Amanda messaged me tonight asking how NJ is.</span></div></div><div><br style="font-family: Segoe UI;"/></div><div><hr/><b>12-29 f</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">I feel the need to inscribe some words, but this is like sticking my fingers down my throat to make myself vomit. I don&apos;t really have any thoughts about the end of this year. no holiday spirit and little time spent outside the house. very few photos taken. not much to remember. doesn&apos;t really...feel like winter.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">leaving a day early with the family once again, and planning to spend new year&apos;s at the hotel. I&apos;ll need to be back at work immediately after.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">in 2017 I felt my first video-induced ASMR tingles. in 2018 I&apos;d like to further distance myself from retail therapy.</span></div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<!DOCTYPE en-note SYSTEM "http://xml.evernote.com/pub/enml2.dtd"><en-note><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-2 n</span></div><div><br /></div><div>as I ended up not running yesterday morning or going out to dinner with the group later, I spent the entire yesterday doing nothing and am about to do the same again today. full of energy in the morning, that gets wasted throughout the day, achieving nothing. it's hard to imagine that I once spend every weekend, every week, like this. now it makes me very antsy, but it's never enough to force me off and out.</div><div><br /></div><div>I was thinking I should make an effort to see Shelly this weekend, but she says she's busy working on multiple final school reports as well as studying for a test. apparently she didn't do well on her obesity exam, the one she skipped studying for when I stayed the night. I'm hoping she's being genuine. I also need to remember to make an effort to be Emotionally Available.</div><div><br /></div><div>the first night I went to be by myself, after the night at Shelly's apartment, it felt like things were going back to normal. normal to be alone. I'm so, SO used to this, it's impossible to imagine anything else. where are the romantic feelings? how do I peel away the walls and allow myself to be vulnerable. how do I not be alone.</div><div><br /></div><div>it's jarring seeing the christmas decorations in my building's lobby and mailbox/elevator area. I'd forgotten about them showing up at the end of the year.</div><div><br /></div><hr /><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-4 t</span></div></div><div><br /></div><div>in another rare twist yesterday, a Tarina, with whom I had matched on cmb a few days ago and whom I had initially liked nearly months ago, messaged me first. I waited until late this afternoon to reply because of how busy with work I was yesterday.</div><div><br /></div><div>am I just wired to be alone? or is it just that I've been alone for so long that anything otherwise is so anxiety-inducing? even though I had initially felt perfectly compatible with Shelly, the thought of being with her is starting to make me almost sick the same way that thinking about Jordan did. the thought of someone else wanting me, liking me, depending on me. it feels so wrong.</div><div><br /></div><div>last night I saw her for the first time in a week. she'd been hanging out at lenox with a friend and directed me to pick her up at, unexpectedly, a place near lindbergh. when I got there, there were a lot of people walking about, with others holding flashing red wands to sort of direct traffic. turns out passion city church is like right there.</div><div><br /></div><div>I thought there was some tension between us initially, because she kept changing her mind about her plans and when she wanted to meet up. but it was soon gone. she'd eaten dinner already and I didn't know what I wanted to get, and chipotle was already closed. so, we ended up going back to my place, and I ordered uber eats on her phone. we started becoming comfortable with touching each other again. the chinese food I ordered was slightly better than expected. she showed me the cosmetic products she bought at the mall. according to her, it's my butt, which is big, my posture, and the way I walk that all contribute towards me looking gay. I mentioned Nita also having asked me if I'm gay, and said she was just a friend after Shelly picked up on the fact that it was a girl who'd asked.</div><div><br /></div><div>I still didn't have an extra toothbrush for her to use.</div><div><br /></div><div>she was bundled up under the sheets by the time I finished showering. she still has a really bad cough, and kept coughing throughout the night. I never knew what, if anything, I could do to alleviate it. she was worried that I'd be upset at the disruption in my sleep that she caused, and I probably didn't do enough to reassure her that I ultimately didn't mind.</div><div><br /></div><div>the Ashley who's my neighbor who I've heard four times having sex came out the door of her unit just as Shelly and I were leaving mine. we shared an elevator ride.</div><div><br /></div><div>today I got my file write function working in go and Blessed told me once again that he was proud of me, and also praised himself for quickly figuring out a solution to an issue I was having trouble fixing. he's also kind of frustrated with Ben, who's been taking a while to fix the device write stuff. it's becoming less strange mentioning work-related things here. the Gorm arrived at the office today, shortly after Ben left. I heard Blessed chiding him to Gorm behind his back.</div><div><br /></div><div>I met with Shelly again this evening after we parted earlier this morning. we went on our promised ikea trip, where she ended up buying a small lamp to use as secondary lighting for her room. we also got dinner at the food court. this was definitely the sort of thing I would fantasized about in the past, enjoying a simple thing with a partner. instead I was *still* as Anxious as usual, and also she still has a really bad cough.</div><div><br /></div><div>in the parking lot, she noticed that my car’s front tires are extremely bald, and urged me to get them replaced because driving with such tires is dangerous. I interpreted it as concern for me.</div><div><br /></div><div>I hung out with her in her room afterwards, helping her assemble her lamp. helping her book an appointment on her school campus clinic to see if she can get help with her cough. she played modern hip-hop music on a bluetooth speaker. we held each other and she swayed a bit, almost dancing but not quite. she loved her new lamp. I didn't want to kiss her as much this time. things could start fading from both sides if I keep moving to hug, kiss, and touch her but hold back from going all the way. problem is I'll get stuck in my own  head, as per usual. I elected to not spend the night at her place this time. she asked me several times, "why me?" and I more or less pretended to not understand, only because I wasn't strictly speaking 100% certain of what she means. but I do know what she means, and the real reason I'm unwilling to answer is because deep down I must know it isn't right. it still isn't right.</div><div><br /></div><hr /><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-5 w</span></div></div><div><br /></div><div>RJ or someone was playing christmas music in the office today, driving Ben and Gorm crazy. I didn't mind it at all and kind of liked it; the only thing I was unsure about was it potentially affecting my association of that music with home.</div><div><br /></div><div>I asked Shelly if she would like to "meet some of my friends" but she responded by saying that it was too fast. I decided that I agreed, particularly because there would be more people at the "party" this weekend than I'd initially thought. the thought of mixing her with the existing running group makes me uncomfortable. it'd clash with the mode I go into with her, due to english not being her first language. the mode that makes me feel like I'm getting away with the moments of poor communication. such when we talk on the phone and don't understand each other, and spend several moments going what, huh. like tonight. she called me, I think just wanting to talk. and I had nothing to say. not only that, but I didn't really want to talk to her. granted, that is my default, but she isn't able to bend it. wouldn't someone who I truly like be able to bend it? she should definitely be able to tell that I'm not feeling it 100%. I'm still too confused, still too unsettled by the thought of someone wanting me. what if I'm doomed to live alone forever? one of the worst parts relating to this is that I've been watching porn again.</div><div><br /></div><hr /><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-6 r</span></div><div><br /></div><div>I expect I'm confusing Shelly with whatever behavior patterns I'm exhibiting, but in actuality I'm the one who's confused. confused about why I'm so stressed out thinking about her, when she isn't waving any red flags. why I feel so uncomfortable, why I've been turning to porn instead of holding out for her, why I don't want her more. any and all feels towards her. she called again earlier today and, after talking for a bit, asked me if I had anything to say or share. I wasn't sure if she was hinting towards something specific, but I realized, after she reiterated this, that I don't say enough. that's been a recurring thing with me, and it's a problem...she sounded slightly sad as she simply stated that she was hanging up, and I simply said okay. I felt like I was really letting her down. and I want to make it up to her, for this perceived lack of emotional warmth, but...it just wouldn't be completely genuine, would it? if one or both of have to be actively working to maintain feelings where they are lacking. she's leaving next week with her korean girl friend on a trip up north to boston, new york, and d.c., and isn't coming back until the day before I'm planning to leave for home for two weeks. will this fragile relationship withstand a month-long separation?</div><div><br /></div><div>work has somehow been somewhat less stressful lately. so far I've been able to figure things out, and have been reasonably productive. I'm not nervous around Gorm. today Ben asked to stop with the Zach jokes, and he explained during our lunch that it was because he'd been so stressed and frustrated that he's taking so long to figure things out. feeling dread and anxiety towards the daily standup meeting, and that maybe he understands Zach a bit better; maybe Zach too was just frequently unable to figure things out. he certainly had no one to help him.</div><div><br /></div><hr /><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-9 n</span></div><div><br /></div><div>sit down to write about another series of events.</div><div><br /></div><div>this is going at all like how I'd always imagined it. on friday, I mentioned to &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE, who wanted to play l4d2, that I was having someone over soon, and his response to ask me what time my gf is coming over. of course, I don't think about Shelly that way, and I don't know if that's even a possibility anymore. something that disturbed me, but somehow not as much as one might expect, was one of the avatars on a chat application that she had open on her computer when I was openly looking at her screen. I could clearly see in that thumbnail the same picture as one of the ones the "Tarina" on cmb used on her profile. which would explain her late match and message last week. I can only operate under the assumption that the two of them are friends and were working together on this, but I don't feel guilty since I didn't do anything wrong. I don't even feel betrayed, or let down in any way, because of my lack of true feelings towards Shelly currently. she wanted to shower with me, but I couldn't do it this time. she couldn't her ears when I told her I didn't have a hair dryer. she slept over again, and once more (actually, twice more) attempted to *initiate* sex with me. and when I inevitably shut it down again, she had to ask me, bluntly and straightforwardly, why I wouldn't have sex with her. there's so much emotional blockage going on here that's impossible for me to dissect. everything feels wrong. my own communication was dismal; I literally said nothing as I struggled to find words that I could possibly use to reply.</div><div><br /></div><div>on saturday morning we had a brunch at an egg harbor cafe, where I noticed that every single person was white except a few of the servers. the food was average. we each bought a breakfast and drink and the bill was split down the middle, which was unfair to Shelly because my drink cost $0.30 more than hers. we spent the afternoon at target and walmart, where she spent some time looking at burt's bees products and spent over $200 on vitamin gummies to ship overseas to her family in taiwan. while we were fooling around in her room again, I ended up taking the plunge and revealed to her that I've never had sex before, which hopefully should make her understand why I'm so hesitant. she didn't believe me at first, and also said that based on how I kiss her, she wouldn't have guessed that I'm inexperienced. I expect that she'll tell her friends about it now, which I don't really care about. even with all the physical affection she gives me, I feel no different from how I did before her.</div><div><br /></div><div>I arrived at zyka late, after everyone else except for cody. the only chair remaining was at the far end of the table, but with dorothy's help, I was able to squeeze in next to Jay...and Ben. Barb was there with the lowest cut top I've ever seen her in; she had brought her Chris. dorothy and Heather, Jay and Ian, David, and Ben. cody appeared and asked dorothy what to order because he didn't know. I think I'd kind of done the same. coincidentally, the Vinson was sitting with his friend group at a table near ours. I confirmed to dorothy that I'd spent the earlier afternoon with my "you-know-who". didn't really feel like talking to anybody else while I was eating. I heard David say to Barb that he was happy because "when [he] woke up, the world was still here, and [we] were in it." Barb said that she wished she could be like that. I rode with dorothy to the next stop, kimball house...</div><div><br /></div><div>where Claire was present. with her help, we were able to squeeze into a corner of the bar to hang out before our table reservation time. looking at the drink menu, I had no clue what I might like or dislike on there, so I let dorothy order me a rum/coke. dorothy told a story about some stingy people she had lunch at an expensive restaurant with in new york, and David and cody became unusually heated.</div><div><br /></div><div>at the table, Barb asked me what I've been up to, with dorothy hinting towards Shelly. I didn't feel comfortable telling any of them about it. dorothy mentioned that her birthday was on monday, which I'd had no idea about at all. I had little to add to any of the conversations about dating. cody was slightly drunk. I didn't order another drink or dessert. fortunately, cody, David, and dorothy were down to leave at the same time I was. cody and some others hugged Claire before leaving. when I saw cody hug her, I pretended to not notice and turned to walk away without ever saying anything to her. I can certainly see how that'd give her an inaccurate and negative perception of me.</div><div><br /></div><div>on the way back, cody mentioned never having spent the night with his Brittany yet. that prompted me to decline Shelly's invitation to stay overnight at her place. although I'm probably going to yes to her reinvite tonight. because I feel obligated to.</div><div><br /></div><hr /><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-13 r</span></div></div><div><br /></div><div>on tuesday, half the company stayed in the office until about 11:30 pm at night scrambling to finish implementing all the features and stuff we needed to do. so it was too late for me to get ready and stay over at Shelly's place again, which she had asked me to do. because she'd be leaving for her trip to boston the next day, I still offered to drive back to her place, even after driving home first, despite how late it was. it was she who pointed out that that wouldn't be a good idea.</div><div><br /></div><div>wednesday was arguably even more stressful, initially. although as I'm writing this now on thursday night, I can't even remember what I was working on. I overheard Gorm telling Blessed that he was impressed with me and Ben. Blessed seemed satisfied, satisfied that he could safely up his expectations from now on. however we still ended up failing to meet the deadline to release something to NCR. Anthony was getting annoyed because no one was confident in whether or not we could finish completely. I, he, and the Robbie were the only ones who stayed outside the conference room while the rest of the company was in there conducting their white elephant gift exchange.</div><div><br /></div><div>the "party" at top golf</div><div><br /></div><div>I really didn't want to go at first because of how exhausted I felt from all the work the past few days, but miraculously I started feeling better later in the evening and decided to go. I'd never been to topgolf before, nor had I ever swung a golf club in my life. I was nervous about having to focus on feeling comfortable in this unfamiliar environment, but the familiar faces helped a bit. as well as the food, for I hadn't eaten all day. I was apprehensive about trying my hand at golf, and missed my first few swings. a lot of us weren't so great. Kyle gave me some guidance. Ben brought his wife Kara, who looks a different every time I see her. she was really friendly. Michael also gave me some tips on the golfing. I'm sure he and Gorm were drunk. I broke away from most of the crowd and kept practicing on my own, eventually hitting some decent shots. just before we all left, Blessed came up to me and told me that he and a bunch of others were going to go to a "strip joint" and that I was welcome to join. I initially had no intention of going, perhaps partly because of Shelly, but then changed my mind. Robbie was the only person to not show up.</div><div><br /></div><div>Richard, RJ, Kyle, Rashida, Brenda and Iwere packed into Blessed's car. I had severely underestimated the former three's levels of drunkenness. Blessed blasted african music while Rashida navigated us to a club called onyx. Shelly called me on the way there, and I didn't pick up. in the parking lot, I saw a girl park and walk in. she must be a worker there. Richard drunkenly paid my cash-only entrance fee. the club was slow and empty, with shitty loud music. I didn't believe I'd have a good time there, but Brenda bought me drink so I stuck around as I now had something to sip on. the girls appeared and began talking to us, and to me. it was again a process of breaking out and becoming relaxed enough to just talk. at least, when I didn't feel like talking, I could just stare off and say nothing and not feel bad about it. I saw the other girls talking to the other guys and there wasn't anything to be jealous of in this case. Blessed expressed frustration towards me, saying again that I need to get laid. there were very few people here, and a small group of the girls were gathered in a corner of the bar, one of them eating some take-out from a styrofoam container. Blessed stopped talking to girls and just say by himself in a corner. I sat nearby, and when a girl approached us, he told her to dance for me. she removed what little was wearing and did so in front of me, blankly smiling at me with her face caked in makeup. when I couldn't/wouldn't pay her for the dance, her mask rapidly evaporated and she became visibly upset and annoyed. it was slightly jarring how quickly she dropped her act. in the end, Blessed paid her $20.</div><div><br /></div><div>Richard had ordered a hookah that cost however much. Rashida and Brenda hung around a pool table. Brenda seemed into some of the strippers, talking closely with one and tossing singles at another who was dancing on the tiny stage surrounded by nobody. Anthony showed up after a couple hours. I had a conversation with a drunk Anthony about my tastes, relationships, and past experience. Jordan and Shelly have provided me a platform on which I can stand and technically not be lying about certain things. I said that I don't have a girlfriend, that Shelly isn't one right now. just to be on the safe side. I told him about her, and showed him a photo of us too. he asked if we'd done it yet and I said no. I also had a conversation with a drunk Michael, who surprisingly showed up and was way more talkative with me than he had ever been. I ran into him again in the bathroom this morning, and we were conspicuously quiet. we left the club at about 3 am. I had pretty much been completely sober the whole time.</div><div><br /></div><div>Gorm left this afternoon. the rest of the day was normal. Blessed referred to the stripper incident from yesterday, and I harshly described her as having stared at me with empty eyes, which he and RJ found funny.</div><div><br /></div><div>Shelly's been calling me a lot, and I realized that I'm actually not looking forward to talking on the phone with her potentially once a day while I'm at home. since I won't see her until at least the first weekend of january. or will I? she called me this morning asking why I didn't pick up last night. this night, after answering her second facetime call after missing her first, she again asked me why I didn't call back sooner. she's altered her plans and I think she wants to stay in washington through christmas, and wanted me to stop there on my way up to nj...for 2 or 3 days. I quietly made it known that I was unwilling, and she became visibly unhappy.</div><div><br /></div><hr /><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-16 n</span></div></div><div><br /></div><div>it's that time of year again.</div><div><br /></div><div>hard to believe there's (now) less than one week until the coveted road trip home. I reread my corresponding journal entries from past years, and I'd forgotten just how long I'd been going on for, about how quickly time is passing and how unbelievable it is that I'm about to hit the road to home yet again. each time, I want it perfect. each time, I try to make all the necessary preparations ahead of time so things can run smoothly the morning I go. we'll see just well they go this year. there's always the nagging anxiety of not having time to prepare and pack everything perfectly before I have to leave.</div><div><br /></div><div>yesterday morning I arrived some 40 minutes late to the park. cody, Barb, and Jay were already finished, waiting by the normal meetup spot as I was only beginning my run. I pushed through two laps around the park, and on my way to jason's deli, encountered a trio of white people who greeted me in chinese. one of them, a man with an even, quiet voice, handed me a small pamphlet and told me I'm welcome to join whatever chinese bible study group they have going on. I met the others were at the deli, and Barb said "hi friend" as she gave me a hug. she asked me just how far I had run, but I was so preoccupied with telling them about the white people who talked to me in chinese that I ignored her question. she left with her Chris while I hung out at caribou coffee with cody and Jay for a while. we talked about work and winter break. I skipped jiu jitsu for the last time this year. in the afternoon, I went back to the perimeter costco with the wheel lock key I'd found in my car's trunk, and successfully had my car tires finally replaced.</div><div><br /></div><div>Hannah messaged me on friday, I guess mainly to tell me that she just started going to bjj again. that was it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Shelly and I have been talking nearly every night, and I'm trying to love her. she gives me updates on what she did with her friends that day. yesterday she described a couple incidents where she and her friends were getting harassed by people, which worried me, and I didn't know what to say, other than to tell her to be careful. she's told me that she misses me and wants to hear my voice. she bought me a small gift, a pig-shaped usb attachment thing. she becomes upset when I don't call her. I expect she gets anxious when it seems like I don't reciprocate her attention enough. I don't want to seem too distant or unavailable. but I still don't want to stop in washington to meet with her on my way up to nj.</div><div><br /></div><div>I had dinner with dorothy at shoya tonight, and we talked for a little bit about me and Shelly. she offered some new perspectives for me to think about, but I don't remember what they are. pointed out that I don't know enough about Shelly's school/work life, because I had never asked her about her timeline. also I'm not sure of dorothy realizes that I'm a virgin, and I still don't have it in me to confirm with her whether or not she knows. I told her about how I'd admitted to shelly that I'm a virgin, but I don't know if dorothy misunderstood and thought I was talking about merely telling Shelly that I haven't been in a relationship before.</div><div><br /></div><hr /><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-17 m</span></div><div><br /></div><div>today Blessed approved my two-week vacation next week. Anthony had indeed bought two of those usb-c to hdmi cables I'd asked for. two new people joined the company.</div><div><br /></div><div>Shelly and I talked again tonight. she had basically gotten scammed by some scummy guys who messed up her and her friends' plans to visit ellis island/statue of liberty. she felt stupid that she'd fallen for it, and began crying. I didn't know how to comfort her.</div><div><br /></div><div>she still keeps asking me to visit her in washington, d.c. on my way home, and I'm still afraid to explicitly say no, instead remaining wordless. I need to definitively say no, or else I'll be letting her make me feel guilty, which would leave a sour taste in my mouth for the duration of the journey.</div><div><br /></div><hr /><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-18 t</span></div></div><div><br /></div><div>unbelievably, Shelly missed another flight with her friend, this time to washington, d.c. I did my best to listen and to be who she needed. she's now accepted that I don't want to stop there. and told me that she wants to hug me. I keep thinking about the animoji she sent me while in nyc, in which she talks about getting hot dogs.</div><div><br /></div><div>today Ben admitted to me that he used to be an alcoholic. the Gorm sent a series of angry messages in slack, which got Blessed annoyed as well.</div><div><br /></div><hr /><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-21 f</span></div></div><div><br /></div><div>if this keeps up, Shelly and I won't last much longer. she's always wanting to call and talk, and I can't keep up with it. I'm starting to almost dread awaiting her inevitable call, and it's taking its toll, and I'm not adequately explaining to her how I feel. I'm not even sure what I'm feeling. I answer her calls out of a feeling of obligation, but then have nothing to say. which then frustrates her, as I'm just sitting there waiting for her to say something. and feeling like I can't simply admit that I don't have anything to say, because it'll add to the feeling that I'm not enough. I'm afraid that I'll end up letting her slip away, this chance, this opportunity, which is a selfish thought. but I can't help it.</div><div><br /></div><hr /><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-22 s</span></div></div><div><br /></div><div>despite leaving at a reasonable time, this year holds the record for the latest arrival to the richmond hotel, at 20 minutes past midnight. I was further behind schedule than I'd anticipated. also screwed up dinner plans. so despite the careful initial planning, with the packing and cleaning beginning as early as this wednesday, things still didn't go so smoothly, and it'll be a long while until I get another redo.</div><div><br /></div><div>some of the scenery had changed. most of the median in the i-95 stretch in south carolina leading up to the peachoid was lined with concrete barriers instead of the usual wire fence. at the rest stop with the tall, thin trees, the lakeshore was gone. the water came all the way up to the pine needle-covered ground, with no red dirt to walk upon at all. I facetimed shelly here.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm typing this now at nearly 1 am on the work-issued macbook pro, streaming 106.7 from iheart radio. hungry, because I didn't eat well. things should be simpler and smoother tomorrow; I may elect to go the original route with i-95 and the nj turnpike, even though there will be tolls. skipping the delaware mall for the return trip, to get shelly's airpods. I'm getting bored of more and more of the ocremix tracks. the new tires improved the ride quality considerably; it would have been an unimaginable nightmare if I hadn't gotten them replaced. I had small bits of contact with dorothy and cody on the way as well. last year all I had was Nita.</div><div><br /></div><hr /><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-23 n</span></div><div><br /></div><div>in addition, the hotel breakfast menu has changed. the same guy has been working there for 4+ years though.</div><div><br /></div><div>the trip continues today.</div><div><br /></div><hr /><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-25 t</span></div><div><br /></div><div>these moments with the family in our bustling house will only become ever fewer and further in between. eventually, like everything else, they will cease as phases end.</div><div><br /></div><div>today is Christmas and thus the last day for 106.7 to be playing holiday music nonstop. it's day 2 of 12 (12 days...of Christmas...?) and have I been making the most of my time here so far? yesterday felt "productive" so, because I organized all of my unwanted clothing that I'm keeping here, as well as all of the empty product boxes I've been hoarding for years.</div><div><br /></div><div>and also attended a christmas eve party at the house of, it turns out, the three sisters who spent thanksgiving night at our house. somehow I correctly deduced that after my dad mentioned that it'd be at the "girls'" house. their names are Samantha, Emily, and Jennifer. I was the same reclusive self as I always am around people like them, doubly so when I'm surrounded by family. the three of them stuck together and my brother stuck by me, none of us willing to talk to the others. I tried, and did a little better than I would have in past years. michael arrived, followed by a Jason and a Jessica, both of whom I've seen before, likely at a previous one of these gatherings but I can't recall which year. Jason's the talkative one and Jessica was noticeably quiet and aloof. they were siblings. tracy arrived soon after. and then the usual Jessie.</div><div><br /></div><div>it's the same every time, they gather round to play a group game and I want to avoid the interaction, but end up getting roped in and loosening up enough to enjoy myself. enough to not want to retreat by myself to text or call shelly, or think about escaping back home. we played one night ultimate werewolf, which I believe I last engaged in back in 2016 at lisa's house with alex and alice. and then moved on "fishbowl" which I think we played at michael's house last year. the festivities lasted until well after midnight, which meant Shelly may have been waiting for a phone call from me which would never come. I was surprised with myself at how decent a time I was having.</div><div><br /></div><div>Jennifer is the slightly sassy one of the three, while Emily and Samantha ("Sammy") are more reserved. it's an attractive quality to me, but Sammy is apparently still in school. Jessica was the quietest one there, often retreating to a corner by herself, where I wouldn't notice for a while. she and Jason played the new smash bros. game on my brother's switch for a while. Jason was outgoing and okay. and the rest are already known.</div><div><br /></div><div>I said a verbal "bye" this time when we left. I won't daydream about them anymore.</div><div><br /></div><div>the second leg of the trip on sunday was also fairly rough. lots of traffic patches, some new routes and bathroom stops that I won't remember. I can never pay enough attention to the ocremix songs anymore, and felt the temptation to skip more and more of them. every once in a while I'd update dorothy and cody, but dorothy consistently somehow misunderstood and thought I was further along my route than I actually was. I fell far enough behind that I didn't get home until past 7. the sun had set before I reached the delaware bridge, and I drove the entire stretch of turnpike in darkness. my butt didn't get as sore from sitting, though.</div><div><br /></div><div>it's a quarter to 5 and already dark outside. the earliest I remember noticing just how much earlier the sun sets here than in atlanta was in 2016.</div><div><br /></div><div>Shelly left washington and is back in her room in atlanta today. turns out she senses that I don't like talking on the phone too much, and seemed to want to make sure that I'm not feeling forced to. what's the best way to handle this? she asked me if I got a present to deliver to her when I got back. I had nothing planned, but may need to come up with something, since she got me that little pig usb attachment. she's also noticed that I frequently don't keep my word with regards to calling and staying over. I hope I don't screw this up because of too much unwillingness to change my single habits. I just feel overwhelmed from her asking to talk on the phone all the time.</div><div><br /></div><div>the razer blade sits unopened on the dining table, and I'll probably end up leaving it alone. I don't see myself taking the time to set up, download, and install everything, only to wipe it all barely a week later.</div><div><br /></div><hr /><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">12-30 n</span></div><div><br /></div><div>we have now passed this vacation's midpoint. from here on, six nights remain.</div><div><br /></div><div>it's new year's eve eve, and somewhat notable this year is the near-total absence of any sort of countdown in my head. then again, it may have already been like this for some time, considering how often I find that my recurring thoughts, which feel recent, have actually been going on for years.</div><div><br /></div><div>yesterday I finally spent a day out of the house, or most of one. we didn't leave for new york until past 1 pm, parking in my dad's workplace parking garage and taking a path train into the city. I'd forgotten that we had that arrangement now; we'd done it last year too. I continue to be unfamiliar with the streets, since every time I'm there it's with family and we just follow my dad around. my brother's been here several times on his own now, so he now has more familiarity than me. I called shelly at the uniqlo and we talked for about ten minutes. she told me that she wanted to go out with me to a lot of places, but I never have the time.</div><div><br /></div><div>after uniqlo, we ate at the sichuan restaurant where &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE had joined us two years ago, then went to the muji store. there I bought a bunch of small polyethylene liquid travel containers, and two little porcelain toothbrush stands in blue and pink. I intend the pink one to be a small gift for shelly, though I don't know how well-received it might be; I'm still mad at myself for passing up the opportunity to pick up what would have been a perfect gift for her: a pink pig beanie with hanging pom poms. it was dark out when we left the store. there were insane crowds at the intersections in the blocks surrounding rockefeller center and wherever that light-show-on-the-wall thing is. one cop was losing his patience and speaking vehemently to someone in the crowd; I imagine how stressed he must have been and how we were all being herded like animals. I took an obligatory picture of the christmas tree before we left to visit a korean dessert place that my brother knew, called grace street. there we bought some korean donuts and vanilla ice cream. as we were walking to and from there, I kept an eye out for any place that might be selling the pig beanie, but never saw it again. there were a lot of people selling fake gucci and supreme bags and wallets, laying them out on the ground.</div><div><br /></div><div>I decided to never text &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE that I was in Manhattan.</div><div><br /></div><div>~</div><div><br /></div><div>more recurring thoughts:</div><div><br /></div><div>if I drive home again as planned next winter, I'll be 27 then. and the next, 28. then 29, etc. which feel like so much more "adult" ages than the ones I've already been. my young, young adult days are over.</div><div><br /></div><div>then there's the fact that one day there will no longer be this home to go to. the days I've been living right now, will soon be no more than a distant memory. just like all the days before. it's a frightening thought because of how there's nothing I can do to stop it. the established routine has already been breaking down. days spent on my computer in the dining room or kitchen. nights in the repurposed guest room, sleeping in my bed, products and boxes splayed out in various rooms.</div><div><br /></div><div>five days remaining. no matter how much I might try to grab ahold of the present time, I'm always helpless as it slips through my fingers. even though the two weeks I have here are of the average winter vacation duration. of course it feels shorter now.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm planning on trying to simplify my life some more, letting go of things I've been pointlessly keeping track of, trying to get rid of distractions, resolving to spend less money on things still. I think the main reason I felt like I saved more money last year was because of my higher income. I go through my list and I still bought a *lot* more crap than I needed, or should have. also included in the plans are those for switching to a new note-taking app. like that's going to help.</div><div><br /></div><div>my diet and sleep have both taken large hits, as usual. I just can't eat regularly or sleep on time whenever I'm here, it seems.</div><div><br /></div><div>uncertain about continuing bjj in the future.</div><div><br /></div><div>I've sort of been talking to a Michelle on tinder, although I don't see it going anywhere (and it shouldn't). but it does feel like a breath of fresh air talking to an american girl. I don't mean anything by that; just noting a difference.</div><div><br /></div><div>tomorrow will be the last day of the year, unceremonious as usual. on this day last year, we had already left home, passing through the mall in delaware and another in virginia. I'll have to visit the delaware one again on the way down. maybe keeping Shelly in contact will have a positive impact on my mood as I journey back? as my family won't be able to accompany me this time.</div><div><br /></div><hr /><div><b>12-31 m</b></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div>I may never make the time to see DOOGIE on this trip.</div><div><br /></div><div>the average duration of these winter trips has been two weeks. starting from winter 2014, it goes: 2 weeks, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 1 week, 2 weeks.</div><div><br /></div><div>could Hannah potentially feel the same "lost connection" sort of feeling when she talks to me as I sort of feel when I talk to her, and have felt with others in the past? she's always the one who suggests Catching Up, but neither of us do anything about it afterwards.</div><div><br /></div><div>this year I've had bouts of contact with cody, dorothy, Hannah, Ben, petunia, and also texted Danny once, just before I got home. so I'm far less alone than I have been in previous years. the lines are blurring; again, one day, not only will the lines disappear, but the things they bound will no longer be around.</div><div><br /></div><div>I woke up this morning to a text from Ben detailing how only he, David Janes, and "hr lady" are at the office today. I thought maybe there'd be more people there, but it seems that nearly everyone else is also off this week, so I'm not missing anything. I was able to leave the office this year on a clean note, with no immediate outstanding tasks waiting for me that I'd be dreading on the way back. that felt good. there were a couple previous times I took off where I left something unfinished and it weighed heavily on me throughout the break.</div><div><br /></div><div>Shelly is currently in new orleans with another friend of hers whom she didn't know too well. apparently she had facetimed her before they'd really gotten to know each other, and she thought it was weird. Shelly is leaving for another trip to florida the day after I get back to atlanta. and it's unlikely that we'll meet up the night I arrive, because I'll have been driving for at least ten hours. the sad truth is that I don't like her enough to do that.</div><div><br /></div></en-note>      ]]>

<div>; 2-29 wednesday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>speak suno</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>work not to rest, work from rest. farmers = life, pirates = death if you want to destroy something, just neglect it. things may be as they are, but what they become depends on you.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>George: Stand up for what you believe in Ritchie: Be a light Tam: Be open to Jesus and recognize God at work Helen: Listen and pay attention Enoch: Stay humble because of God's grace for us Dan: Listen! Steph: Don't hold back on sharing to certain people because you don't think they deserve it Sam: Daily devotions!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and wow but I can really see how I delay myself from doing anything these days. starting this was hard. I hope it'll become more artsy and soul-filled and creative in time. that I'll learn to organize the mess in my head and plot everything down on virtual paper. I should learn to value my alone time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>aujourd'hui</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>just before ACF starts steph pulls me out into the hall with all the leaders and I pray with them. it was out of the blue and I didn't question it. if it doesn't happen next week, I'll be disappointed, and for the wrong reasons. still more social interaction overall. talking to david is easier, and he lets me drive his car. I talk with hyo jae more. she gives me her small stuffed totoro and a drawing she made of one on an index card or something. I talk with diana more too. sometimes things seem a little bit better.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I believe I'm starting to better see the 'now' in everything. including God's work. as simple as it seems, a small light bulb still lights up in my head every time I'm able to recognize something He's doing for me right Now. today in ACF we discuss sacraments and communion. I finally realize what communion is. the actual action, at least. but it's also strange that I have a much harder time keeping my mind focused today than usual because I keep thinking about steph and hyo jae.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>oh I hope I get more organized as time passes. maybe it's because I have so much to say at once that I haven't said yet that everything's rushing out at once and I can't decide what goes where.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>realize how much I can change by simply smiling. inside as well as outside. all this bitterness that came only from within me, and had no outside helper, I just hope to evaporate it all into nothing and catch it all if it rains back down to cast away again.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>just a list of things to start doing now: pray to God. read the Bible. write these 750 words. annotate a poem.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I initially didn't want to go out to eat after ACF again. aren't I glad I did? I had already written my name down on the board for &quot;dinner sign-ups&quot; so I had trapped myself. I should trapping myself more often to twist me into doing the things I sometimes don't want to do but at other times know I have to do because I actually want to.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>pray for other people. anybody.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>dive to the bottom of your heart, past the surface of that sea of _ that's so dirty but that we always end up sailing on every day because we float so easily on top of it. but if you can hold your breath for long enough you can learn to breathe under that surface and find it in you to carry out something that you've always shied away from. you find an oyster on the ocean floor but are afraid to open it in front of everyone because you don't know if it contains a pearl or not. but you create the pearl yourself, you become it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'll pray for somalia and iran and for the people there and the oppression there and for all the other countries and for strangers I meet on omegle and all the ACF leaders and the people I know who aren't ACF leaders and people I walk past praying for each other and people I see praying before taking the first bite of a meal and people I sit next to who are discussing about God and praising Jesus and for all the people on campus who live every day but never really live, who go about every day never smiling inside.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>steph gasps when helen and I mention we've never been to SunO before. steph emphasizes &quot;deprived.&quot; yes, I've been deprived of a lot. not going on a depression rant about this though. just thinking about how never experiencing this my whole life until now means I'll never see anything from their perspective. childhood. growing up. of course you can only ever view life from a single perspective, but there are many parts that are shared, mostly all the 90's fun. also all the business about being asian. I've missed out on a lot. if I care to go out on a journey and discover the new old things, even if a little bit late?</div>

; 2-1 fri
<div><br/></div><div>; 1:46 pm est</div><div><br/></div><div>1 day ago</div><div><br/></div><div>some encounters. i walked past jennifer right in front of the sixth street building, and she didn't slow her pace at all. i said a loud HI. i didn't even say hey. near CULC, i passed christina, and she asked if i was part of a small group. she's in david's again, but wasn't going that night. why did she ask me if i was in a small group? at starbucks, i tried to begin 'cloud atlas', but after 3 pages i decided it was boring and that i didn't want to read it anymore. then i read the plot summary on wikipedia. anjaly and her roommate, another jennifer, appeared. i didn't want them to see what i was reading on my laptop, and both of them slowly leaned over to see what was on my screen. that was rather annoying. it gets more annoying as i'm thinking about it now. go fuck off, will you both? anjaly seemed excited upon seeing my copy of the book. they were both waiting for a stinger because they didn't want to walk, or wait, outside &quot;in the cold.&quot; jen commented on how new my laptop and phone looked, even though they're both at least 2 years old.</div><div><br/></div><div>i don't really want to go volunteering at the place that monique posted about. even though i had responded saying essentially maybe, i ignored the rest of the posts. i'm too lazy, to work, to wake up early. i'm giving up a whole lot to stay inside and sleep. i'm giving up a day's time of opportunity to talk to her.</div><div><br/></div><div>i looked at my reflection in the window of our kitchen, while sam was sitting at the table with a bowl of pasta, and i was eating a hard-boiled egg. i looked at my reflection and felt retarded. i've never been so conscious of my fucking arms and uselessly they hang from my shoulders. i love my arms. i made sam look up late night alumni songs on youtube. i wonder if he didn't want me to be there, if he'd rather i have left, to have left him alone. he peeled an apple for me, and i got up and walked away.</div><div><br/></div><div>i skipped cs2200 today, and ethan found me when cs3510 was over. he asked where i was this morning, and i said &quot;i was hungry.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>; 20:48 pm est</div><div><br/></div><div>so my head was swimming in words as i walked back from ACF alone, and like fish in a tank, when i try to reach inside to grab them they're all gone. i remember feeling extraordinarily dead inside. every friday night used to be something i looked forward to, because it's the only day of any week that i get any human interaction at all. now it frightens me. i would have stayed outside during their worship, but david was sitting there with steph. i definitely did not want to be out there with the two of them, alone. so i had to walk in the room and listen to their boring songs. christina and vince sang. christina was in my group. she was wearing a white sweatshirt i could see her bra cup outline through. i didn't bother marking up my copy of the passage at all. i couldn't talk, i couldn't smile. i felt so heavy, and sick of seeing all of their faces and hearing their voices. i'm just so TIRED of them all. and i thought my sophomore year was bad. my tolerance is..low.</div><div><br/></div><div>i used to try to find people to text in the middle of ACF, so i would feel like i had someone who wanted to talk to me. early on, i'd text melissa. she would never answer on time. today i had to do that again, but i knew i would never achieve the desired feeling, so i just texted anjaly to tell her she could have 'cloud atlas' if she wanted. then she stopped answering. and i didn't care.</div><div><br/></div><div>when it was finally all over, i followed monique around, waited until she said hi to me, and asked her two things, one being whether she would go to chicago, and the other for my steam password. she wasn't sure about chicago and she wouldn't give me my password, for at least another two weeks she said. i can change my password myself any time i want, but i'll ask her again in two weeks. then i wanted to ask her to tell me when the group gets back to campus from dinner, and she said okay eventually, but at first she kept on shuffling away from me whenever i started to talk, walking away and looking back at me. so i asked david to tell me when the group gets back to campus from dinner. i thought about asking mike, but he isn't one of the only 4 people i've texted since school started, and i didn't want him to be the fifth.</div><div><br/></div><div>as of now, though, i'm not so sure i'll be joining them afterwards anyway. i know no one will miss me. i wish i wouldn't care about them as much as i do. i wish they would mean nothing to me.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 2-4 fri</div><div><br/></div><div>; 1:49 pm est</div><div><br/></div><div>about a year and 4 months ago, i went to six flags with monique, ritchie, and allison. how well did i know them back then? monique i had known for about a year, and ritchie and allison for only a month then. i don't really feel like i know any of them any better now. with someone like allison..she isn't even a friend NOW. it's fruitless to think about how the activity had done nothing to bring us together, even though i had hugged her when we got back to campus. a ghost of christmas past, a spark that never caught. we're alienated, and i feel even further apart than i actually am because i like too much to concentrate on how close i once was, and how much close i could have gotten had i not switched the magnet off. ~</div><div><br/></div><div>i know it's because of this summer, for since that sun set i've been constantly wavering between a dark and light state, manic and depressive, optimistic and hopeless, god and godless, giving up and staying resolute. i just can't decide which to pick. i settle on one, get tired, and try out the other again. neither stays, neither satisfies. i feel like my self has dissolved. CAN SOMEONE HELP ME STAY ON A BETTER PATH. i keep talking about momentum and that i'm always running out of it. someone push me! but i shouldn't need anyone to push me. that would make me a child, which i am, sitting on a swing, needing a grown-up to get moving.</div><div><br/></div><div>anyway the point is that for a long while i just haven't stopped switching between being isolated, aloof, cut off and trying to reintegrate myself into my only circle of friends. i tried quite hard to stay among them last year, and this time around i spent a lot of time convincing myself that such effort is worthless, only to reverse myself soon after and then re-reverse again after that. circles go nowhere.</div><div><br/></div><div>lately i have thought a lot about Zoro the witch hunter and i hope she hasn't forgotten me or L4D2, and that she hasn't made too many new friends, or stopped playing the game, or will be otherwise uninterested in picking up the gameplay where i had left it. never thought i would think these things when i first played online.</div><div><br/></div><div>i felt more relaxed at not having to talk to ethan or anybody in cs2200, because for now that won't matter anymore. and perhaps not letting him know i dropped the class isn't worth wasting 3 hours a week.</div><div><br/></div><div>leah waved at me.</div><div><br/></div><div>; 7:14 pm est</div><div><br/></div><div>too late.</div><div><br/></div><div>i still can't wipe my silly grin that stubbornly pastes itself onto my face every time i see hayson. he surprised me by inviting me to a bible study. i immediately thought no, and he assured me that his feelings wouldn't be hurt because my averting the question was so bloody obvious. i asked things like who else would be coming and how old they were. he named two other people who might have gone. otherwise it was just him alone. and as i walked off towards me room i realized i simply should have said yes, because if i go then at least that's one day, today, where i get to do something at all different. hayson said 5:30, and it wasn't time yet so i sat at the CULC stairs and saw him walk past, on the first floor. i thought he might be taking the elevator up to the third floor, because of that one time we walked to skiles together when he didn't want to take stairs, so i waited outside the 3rd floor side entrance but he never came out of there. then i wandered to the d.m. smith building, breathing and looking up at the sky, and eventually roamed the halls of the d.m. smith building alone, but didn't find hayson anywhere. maybe i was early. maybe he was behind one of the closed classroom doors that i was afraid to open, maybe he ended up not going himself..but i missed it today. sad.</div><div><br/></div><div>&quot;adam.&quot; she called out his name as she approached him on the skiles stairs. he turned around, his arms hanging, his face passive, as always. his lips, though, eventually spread into a smooth smile. &quot;heyyy.&quot; he dragged it out. and they hugged. they buried the bottom halves of their faces into each other's shoulders. &quot;what're you doing?&quot; &quot;oh..just been walking. breathing, looking at the sky.&quot; a giggle. &quot;campus looks nice.&quot; &quot;wish the grass wasn't so yellow.&quot; &quot;the grass?&quot; they were still holding on to each other and rotated 180 degrees so the other could see the grass. &quot;oh.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 2-7 thurs</div><div><br/></div><div>; 5:11 pm est</div><div><br/></div><div>sometimes i feel ready. i think about ACF oftentimes as i feel it, picturing specific people and smiling at them (there i go with that word again). starting a conversation? maintaining a conversation? being happy? there i go with that word again. i make the resolution to myself that i can never keep because i never get the chance to execute my plan. by the time next week rolls around, the will has dissolved. but being miserable, not necessarily depressed, is so pathetic. i can see that.</div><div><br/></div><div>at other times, when i think about specific people (by &quot;specific&quot; i mean focusing on a concrete person or persons, not certain people that i happen to think about more for any reason), the past two to three years of my life melt in my head. that time is all i now know. my reality orbits it, and solely it, yet at the same it feels incomprehensibly fuzzy and seems to have never happened. my magicant doesn't exist in the past two to three years. all time before that is fantasy.</div><div><br/></div><div>last night, that happened when i thought about monique while laying in bed trying to fall asleep.</div><div><br/></div><div>now i'm back on the CULC 3rd floor. it feels just a little bit good to be, i suppose, among people, though i'm not any less lonely, to be sure. seeing people around me doing their homework comforts me a little bit. especially those who are sitting alone, like me. silent, not talking to anyone. so i won't be the only one, for just a while.</div><div><br/></div><div>and i'm back to feeling exhausted.</div><div><br/></div><div>jessie roth has found a job (most likely). so has jordan carmignani. i've been following them around, and felt okay because they seemed as lost as i was. they've found ways now. well. one of them. the one called jessie may soon work at a bakery/coffee shop PLACE THING surrounded by food. she already knows how to cut fruit. the one called jordan has found a life, without school, without a college degree, with a boy, and in germany. is what she has really all you need? it makes me wonder, no, question what i'm doing here, spending so much time in this dreary setting because that's what everyone else does, or so i thought. i thought this was indeed required. but that's..wrong. wrong, wrong.</div><div><br/></div><div>what if it never becomes worth it? what if i can't make up my deficits? then all of this time will have spent in vain, for nothing. how can i make sure i do this right?</div><div><br/></div><div>come to think of it, i wonder if the two interviews i have pending are things i should be excited about. i'm as uncomfortable as ever thinking about it, not treating it as monumentally as i feel like i should be. i don't really want to do it.</div><div><br/></div><div>the girl sitting at the other end of the table closes her laptop lid and her workspace disappears into her bag. i always become slightly sad when dissociated friendships leave. she's taking a piece of me [i]with[/i] her.</div><div><br/></div><div>another stray thought i had today is that sam has become the new tom. almost. i'm not as close to him as i once was with tom. i don't want to be.</div><div><br/></div><div>remember that time you logged into your facebook at the apple store and started messaging friends telling them you just got arrested? &quot;they're giving me access to facebook to contact my parents.&quot; lol!</div><div><br/></div><div>if i met someone at a bar and managed to strike up a conversation, here's what i'd want to do (if hypothetical situation permits). i would tell him/her about the girl i had a huge crush on in sixth grade and later fell in love with after she moved over 7000 miles away. and how silly and angry with myself i had felt afterwards, when our contact began to break, disrupting my delusions as it did.</div><div><br/></div><div>i'm not sure why. one person just went &quot;really?&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>i don't love a whole lot about my high school years, but i wish my current closest friend didn't despise his also. we have little to reminisce about.</div><div><br/></div><div>nostalgic amnesia sets in. fantasy takes over the rest. fantasy is making me increasingly anxious. how is something that i know does not exist able to trouble my mind so? i'm in a cage, here. my cage, my little cage.</div><div><br/></div><div>a bad reading of the situation. the right reading is that i just don't understand it. at all.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 2-15 fri</div><div><br/></div><div>; 6:46 pm est</div><div><br/></div><div>is this it? is the time on friday nights going to become meaningless too? i'm not going to ACF. to be honest, i would say if anyone bothered to ask, i just didn't feel like going. i don't feel, i wouldn't say to anyone who'd bother to ask, like i belong there anymore. if this is the end, it's going to become the death of me, i think. maybe, after i've starved myself enough, i'll have nowhere to crawl to but their doorsteps again, where i'll scramble to take in every ounce of welcome i end up getting.</div><div><br/></div><div>my mind has largely been in stasis for the last week thanks to dead space 3. i had wanted to try to write about the sun setting again. it would have been about monique, and how the day that she prayed an impromptu prayer for me ended up making no difference. i wonder if she even remembers it, or what she said. i changed my steam password for myself, without telling her about it. wonder when she'll ask, or realize. i guess Zoro the witch hunter doesn't care about me either. i don't know why i smiled so much while playing L4D2 for the first time in almost 4 weeks last night.</div><div><br/></div><div>a few days ago, someone called out my name for the first time in days, maybe over a week. and i looked and saw that it was christine, with her boyfriend, i'm pretty sure, and others, who offered me a free donut and said i could donate to whatever if i wanted. i took a little donut and held it there for a few seconds while everyone there started talking to someone else she was closer friends with, before saying thanks in too soft a voice. she thanked me for a donation i didn't give.</div><div><br/></div><div>while listening to regina spektor and thinking about how i'm never as alone as i make myself out to be, i began to wonder if i subconsciously like this self-made depression i wallow in, because the music made me pseudo-happy. i felt a kind of thin-veiled content that was completely offset by my knowing that one, it was not complete, serene content, and two, it would not last. this must be what heroin feels like. but i only get sad when i think about the bad? i can't live like this forever.</div><div><br/></div><div>i never ask anjaly to &quot;play&quot; anymore. i guess a Friendship between us was never meant to be, but i can still salvage it if i want to. she can keep the fucking book. it could be a saving grace though, maybe that will be the only reason she will ever contact me again.</div><div><br/></div><div>if i ever am inspired to return to (trying out) faith, it will be because of c.s. lewis. i need to read up more about the guy.</div><div><br/></div><div>as a &quot;test&quot; i pretended to not see yan 3 times in one day. actually the first time she seemed to be really taken aback and waved. i didn't even bother to lift an arm. she wore an orange sweatshirt. after that, she never tried to get my attention, nor i hers, so there's nothing left to complain about.</div><div><br/></div><div>thinking about her led me to thinking about christina, and any of the other ACF freshman with whom my &quot;critical period&quot; has passed. there's a critical period for friendship development just as there is in language development (but the friendship critical period is significantly shorter, of course). once it's gone there's no getting it back. there's no chance of becoming friends now, because other people have always taken up all the slots. flawed way of thinking?</div><div><br/></div><div>i used to look down upon helen, and the fact that i'm happy to see her because she'll respond to seeing me says something about how low i've sunk with respect to where i've been. i was eating and decided to move a table i saw her eating alone at. i had to repeat myself multiple times because i was too quiet. again with my voice being one of those scratchy, underused guy's ones. she asked if i would be going to ACF, which indicates to me that i'm not the only one who feels that i'm not a part of ACF anymore.</div><div><br/></div><div>the three letters make me sick.</div><div><br/></div><div>i feel like a retard, literally a retard, whenever sam is in the kitchen when i'm boiling pasta. worthless conversation, and i stand there, in my white aeropostale shirt, my skinny arms hanging from my shoulders in its sleeves, my voice soft as fuck. him probably feeling like he has to stay so he won't leave me.</div><div><br/></div><div>in the past week i've gone 24 hours without eating, twice.</div><div><br/></div><div>maybe if i get myself to stretch, meditate, and exercise, i'll feel a little better.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 2-18 mon</div><div><br/></div><div>i've completely lost it. where do i begin? i'm withdrawing, retreating into my shell and curling up there in the dark more tightly than i ever have. i'm tearing my social life to shreds. by disconnecting myself in every manner possible, ensuring my self-imposed isolation. allegory of the cave the cave is my dorm room. v told me that i should still go to ACF. i shouldn't take all of his advice seriously, but because it's the only advice i get, i dissect every word he says. last night i didn't sleep at all because i simply didn't feel like and as a result felt massively disoriented this morning. i kept falling asleep while taking notes in class. i'm sure people were laughing at me. when i look forward to playing L4D2 in the same virtual worlds over and over with Zoro the witch hunter more than i &quot;look forward&quot; to ACF and such now..that's how i know i have a big problem. i want to hold on to the blessed ignorance that fills my head when i plug up my ears with my headphones and let some sappy music flood in. last night i was so desperate for human contact that i didn't even think twice about messaging asta. i'm afraid we're gone. i can barely remember what it was like to love her. on saturday morning, tam and jennifer were holding hands, walking. i found the sight unreal..and shocking. i felt a slight stirring within me, a less severe tug at my heartstrings, but the same kind i used to get when i would look at steph, back when i thought i could love her too. i knew right then just why i am so alone. jennifer didn't say anything and tam asked me where i've been. i spoke in an absurdly quiet voice, unable to hide how surprised i was at this evidence of progress. and then shortly after they walked away, helen came sauntering down, to wait for the grocery shuttle like i was, and to my horror and a bit of disgust, i felt..a sensation of relief because, even though it was helen of all people, here was someone i Recognized. and after being out of the sun for what felt like weeks, that fact alone was so welcoming. our conversation on the bus was anything but normal, and i made no attempt to turn things around. in my mind it was all over already.</div><div><br/></div><div>can't imagine what's up with me, but i want to take a short video of dead space 3 gameplay on my computer showing me using the &quot;devil horns&quot; foam finger weapon and show it to steph. a shout out to a less-than-couple-minutes-long moment a year ago or so. knowing me, i'll probably do it anyway.</div><div><br/></div><div>and holy shit it's been nearly a year since barcelona, and all the mixed feelings that plagued me before those summer months. and look at where my ass is now. unbelievable. i just don't give a shit about anything. &quot;far&quot; by regina spektor still evokes amazing strong nostalgia about the most amazing times of my life, that have not carried over to this side of the atlantic. i've decided that it's now one of my most prized emotions.</div><div><br/></div><div>well monique just gave me my steam password back, except not really because i had changed it 4 days ago unbeknownst to her. she asked if it had &quot; at least done any good,&quot; and it honestly hasn't. i've gotten worse. we've gone backwards.</div><div><br/></div><div>in my delirious, near-drunken state i decided to send a nonplussed &quot;hey&quot; to mo, with whom i'm having a skeletal exchange of words. hmm. doesn't matter. so far regina spektor and arcade and a little bit of fun. are working wonders.</div><div><br/></div><div>would someone please ask me, &quot;are you okay, bunny?&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>asta told me to talk to her moreeee. something like that, she always says whenever we haven't talked in a long while. last night was the first time we communicated in over 3 months. i don't have the nerve to try messaging tom. i do kind of want to tell v that i sincerely value his friendship most of all. even though we have always fairly sucked, in my opinion, at being serious around each other. maybe i should just stop being silly every time i talk to him. he has a far larger social network than i do (mine is virtually nonexistent) so i may not be as much of a bane to him as i could be to the people here..and myself.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 2-19 tues</div><div><br/></div><div>i decided to continue my text conversation with monique and she suddenly mentioned the movie 'beginners' while we were talking about video games yet again and she suggested that we watch it. um? she said she won't be busy next wednesday, and i'm not sure if this will somehow turn into a movie night event among ACF people, and if it does we might end up doing something entirely different anyway..a simple one-on-one movie watching has happened nearly never with me and something as small that seems too good to be true. we'll see what happens. this time she has stopped replying.</div><div><br/></div><div>i have been thinking increasingly often about Zoro the witch hunter, wondering what she's like in real life, now that chatting while in-game online is something that i actually look forward to after classes. i wonder who her real life friends are. she keeps talking about joining the army. an army girl, i keep thinking. she told me that she has a crush on a fellow player, TheHylianGuard, who lives in england somewhere, and that they've been video chatting. i don't even think that's weird. perhaps this is a good thing: that i don't really feel like playing l4d2 without her. since others rarely chat in-game, and i feel by now like i know Zoro, albeit to a very limited extent.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 2-20 wed</div><div><br/></div><div>; 9:00 pm est</div><div><br/></div><div>the total number of people who i recognize that i've bumped into in the past two days must be around 7. some were surprising, like anna, who smiled and waved at me, because every other time i've encountered her she never made any acknowledgment. i saw sam eller today, and i was again aware of how quietly i spoke. as i was looking at him i thought about how my mental cache of his characteristics and mannerisms somehow seemed to alter his physical appearance and the overall way i saw him..happens with everyone i guess.</div><div><br/></div><div>i'm losing the few shreds of inspiration and motivation i have left. i've given up, again. the sad thing is that i've felt this way several times before. there's so much more to do..and i'm being incredibly ungrateful and stupid to be keeping myself inside.</div><div><br/></div><div>i can't let Zoro become dangerously more than a mere online presence. her odd affair with TheHylianGuard isn't my business, and i'm okay with not caring about it. i won't let it.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 2-25 mon</div><div><br/></div><div>what a glorious weekend. that's right, sleeping in later than usual and doing nothing but play video games for an uninterrupted two days is now a highlight of the week.</div><div><br/></div><div>so Zoro isn't dangerous, as long as my big picture doesn't include her. i keep thinking about how she's joining the military. how different her family must be from the families of everybody around me i know. she's often cited her own blonde hair as a reminder that she's not particularly smart. yet sometimes when i think about her it makes everything i do here seem utterly useless. lately she's messaged me on steam several times asking me to play L4D2 with her, &quot;for a little while?&quot; cute.</div><div><br/></div><div>i saw my phone's screen light up for instant, and it turned out to be a facetime call from tom. whether it was an accident or not i don't know. it was from his ipod touch, which he's had for a couple of years by now, so that rules out the possibility that he just got a new iphone and wanted to test out facetime with me, or anything like that. instead of facetime calling him back, i texted him. we got nowhere.</div><div><br/></div><div>hey remember that time when you developed some sort of crush with a girl who lived in canada? who called you by pet names online when you'd be chatting on AIM? i don't remember what her name is. and we had, for a brief moment, wanted to drive to canada together to pay her a visit.</div><div><br/></div><div>even though i'm all but incapable of having fun traveling alone, i'm still about to settle on a week-long trip to london and one other yet-to-be-determined place (barcelona?). for i'd much rather dick around with v than prepare for &quot;evangelizing&quot; and &quot;outreach&quot; in chicago.</div><div><br/></div><div>rereading any of my notes i had posted last summer will be saddening. one reason i can't do it is because i had already read them so many times whilst proofreading them, and another will be how sad i will get while reading the comments and remembering how foolish i was to think that those bonds would last.</div><div><br/></div><div>having something to look forward to is a rare amenity for me now. the only i have going for me this week is watching 'beginners' with monique on wednesday. i'm prepared, as always, for it to evaporate and never happen.</div><div><br/></div><div>; 1:05 am est</div><div><br/></div><div>asta's facebook is deactivated.</div></en-note>      ]]>

<div><br/></div>
<div>currently out of my senses. the events dating back until friday, the 31st of january are as follows:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last friday night, i ordered another chicken alfredo at jason's deli. ACF friday attendance has been dipping lately (this has been mentioned in the small groups as well) so there weren't very many people there. it would have been entirely refreshing, were it not for me still trying too hard to be someone else. that's it, that's the mystical. i felt very artificial again as i was talking to everybody. it should have been better, since there were fewer people, but it wasn't. even ritchie fared better than i did. i couldn't come up with anything to say. that's always a problem.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>before all that happened i skipped the first of ACF in favor of L4D2. steph caught me arriving. i still think clement kind of sucks as a speaker, i like listening to enoch much more. clement is simply not inspirational and very flat. he makes me bored, plain and simple.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i shared nothing while we were discussing whatever about the book of jonah. i noticed jonathan (whose last name i now know) didn't share anything either, and i didn't like that.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i glimpsed monique's car in the parking lot. she looked weird sitting in the driver's seat of the big suv.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the discussion at dinner saw peak interest in the topic of DATING, oh and steph mentioned that her parents questioned sam's sexuality at some point. vince said that his parents don't ask him about dating and probably think he's &quot;hopeless.&quot; there are parts of me that want/don't want to agree with that.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on saturday, i worked a closing shift at the competition pool. the meet ran later than usual and it was still extremely busy when i got there. the guard who was friendly to me was there and i learned that his name is dan too. he did that weird nipple pinch thing, kept doing it. i feel like his pet mouse.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>there was also a new guard there that asked me a lot of questions, standard run-of-the-mill stupid questions, and i didn't want to answer them, nor talk to him. i thought you are supposed to become good friends with your co-workers? why do i want nothing to do with them? some of them; the situation FEELS perpetually out of control. when i'm not interested, though, i'm not interested. i'm just dying to use my vocal chords, but not on you. i just didn't want to talk.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i took a packet home with me, containing information about the meet and who was in which heat and whatnot. for a limited time only, this will hold a decrepit sentimental value.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on sunday, i went to lunch with jimmy's parents (and jimmy himself, finally) after aborting a last-second attempt to bail. there were 3 other people there who i don't know, and who were non-native english speakers. who the fuck? i said very little at the table and seeing jimmy was not so different from not seeing him. i said almost nothing to him. i guess that's too bad. one of them drove me home, and the car was nearly silent the whole way, subtracting &quot;billboard&quot; music. he asked me if i play any games. you must be pretty desperate if you ask someone if they play any games.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on monday, yesterday, there was small group, and the noteworthy things about that were: george was there, the big guy, out of the blue; jonathan said something about believing in demons and that they do in fact attack humans on this earth by means of demonic possession, which led to a mini-discussion about it. why do you think monique never picks me to pray? laurie left early, it's like she isn't even part of the group. i guess allison is gone too, and there was a new girl from singapore whose accent i didn't like hearing. don't let that be a permanent bar, though. keep in mind.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>after the meeting officially ended monique expressed her concern that although she has been leading for some time, she still feels that she can't get it right, can't keep a smooth discussion going about things. i told her i prefer her group to louisa's whose group i went to last week. she straight up asked &quot;are you lying?&quot; to which i answered with a truthful no.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and before THAT happened, ryan fucking chu was at the pool during my 1-freaking-hour shift. he can't swim. go figure.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm dead certain that that was ritika (a.k.a. Thing 2) sitting in CULC as i walked past.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>up next: mindy (brief), how a workout makes you feel (emotionally), the homeless person, the trip to b&amp;n, lisa.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
feb 6 r</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<div>day 37</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so mindy and i passed each other on the street. she flashed a fast but broad smile at me, and i was pleasantly surprised. we're nothing, remember.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i am still unable to pinpoint why, but i really enjoy guarding at the pool. except, of course, during the weekly workout hour, in which i am reminded that all the rest of them exist and are hiding outside of immediate scope. i always find myself taking a guilty sort of comfort in seeing the other loners. the ones who also don't seem to quite fit, mesh, blend, who also look uncomfortable in the large presence and who would rather be home at the moment. they're rarely the cutest ones, but you just can't see that far into them in such a state. that's the reason we don't bond, after all.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so why do i like the pool? is it the &quot;family&quot;, the camaraderie, some bond we all share? because i can feel it, but i don't see it, and i don't think it's really there. this is the work of an unstable mind, one that creates its own comfort. in the following years, this may be all that i can remember the time and place by.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i went to the tech barnes &amp; noble two days ago and bought a tech hoodie, just as i promised myself. i went after a simple one, a light yellow with the words GEORGIA TECH and nothing else. the one i always picture allison wearing. i also bought a fiction book that i picked off a shelf purely at random. i have yet to begin reading it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>one the way there i noticed a homeless man (presumably) sitting on the benches at tech square but opted to stay on course, and sure enough he came up to me and asked me if i had any change. well i didn't empty my wallet for him, but have him $2 out of a requested $2.50 and he said god bless me. i felt extremely uncomfortable, as though afraid that i was doing a wrong thing. but how could it be? dan fitz's rule of no money food only is to be disregarded utterly (it's also heavily outdated and applies to no situation). after leaving barnes and noble, he asked again for the remaining $0,50, but i told him i had no change. he must have seen the bag i was carrying, full of the two items i had just purchased. but i had used a slab of plastic, not cash. i felt no urge to cry whatsoever, nor did i feel any good inside.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>that girl's name is tess. during the workout, we partnered up for practicing rescues, and i could feel parts of my mind shut down. not out of any sort of fear, but because she is such a normal person. so is cheyenne. i executed two of the rescues slightly incorrectly, but both times neither she nor tess corrected me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>en route home from the workout, i encountered lisa outside the ULC door and we had another conversation-ling while walking up the stairs. she introduced me to some friend of hers named sam who i don't remember if i've met before, in an exact replica of the situation. she asked me what i was doing at the CULC at 1 am, referring to a photo i had posted onto facebook, therefore either accidentally or uncaringly revealing that she saw the damn thing. i don't want her to be genuinely interested at all. before parting, she pointed out my water bottle, of all things, saying &quot;i have a camelback too!&quot; and i replied with an equally stupid comment, &quot;i remember you talking about it.&quot; my inspiration was, after all, her own water bottle. do you think she remembers the discussion we had about it?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lately i have been reflecting on recent life events and i've noticed that many of them lead to a common thought: &quot;i wish i had done this sooner.&quot; how do i avoid experiencing this emotion continuously?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>david made several blasted confusing simple comments on a facebook status of mine, saying hi and asking me how are you. is this some sort of attempt?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i picked up 2 of katie d.'s shifts today, totaling 2.5 hours, mainly because i had dreamt about her the night before. i'd like to think that i did something nice. maybe she used the extra time to sleep a little and dream about me. one never knows.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today, i also bailed on monique for no good reason, and after a reading a tumblr of post of hers specifically detailing the event i chose to skip, i feel very guilty. i don't want to take it personally, but i'm perpetually paranoid of things like this actually being a direct attack. there is of course no way to confirm this, which doesn't help. she described...&quot;people willing to sacrifice some time to be with [her].&quot; there is no hope here, now. just the usual hopelessness instead, coupled with the conscious decisions to increase it further. who would ever sacrifice time to be with me? why would anyone want to do such a thing anyway (for me, i mean)?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i am not looking forward to emerge. we're really going in blind now. we're really damning the torpedoes now.</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>

feb 8 s</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>handwritten:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we got here yesterday. everything is mixed up. i haven’t been here in a LONG time. felt some emotions i forgot i could feel, and then some. some parts were easy, some were hard. a difference between this instance and the last few: i know how to fix the problems now, but was still too afraid to try.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we will be mentioned monique as little as possible. my responses towards her would seem to suggest a crush, where this time one does not exist. i think i had a small, quiet anxiety attack on the way here. i could feel my inability to converse properly.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>there are several unfamiliarly familiar faces here, some of (well perhaps all of) whom surprised me by recognizing my own. i wasn’t sure what to make of it. however it’s clear where i got my energy from, however minute it was.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>getting here before the masses rocked. i didn’t meet many new people until the end of the night, and the statuses on they may be forever pending. i tried to think of, and couldn’t really succeed, a main reason as to why i don’t like the ideas they uphold. maybe i’m still denying them, who knows.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>how long will the gravity remain this time?</div>

<div>now, what has changed between this time and the last, well, we’ve moved on from one kind of pain to another. the quiet time that i looked semi-forward to didn’t last long, and it was in the morning. at breakfast, and subsequently lunch, i sat with only techies. that itself isn’t a regression, but it wasn’t fulfilling. during the time in between: first, we sang more worship music. one was a filipino song, and clement and crystal hopped on stage in the middle of it and started a dance that we sort of followed. (i tried. the people to my left didn’t.) the scripture discussed was more from exodus about moses, and i kept falling asleep. i had to go to the bathroom to splash water on my face, twice. a girl named christine, who i met yesterday, also kept nodding of, and i thought it was funny. the small group activity was to make some sort of timeline marking important life events. i made one inspired by one i had seen made by jessie r., plotting overall self-content against time/year. however i didn’t feel like explaining my emotions and their sources as depicted on my graph, and explicitly said so to my group. i’m not sure if i made a mistake there.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we are currently in free time and i am sitting at a picnic table, alone. one thing i don’t believe i will have the fortune to experience this time is the forging of the unique bonds that can only be made in this setting, in these woods, with God nearby. i don’t feel compelled. (are you sure? maybe it’s still happening.) tony is the one who raised this awareness, and it is my perception of him that i will monitor before drawing a conclusion.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it’s becoming harder to keep my mouth shut, but no easier getting it to open.</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>hey i got back to school this afternoon. from where? my retreat. oh right!!! so sorry been out of it. how was it? mixed emotions. there was content, and there was a lot of sadness too. (i don't want to talk about being sad anymore) why sadness? mainly because, i'm graduating soon and i don't know how many of these people i'll ever see again. i'm not sure who'd want to see me either. so you're worried about your social life. i also realized just how much i had thrown away last year in terms of relationships and - are you insecure? yeah...quite worried. i'm very insecure. can i suggest this? trust in Him. He'll provide you the right people in your life. you just came from a retreat. most people have retreat highs. i say this because i completely detached from my friends. i keep in touch with two people from all of university. one from high school. i was beyond insecure too. i'll be lucky to keep as much. i can't get over what i've done to myself. lemme find a podcast of the sermon that broke me. o.k. i think i heard God more clearly than i usually do. that's good! what did you hear? He just wants me to come back to Him. for you see among the relationships i burned to the ground was the one i had with...Jesus. i'm seriously considering it. i think you should. He's waiting for you. if you trust in Him that means you're giving up your worries. in a sense, it's basically just becoming optimistic and dependent. two very difficult achievements. no one said it was effortless, you learn to not care as much about what everyone thinks. that's not important. i'm so worried about my relationships here. it's normal but i'm saying to learn to not. oh. oh my. how? just pray and see if you'll go back to Him. okay, i'll try.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the above summarizes my weekend experience. after glimpsing everybody else's vast underwater networks, i'm ready to just give up completely. there are no more new entries, there is no time left to dig tunnels in the snow. the bond i share with monique that i so recently considered gold is now known to be put a plank floating in the water amongst icebergs. the new character wendy will make no future appearances in my story.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so, no new connections were made this time. not with clement, not with anybody who thus far had still been considered new. we went as we were and left as nothing more to each other. dan h., crystal, and young k. all made cameos. i HAD forgotten that they existed.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i may have, at last, found a potential reason as to why exactly divine intervention has been continually denied. it surfaced, of course, as no more than an epiphany, resulting from a state of mind i haven't entered in years. it's currently being studied under close scrutiny.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night some gate was torn down and i was able to see allison in a new light. i've always thought of her as a fake person who exaggerates her words, but i somehow really liked her while we were playing our games. the bad news is that it took me 2.5 years to come to this. monique recognized me in my new hoodie. i think jonathan p. and i could be good friends, but i've put zero effort thus far towards making that happen.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today's tutoring was unremarkable and because of that i had no room to think about accompanying monique at tech rec anyway. kwiley was sitting at a nearby table and i talked to him for the first time in almost 2 months? i need to be truer when conversing with people. it SHOULD NOT be this difficult, but this is a problem and we must deal with it, because we ARE afflicted with it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>apparently i missed another ACF population hangout that occurred tonight in my own building. things like this make me want to seal the deal and call it an era lost. it COULD have been so much more, if i hadn't been so especially childish. the rest of them, they have it good. monique for instance is on the leadership team, rooms with them, lives here, has her own car, and can do basically anything. from now on, she needs to be mentioned as little as possible.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>quality time. remember the renaissance? do you think you could initiate another one?</div>

feb 18 t</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<div>i take full advantage of the pool's massive amount of background ambience to sing while on stand, where no one can hear me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i've become quite used to being ignored. attention has long since lost its necessity, but it's still mildly disappointing when none of the swim coaches even glance at me when i'm rotating to and from the stands. i think they could at least give me that tiny nod that people do. i guess lifeguards have always been background characters anyway. i like not existing when i don't need to.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>bucketing the pool deck is the best part of cleanup despite how tiring it is and how sore my back gets, because the watching all the hair, spilled drinks, food crumbs, and other grime get washed away into the drains feels so good (if you don't or don't think you will feel the same way, that's okay). this results in a shiny and much cleaner floor that i'm not afraid to walk on barefoot anymore. maybe i should do the same thing...WITH MY SINS.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>cleanup also rocks because it is performed after the crowd disappears, and while i actually enjoy being in the crowd (anomaly) i like the emptiness more. i tried explaining this to rachel collins, but couldn't make it past the first step. i wonder what she and buzzell are always talking about, and if she likes him. as a person. not sure if it was the light, or the heat, but i'm pretty sure i saw her blush when he said, &quot;i saw these [he held up a couple chewy bars] and thought of you.&quot; her skin was glowing. this game has so many rules. she's probably simply a nice person...she always smiles when i, another guard, another person, comes near. i was afraid to even look at her. i established no verbal communication channel, and the ship set sail.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i was happy when nica appeared to greet specifically me with a smile and a wave (i'm so stupid) when the LP guards filed into the office after the LP closed. i offered her a banana muffin from the little bites bag i was holding and, she said sure when i told her they were banana muffins, but dropped the one that she took. i had to offer her another one, but she couldn't take another one.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lori has quite advanced points of view on the central figure of christianity. i briefly shared my thoughts on it all again, namely that i am still stuck on &quot;step zero&quot; and have been able to advance any further since joining the team. maybe it's because i had just swum before heading to monique's apartment, but i was unusually cheery during small group, not talkative but not as silent as i usually am, and i didn't space out at all (almost). i rejected the opportunity to provide a closing prayer, provided to me courtesy of monique, but said in my head what i would have said out loud if i hadn't backed away. interesting, but in retrospect not surprisingly, lori refused too.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>after everybody rushed out, i was the one to stay behind again for a little bit, and talked with monique who promised to uphold our sublime donuts deal. i'm hoping it will just be me and she, but that sort of thing is just about always too good to be true. prepare conversation topics now.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>somehow, nearly the entirety of the latest switchfoot album 'fading west' invokes phantom recall, of...ACF. of course. the elements certainly help...maybe they're all that is needed.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we're glad that zora is still hanging on. i find her recommended flight paths to be strongly questionable, as they are often direct and straightforward to an alarming degree. how could such a straight approach possibly work, i wonder. remember, though, and every person is different. for all you know, a head-on collision may be the only foolproof, surefire method.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>optimism must be manufactured, like a drug. only select tunnels are capable of outputting this emotion, just as others are confirmed to always result in raining despair. we know how to fix the problems now, and of course the answer was always there, simple as it is, blind as we were. of course this is still step zero, the biggest step. so we actually still haven't gotten anywhere yet. how's that for progress? look at the other people. not what we were expecting at all, right?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the last thing vince said at small group yesterday was that he and monique will always be here for us, if we ever need somebody to talk to. why do you suppose we were thought to need such a reminder?</div>
<div><br/></div>

<div>
<div>my thoughts toward katie delgado are downright silly. first, i think of lorde when i see her, because they both have curly hair. and acne (a little). second, that ONE HALF moment a month ago or so when we were changing the pandora station in the guard office, to a 90's music station...which may not have even happened. is what spurred the short-lived 90's spike consisting only of a pinch of britney spears.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the make-up workout today was sparsely populated. i passed tom just before i reached the office and actually choked, upon seeing HIM...all i said was &quot;hi&quot; as he walked past, probably for the last time since, as was announced, today was his last day working here. i guess i'm one person he won't remember. for a short while it seemed as though yusuf and i would be the only ones at the workout, but three other people thankfully made it in. i wouldn't have minded if it had ended up being just us two, but i could feel the social anxiety getting its grip on. we did all the same stuff as yesterday. i took two cinnamon rolls. my locker combination is 9-27-13.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i now consciously assign songs to memories, of time and place. tonight i walked around campus for over an hour, to clough to the student center to skiles to klaus to MSE past howey down atlantic past clough again and along ferst past the CRC to sixth back home. all the while infusing the three albums i've picked out with the sights and sounds of this phase of my life. the three albums are 'pure heroine', 'the listening', and 'fading west'. 'reflektor' and 'citrus' are halted in-process indefinitely. i wish i hadn't wasted a whole year, i thought to myself wistfully, as i walked. whenever i hear certain songs i will break down internally.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so lately, i've been dumping a lot of my random load on ritchie via text, and i have to imagine what he's perceiving it as. nothing more than a blip on the radar, sure. i have strong evidence that my absence on facebook is largely unnoticed. nobody understands my ramblings anyway. and they shouldn't! perhaps this will provide stronger cause to nuke the damn thing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday is the day lisa stopped me in the stairs, to make her signature small talk, small talk that i want to hear for once. realize that she continued a topic that began months ago (her discrete math class). i wonder if she's broken up with her boyfriend. she's still looking for a job too, apparently? this is her last semester here too. i don't want to get too into her. maybe she's an archetype i haven't encountered yet, that i have to learn about. 'acquaintance' perhaps? just like what kelly was to me when i first met her. i thought everything about people was real, before learning of all the onion-like layers.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i want to avoid talking about God, but for all i know at this point, this is just his way of making himself known to me. what bothers me about it all is the question, that i have to choose whether or not to believe in him. there is no foreseeable way that i can believe, and there is now also no way for me to disbelieve. so which is it? one, or the other. the answer to this one can only be undeclared for a limited, unspecified amount of time. and this followup still exists and presses: what is it about the image that you do not like? that you outright refuse to accept? does it pertain to the image itself or are there links? are you afraid of being crazy? based on the history textbooks, i KNOW that these answers are directly under my nose, where i can't see them.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>monique delayed our donut date because of a group meeting. based on some more history textbooks, i wouldn't be surprised at all if the event ends up completely canceled, executed in every universe except this one, where i repel all the people.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>incomplete idea: going through old texts is really something. there are so many long-term things that surprise you when you find them while rummaging. i dug through my conversation with &quot;hannah&quot; and found the usual tidbits here and there. nothing big, but it IS still surprising, the things you forget.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>incomplete idea: there is no particular vibe yet permeating the final sortie. the following are not accurate: rediscovery, rebirth, renaissance.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>END</div>
<div><br/></div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>
<div>well, the donut date actually went exactly as expected, essentially actually reaching the ideal, the prime. nevertheless it was still somewhat upsetting because i remained locked the entire time. i thought it would be easier, but i am way too picky. this needs to be rectified...there will be no &quot;opportunity&quot; for this. every instance is one, i need to recognize that. i also sort of hoped she would show up at the pool, but that didn't happen. it wasn't a disappointment. dpak appeared again, though.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the next day, the ACF lock-in happened. i don't know where the term &quot;lock-in&quot; came from, but it means a group gathering exactly like the one we had so, it fit. apparently this was organized nearly exclusively by vince?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm not sure what it is i'm detecting in monique, but we're still learning about her only now, after all. when we reached chipotle, she ditched her c</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>she let me be the dj for the rest of the drive after that, something i never thought would happen. it was nighttime, and i gleefully played...nighttime music...from only two different artists, but i was still too excited. i hope i didn't let the power get to me too much. monique talks about her music a lot when she drives, naming almost every artist that comes up and what the currently playing song makes her think of, etc. then again i did the same thing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the lock-in began with a badly organized trivia game that a lot of people complained about. vince looked a little upset after it and monique had to comfort him. christina led the worship for the night. it's the first time i have sat through an ACF worship in almost two years. she has a lovely voice, a voice i almost like more than steph's. i still liked listening to steph harmonizing though, and i tried to look up and around at everybody singing instead of gluing my eyes to the lyrics sheets. it didn't really feel very magical at all. the discussion afterwards was a little bit better, but i regressed briefly and tried to show everybody a youtube video. all of the questions were oriented towards the community that ACF is and what we can do for it, and i caught an inkling of a fundamental flaw in my long-term thought pattern.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>clement then gathered us around a series of panels that were to be for our next proxe station (i don't know where that term came from either). he made us pair up and practice &quot;role-playing&quot; with each other. jared picked me and i made him practice talking to me, me being a passerby. the fact that he did so, no matter how awkward he was, makes him braver than me. the issue tackled here was on identity. i didn't quite catch all of it. clement himself was unsure of him, he admitted so as well, and his practice run with ritchie was rocky too. but no matter. i won't be participating in this, though what i am interested in is dropping by.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>after that came the live games where we got to run around the empty church. live mafia was boring and i spent an unnecessary amount of time hiding in a dark room with nobody noticing that i was missing. we played sardines after that, which was some of the most fun i can remember having, partly because it calls back to the first ACF lock-in and also because i just liked walking around the dark empty 'sanctuary' area of the building.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i was able to sleep because david had given me his sleeping bag. last time, it was cynthia. God does provide after all.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in the morning...nothing interesting happened during breakfast, the game thing afterwards, or the next worship. at around 11 am, vince announced the conclusion of the lock-in. it seemed very fitting somehow.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>again, no bonds were strengthened. maybe it's just too late in the phase for that to happen now. there are people who i feel connected with, but only when everybody else is in the room with me/us and the connection is an illusion that dissolves as soon as we are alone. there was a guy named calvin there, and i kept forgetting that he existed. he said almost nothing for the entire weekend. even i talked more. almost the same thing with the girl jennifer. i entertain this odd fantasy in which she likes me. what of j.p. though?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we had lunch very soon after breakfast on saturday, at a cantonese restaurant. i shared some things with christina from across the table, and was careful to control the elation i received whenever she laughed at one of my comments (this applies to jennifer as well). being in close proximity to her, as well as emily, brings on an illusory toxicity. all in all, the lunch was o.k. vince tried to explain the game 'snaps' to christina, and was unable to muster any enthusiasm for it. i noticed that.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and then we drove back to tech, while monique talked about her music again, and i tried just a little bit to not seem impressed. i wasn't, really. i just don't want too many songs to make me think of her or the moment. i liked several of her songs.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>handwritten: the night was supposed to be set aside for God. it was meant to be for reaching out, for this community, for US, to teach US things, and there you were thinking about nothing but you, you, you. you are incredibly selfish, aren't you?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this is yet another</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>will you EVER learn?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i've been on training wheels for four years, no, nearly TEN FUCKING years. is there a next step at all? answer of course, there must be. i foresee incredible difficulty in assuming this identity.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>after years of trying to merely COPY everybody...i will be on my own. you must have chosen this community for a reason.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>

feb 26 w</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<div>thoughts cannot be contained for longer than a day. i must remember this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i was markedly less happy during the week's small group. i asked monique if i seem date-able, and her reply could only be expected. she simply said that everybody is date-able, and that there's someone out there for me. an easy answer. a true answer? i was able to remember what we had talked about last week because i had briefly looked back on the material a couple days beforehand. only 4 people were present, including me, and i didn't do that much talking this time. i must recall the core of this week's study, and practice it if i can. find somebody to love...identify His interference. i feel like an infant for sure, and it's exasperating, frustrating, and downright embarrassing too, because everybody else seems to have grown up, leaving me behind and alone with my childish mindset. they mentioned jonathan guo, who i had just seen earlier that day. he acknowledged me but i hadn't responded apart from giving him a strange smiley look. i had basically ignored him, ignored an entire universe, as vince reminded me when he mentioned guo's &quot;struggles.&quot; everybody is a universe, and that's very hard to remember because it takes time and effort. i am very unaccustomed to putting those into my relationships, which is why nearly all of mine are completely substanceless. i don't know how to love a human being, how to see somebody. i'm overcharged on the negative aspects of loneliness. this is why it's so dangerous to forget that other people exist and are out there to be discovered. you can only supply so much to yourself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>another idea: courtesy of vince again, who believes that one shouldn't have multiple personas for different circles of friends. v agreed when i relayed the opinion to him. i have always agreed to this. actually, who wouldn't? but i put it into nonexistent practice, for i pitifully segregate my friends into tiny circles and feed each one only what i want to give. what percentage of myself am i around monique? around v? and the rest of them. maybe it's because of this that i don't know who i truly am anymore. know what i mean? i only want to be things, and AM not any of them.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday, vince texted me about &quot;food truck&quot; as he'd promised. i hadn't even heard of the food trucks until the small group, so if i hadn't gone for any reason i'd simply have gone the day without having the slightest clue. he didn't text me, though, until after he (and jennifer ma) had already gotten there. meaning they were in line by the time i got to the tech green. i don't know what's up with that, but who cares. on the way there, ritchie texted me and invited me to a mysterious lunch. i don't know what to expect, and i feel like it's part of something within ACF, maybe related to the upcoming proxe. in which case, i'll be expectedly disappointed. but i'll probably be disappointed no matter what happens because of the state of my relationship with ritchie...which is one of the ghosts. i'm thinking he'll talk to me about God, and i'm afraid that i'll be like the awkward kid again, who i find so vile and hate so much (and yet he lives in me). meanwhile, vince is not a natural to me, as i couldn't just talk to him (after jennifer left). i just ate the food that i had bought and followed him, and was perfectly glad once he left too. i returned to the ULC and stayed until the guard in-service, which a lot of the attractive girls attended. i always pay attention to nica, who didn't greet me this time (and i said nothing to her either), because she appears relatively reclusive as well, and that grants me a certain kind of comfort. a dangerous comfort. i become upset whenever she talks to someone else, something that cannot bode well for me. remember, she is a universe too. austin milton was...acting? as an instructor this time, while we were all practicing our rescues. while practicing rapid extrications, things went nowhere near as smoothly as they did last week during the workouts with yusuf, which can't be attributed solely to my actions in the water. austin was clearly doing his best to be encouraging. it didn't really work, not because he was being fake, but rather, it just didn't seem like something he was used to giving out. but good for him, right?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last thursday we gossiped about dan a. at the down table. i like it much better when he's not here.</div>

<div><br/></div><div>Today we received some attention from Mindy.

Perhaps it is because, as a guard, I am a  legitimate and functional part of the event.</li><li>But I also like the emptiness that fallows afterwards, when the entire pool deck is empty save for us. And it's night outside. I had a great time picking up the trash (I mean that sincerely) left behind and collecting the lost/found. I imagine a story behind every abandoned towel and half-filled water bottle. Pouring leftover water and tossing leftover food, though, sucks.</li><li>The best part is bucketing the deck, and watching all the hair and grime get washed away into the drain, leaving behind a shiny, much cleaner floor that I'm not afraid to step on anymore. Maybe I should do the same thing with my sins!</li><li>I tried explaining my love for the emptiness to rachel collins, and that never took off.

<en-note><div><b>2-8 m</b></div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s been a week since monique texted me out of the blue. it was something about Facebook saying that i turn 31. initially i was sure that she had messaged the wrong person by accident. whether or not that was so, i&apos;ll never know. coincidentally i had just recently reread all of the encouragement letters i had gotten from ACF and recalled what monique had written about us having her longest text conversations. i wonder if she also thought back to those times while we were exchanging texts throughout the afternoon. i had to put a positive spin on my thoughts of late that i relayed to her. we kind of went through a how-are-you-doing routine. i made sure not to seem pouty about the fact that she never paid me a visit during any of the times she came back to atlanta (i don&apos;t even know when) and she said that we should grab a drink the next time she comes. hm...</div><div><br/></div><div>the day after that i moved my computer and things to our new location at work, a more open space with individual cubicle-ets. this Bina had taken the spot in the corner that i wanted, causing me to dislike her for a little while, but i think i was able to turn myself around before long. a couple days later one morning, she asked me if i had just graduated, and i said, &quot;i wish i were that young.&quot; only for her to reveal that she herself had graduated six years ago, making her several years older than me at least assuming she&apos;s not superintelligent. i had always thought she was the one who had just graduated from school.</div><div><br/></div><div>the people at saigon basil recognize me now. i&apos;m a regular. i go there about once a month. one of the guys working there looks like enoch.</div><div><br/></div><div>DOOGIE grew up during the 80&apos;s. he&apos;s a solid ten years older than me. wow.</div><div><br/></div><div>today amber came to the gym with me and christian. i of course immediately anticipated her taking the front seat of christian&apos;s car and made a comment something like, &quot;i&apos;m being relegated to the back&quot; and amber almost seemed to feel bad. i have no way of knowing if in actuality she thought i was being bitchy. i tried to make sure i wasn&apos;t coming across that way. but on the way back she actually took the backseat. i said, &quot;you&apos;re very kind.&quot; later she announced in the workplace chatroom and she and her husband are expecting. i tried to imagine her having sex and couldn&apos;t. several people sent congrats. i thought, why do you think people will care?</div><div><br/></div><div>speaking of the gym, mark is gone now. i suppose the only way we might ever see each other again is if i ask to hang out on steam or Facebook. if i don&apos;t, i wonder if i could potentially forget about him completely until i manage to read about him again in my entries.</div><div><br/></div><div>today at whole foods i chose a checkout line with a mostly attractive white girl and a friendly-looking black cashier. the girl in front of me turned to see me and jumped. i decided not to ignore this stranger interaction and said, &quot;did i scare you?&quot; as she said she thought for a moment that i was her boyfriend. i thought, your boyfriend is asian? but instead said, &quot;i get that all the time.&quot; then her real boyfriend came by and he actually was asian, a towering tall dude with acne scars. before leaving, he acknowledged me with a nod.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>2-18 r</b></div><div><br/></div><div>amber is pregnant with her first child and i wonder what it was like to have sex with her. for some days she kept telling christian and me (or just him? anyone?) about things relating to her pregnancy, like some photo shoot she did, and i thought she had to be one of those people who just keeps talking about herself, out of the blue, with no reason to care.</div><div><br/></div><div>but later she complimented me on my progress at the gym, telling me that it&apos;s going to be a different year for me. nice of her to notice, i suppose. if only it could be true.</div><div><br/></div><div>i&apos;m noticing that it&apos;s taking me ridiculous lengths of time to prepare to leave my apartment to do anything. anything is usually grocery shopping. in fact it&apos;s only ever either grocery shopping, or to get dinner. maybe lunch on the weekends. nothing else.</div><div><br/></div><div>on sunday there was significant traffic on the way to the nearby chipotle. i noticed an ice skating rink in atlantic station. people were out there having fun. at chipotle, dani was there again. i wonder how she&apos;s evolved over the past nearly four years. she gave me my meal for free. i thought about her for the rest of the day.</div><div><br/></div><div>the guy with the slicked back hair, at papa john&apos;s. was likely getting impatient waiting for his pizza. but he remained silent as he strolled towards the inside, and somebody had to assure him that it would be ready soon. i think his shoes were a shiny black.</div><div><br/></div><div>christian seems to be somewhat out of touch with modern popular culture...pronouncing &quot;memes&quot; and &quot;mimmies.&quot; really? bringing up the beatles when discussing how trashy modern pop music is. bringing up a rather old example of a meme (i forget which). he&apos;s never seen with his phone and probably got a smartphone recently and is unfamiliar with owning one. he left it at work one day and sent me an email asking me to put it out of sight, which i didn&apos;t see until days later because it was sent to my school email. i wonder how.</div><div><br/></div><div>last summer and fall were mostly quiet afternoons.</div><div><br/></div><div>this season of early sunsets is drawing to a close now.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>2-28 n</b></div><div><br/></div><div>so, the culmination of two months, and it&apos;s been exactly like it was last year, with nothing to remember. it&apos;s also been four years since i started writing about myself at all, the first leap year since then. almost four years since monique read something of mine that almost made her cry.</div><div><br/></div><div>a little over a week ago, christian asked me how old i am. i was surprised but took my time answering because i knew i&apos;m quite a bit younger than he is. then he asked me if i&apos;ve ever had a significant other, and i was too embarrassed to answer that entirely truthfully. i said, not for a while now, which is only partially true at best. i don&apos;t remember exactly what he said after that, not fully understanding his intended message. something about not waiting. i take it as the universe giving me an impromptu reminder of the passage of time.</div><div><br/></div><div>i think this was on the same day that he became overly annoyed at car whose driver parked it too close to his, and he deliberately swung his door into its side several times to leave a visible mark. he seemed a little too satisfied with it afterwards, and during the next week proudly relayed the story to amber. i thought about cognitive reframing and how i&apos;m convinced that he would go out of his way to not practice it in situations like this.</div><div><br/></div><div>talking to christian is becoming easier now. i haven&apos;t thought about mark at all since he left. i don&apos;t know if he and christian still communicate. what either of us are to him now. any blip in the timeline? christian is now the closest thing to a friend i&apos;ve got, and what does that say? that&apos;s run through my head several times throughout the past few days. and i still won&apos;t offer to drive to the gym because i don&apos;t want to pay for parking every day.</div><div><br/></div><div>i watched nearly of &apos;bojack horseman&apos; again in a week, and if i weren&apos;t holding myself back i would have cried.</div><div><br/></div><div>bina dresses casually, slightly sloppily. i wonder what her situation is. what my voice sounds like to her. i like her better now that my initial snap judgements of her have dissolved.</div><div><br/></div><div>DOOGIE is my only other modern friend. i have to be careful.</div><div><br/></div><div>i bought a blue striped long-sleeve t-shirt from the gap the other day, a small piece of clothing that resonated. the cashier was a tall and slender woman in jeans and a white fuzzy sweater and had an accent i couldn&apos;t identify. she struck me (not literally. metaphorically?).</div><div><br/></div><div>i thought that i had watched &apos;the secret of kells&apos; way back in november of 2014, but according to my screenshots and the tumblr post i made posting them, it wasn&apos;t until last april. it hasn&apos;t been a year yet. i don&apos;t know how my memory of this became warped.</div><div><br/></div><div>i texted v a few days back. for the first time, i feel like, i&apos;m starting to become annoyed at his lack of reliable response.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div>2-1 w</div><div><br/></div><div>some things are getting out of hand. procrastination. depression. inertia. a constant &apos;one more thing&apos;. traps I refused to believe I was falling in. last month I spent over $2,000 on four t-shirts and three pairs of shoes. a pair of $400 saint laurent sneakers that I bought because alice had casually mentioned her casual sex. I don&apos;t know how I&apos;m going to get out. I think about it all the time but never do anything.</div><div><br/></div><div>I met a neighbor sometime last weekend. he came to deliver me mail that was mistakenly placed in his mailbox. I was worried that my computer volume was too loud again. because I was so surprised to see him standing there, I didn&apos;t think to ask.</div><div><br/></div><div>christian is a conundrum. there are times when he makes me feel alright and times when I can&apos;t believe a person like him can exist. I&apos;m mostly disappointed in myself when I totally fail to speak my mind to him when he says something I feel a strong reaction to. I shouldn&apos;t be this meek around someone like him. there are no better times or opportunities. I had so many this and last week to say something but I didn&apos;t. and it wasn&apos;t because I wanted to avoid some conflict. I was just too afraid.</div><div><br/></div><div>christian likes Trump, but I want to say that he really just finds it amusing that Trump&apos;s actions cause such massive reactions among people. with regards to the women&apos;s march and muslim ban, he was constantly talking about how people blew them out of proportion, how they&apos;re too caught up in &quot;feelings&quot;. offering no real defensive argument that made sense to me. something about how he speaks his mind and that he&apos;s a successful businessman.</div><div><br/></div><div>today he revealed another face of his person that probably shouldn&apos;t be that surprising. he told me that if he were a cop, he would pull someone over and deliberately keep them waiting for longer than necessary, just to make them as anxious as he could. that in a previous job where his responsibilities included some kind of performance evaluation, he did exactly that. he&apos;d watch people and act in such a manner that made them worry that they were doing something wrong. I should have said something, but I didn&apos;t.</div><div><br/></div><div>I haven&apos;t yet had a chance to bring up the idea of cognitive reframing, especially with regards to aggressive driving, but I have a feeling that he&apos;d reject it instantly. looks like all that he has to offer me is a ride and some motivation for the gym. I don&apos;t have anything for him.</div><div><br/></div><div>maybe I should just count on his actions rather than words. he doesn&apos;t deserve so much thought from me.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>2-10 f</div><div><br/></div><div>some drive-thru lady at the mcdonald&apos;s recognizes me now. she always says, &quot;see you tomorrow&quot; (or in one case, &quot;monday&quot;) after she hands me the food. I always make a point not to come the next day after that. I wonder if she recognizes other people. because I order the same thing every time I go, she recognizes that, too.</div><div><br/></div><div>this cycle of consumption, spending, hollow satisfaction, brief spike in happiness...it&apos;s so strong that it feels like it&apos;s all I&apos;ve ever known. I&apos;m more rash, impulsive, reckless, and impatient than ever. one day I skipped work so I could stay at home and accept a package that needed a signature for delivery. another day I took half of off. so it&apos;s beginning to affect that now.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;ve waited days to wash a single plate. aside from boiling some noodles for a total of under three minutes, I haven&apos;t cooked anything at all in the month that&apos;s passed since the break. the break in the routine that I&apos;ve jumped straight back into. at times I&apos;ve considered buying paper plates and plastic utensils so I won&apos;t have to wash my permanent ones. I don&apos;t want to create so much garbage though, so so far I&apos;m still able to hold off on that.</div><div><br/></div><div>I RSVP&apos;d &apos;going&apos; to another one of the Angie&apos;s meetups, but there&apos;s a 99.99% chance I won&apos;t go. it&apos;s at the joystick gamebar. I can&apos;t even picture myself socializing in such a setting now. all my conversations are purely imaginary. I keep waiting.</div><div><br/></div><div>these jeans only cost $24 more than this t-shirt. the jeans were $369 and the t-shirt $345.</div><div><br/></div><div>alice is nothing.</div><div><br/></div><div>I feel like the only thing I have passing for sanity is keeping my apartment somewhat obsessively free of clutter.</div><div><br/></div><div>now that &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE isn&apos;t available constantly, I&apos;m finding myself with much more empty time on weeknights and weekends. the problem is I have nothing to do to fill up that space. I&apos;m so accustomed to wasting it on the same thing, over and over again. looks like I&apos;m the one who was conditioned after all. should have seen that one coming. v tells me again to forget about him. I know it&apos;s the best course of action. I knew so. but I couldn&apos;t give up the fake feeling of advantageousness. now I might be too far gone...</div><div><br/></div><div>christian is getting a new car and I&apos;m only mentioning it because I wonder if it&apos;ll be some kind of mile marker for him. if his cars are attributes of his ages. it could be one for me, too. I&apos;ll try to remember the transition.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>I had lunch with some coworkers this week at la fonda, which I hadn&apos;t been to since last year with mike, so I texted him again. wonder how he feels to hear from me out of the blue. hopefully I&apos;ll see him again soon. why hopefully, I don&apos;t know.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<!DOCTYPE en-note SYSTEM "http://xml.evernote.com/pub/enml2.dtd"><en-note><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">2-6 t</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">it's still a sad time.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">last saturday I went to a dinner party at the Dorothy's house, with Cody and a handful of other people. some I recognized from the running group. others were new. no one was attractive or threatening, so I was able to remain relaxed. felt okay with doing what I do. the dinner was a hot pot, and the food was good so I was at least able to enjoy it in the midst of unfamiliar people. I'm guessing most of us were misfits to some degree. one of the guys there had picked out the hot pot ingredients, and he seemed somewhat excited about that. one of the girls was somewhat pretty, but I didn't really talk to her at all. Cody and Dorothy discussed cuckold related terminology again, which I found amusing. the short guy who looked like obama almost seemed forcibly cool, and towards the end he kept to himself, quietly reading some book. the other girl there had brought exploding kittens, but everyone wasn't very interested. I don't know why this game seems to be everywhere. I had talked to one of the guys there who mentioned doing rock climbing a couple times a week. I thought I'd found a way in, since I've been considering trying it out (but have done nothing). he offered to exchange numbers so maybe I could join him and whoever he normally climbs with, but either he forgot, or he didn't bring it up again either, because I didn't, and I don't know why.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">and last friday, nita messaged me, telling me some inspiring stuff about settings goals. it was a little out of the blue, but still appreciated because I didn't think I'd hear from her for a while. our conversations feel forced now.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><hr /><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">2-11 n</span></div></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">Barbara was actually at the running meetup yesterday. I arrived there late, ran on my own, and saw Cody talking to her. the Dorothy and David were there too.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">when I first saw Barbara I said an artificially enthusiastic hey! to her and that was it. I was afraid to try talking to her more so I stuck by Cody and kept pointing out how steam was coming from his shirt.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">at jason's deli I sat amongst the Barbara, Cody, Dorothy, Jay, David, and the girl I saw at the hot pot dinner at Dorothy's house, whose name is spelled Tia. one of the Marks was there too, and he and Barbara seemed to get along just fine. I have no idea how they've interacted since november. Cody mentioned that I had been in one of his dreams, in which I was running for my life away from him. the conversation between the rest of us with Dorothy turned to dating and her experiences with weird guys. my contributions were mostly just interjections with small quips. I once said I wanted to meet one of the guys she was describing, and she pointed out that it was so I could see how not to be, and she was right. they talked a lot about how they expect and prefer guys and girls to behave. they all have experience. eventually I dropped out almost completely, and just sat there silently.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">I kept catching Tia's eye and my thoughts turned. maybe she likes me. but she probably doesn't.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">Barbara mentioned casually dating someone who's 34, divorced with kids. but also that she's single. is this important?</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">Tia and I talked briefly about the parts of china my parents and she were from. she eventually turned away because I was speaking too quietly. it's still intimidating to just have a one-on-one conversation with someone. the idea of taking charge of the conversation is so alien to me.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">the David disagreed with Dorothy's position that there should be set rules as to who should pay for a first date. as the conversation went on, he kept insisting on writing a book about Dorothy's strange dates, and began planning out chapters. then explicitly said to Tia that she's hot, in front of us all, which was unexpected. I don't know how the others received that.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">at the end, Dorothy and maybe Jay mentioned doing a pub crawl next week for chinese new year. the others exchanged numbers and Barbara went around getting everyone's names. when she got to me she said, "we met last time" and I said nothing.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">after I left I kept thinking of all the different things I could have said to Barbara. not even anything that would have made me seem cool, just something more interactive.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">at one point Tia mentioned hanging out somewhere with Dorothy and somebody, meaning I'm not really part of their friend circle.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><hr /><div><b>2-14 w</b></div></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div>I've slipped a couple times into thinking my relationship with nita was basically dead, but unexpectedly she injects effort into it every now and then. somehow I'm comfortable enough with her to open up to her about certain things that I've never told anyone else. including the fact that I've never dated anyone, the things in life I'm scared about doing, the recent incident with the Gorm. is it an effect she has on me? or just that I don't care what she thinks? because I don't feel the need to present any image of myself to her. no need to hide from her.</div><div><br /></div><div>she's messaged me to tell me things like to make a list of goals, encouraging me to go out and experience life, but also not quite sugarcoating everything and telling me things that are harder to hear. although it's not like it's anything I didn't already know. in my mind, but not my heart. or some bullshit like that. I could feel that the things she told, while they matched with the things I mechanically tell myself, didn't sync up with what I was hoping to hear, a little deeper down. however I believe her words are true. and her willingness to tell me such things is valuable to me. keep her around...!</div><div><br /></div><div>today I messaged several people wishing them a happy valentine's day. nita encouraged me to attend some speed dating event, but I didn't listen. she herself is on a date with someone, she says. I wonder if that could have been me, if I had wanted, and tried.</div><div>the Kumar at work has been here for about two weeks, and is leaving tomorrow. I wanted to judge him in so many ways, and he only became cool after he helped me.</div><div><br /></div><div>today I dropped off over $600 of underwear at the h&amp;m in atlantic station, as a clothing "donation". they gave me coupons. I hadn't set foot in that store since mid-2015. much of the underwear I had only worn one time.</div><div><br /></div><div>today cody and I connected on steam. we had some difficulty because he gave me his steam account name instead of his profile name. I had mentioned the speed dating event to him earlier.</div><div><br /></div><div><hr /><b>2-19 m</b></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div>last week I bought a ticket to the lights concert at center stage, a venue that I've driven past multiple times when it was busy with a long line of people snaking out around the block. tomorrow I plan to go it alone, as both Zach and nita bailed on me after expressing interest. they both gave me the same excuse, that they couldn't afford it. somehow I was more willing to give Zach a pass on that one. nita seemed more disingenuous to me. first telling me that she'd want to go because it'd be fun to hang out with me, and even asked if her cousin could come along. then canceled it all. at least I saw it coming.</div><div><br /></div><div><hr /><b>2-21 w</b></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div>yesterday:</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>I was so anxious about going to the concert alone that I actually felt a sort of dread in the morning when I woke up. I was prepared to leave work early to get there before the doors opened, but started reading about how long the opening acts typically took, so I planned to get there some time later instead. I drove past the venue on the way home. people were waiting and the line was already curling around the building.</div><div><br /></div><div>nita messaged me again wishing me fun. I called an uber and rode over to the place. the line was mostly gone.</div><div><br /></div><div>I stepped inside alone. I was wearing the swirly-skulls amq t-shirt so I'd feel better. didn't bother with any drinks or food, found an entrance to the stage area and followed someone in. there were rows of seats surrounding a central area for people to stand in.</div><div>(giving up describing the flow of events)</div><div><br /></div><div>the thing I'm feeling upset about now is that there's no noticeable afterglow. after an all-new experience that I was hoping, expecting to feel profound, I feel nothing. and I know why. it overshadowed all of the awe, that I did feel in the moment but that was also being pushed aside the whole time. I never said a single word to anyone while I was in there. I did move my body, but was never completely free. I didn't sing, or jump, or scream. just swayed for the most part with my arms hanging. I took some pictures of videos. not many people were active, which kept making me feel better. I stuck around this one other person who seemed to be by himself too, just singing along and having his own time.</div><div><br /></div><div>I have to really think hard to recall the fleeting emotions that briefly activated inside me. when the lights first dimmed, when she appeared onstage, when I saw fiery hair looking just like it does in the artwork and videos. the show lasted about an hour and a half, and I have to concentrate so hard on the fact that I saw this artist live and was part of the crowd for all that time. logically I know it happened, but I just feel the same. if it weren't for the photos I took and the poster I bought, it would have been like I never went anywhere. I tried expressing this notion to 1. cody, who either doesn't understand or didn't take me seriously, and 2. nita, who empathized somewhat and reassured me. she also opened up to me a bit more about her personal life, revealing details that I hadn't known previously and which completely voided my own problems. she told me her mom died in a car accident that left her dad paralyzed, when she was 9 or 10. and I knew I could never understand that sort of wave.</div><div><br /></div><div>this wall, this haze, that's preventing from fully feeling and experiencing. I didn't want to admit it to nita, but she was still able to identify the source herself without even a hint. I was missing others to enjoy with. it's like there exists neither a natural nor engineered solution to this problem. the whole time I spent standing on the floor, I was trying to convince, to force myself to be okay for just this little while. when really my attention was on how dead I am inside, and unfortunately this was not a type of escape I could use.</div><div><br /></div><div>there were times when a song came on and I became genuinely excited. all I could do was smile, and I wasn't okay with that. how do I learn to be?</div><div><br /></div><div>lights is just a person (and more, I know, but also just a person) and I was with a couple hundred other people sharing her presence for a night. she chatted a bit here and there between songs. smiled and laughed. why is having been there so hard to recall? I kept saying to nita and cody that it felt like I was never even there. is this going to get better anytime soon?</div><div>everything was quiet when it ended.</div><div><br /></div><div><hr /><b>2-24 s</b></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div>yesterday I gave a "demo" to the other guys at the office, showing them something I'd worked on. the Anthony kept telling me to take charge and the J.P./John Park said that I needed to put "more bass in [my] voice." I knew I was being quiet and their comments made me self-conscious, but they were right. I don't think I could ever be a commanding leader.</div><div><br /></div><div>today Dorothy showed up at the running meetup, and I ended up sticking around with her, Cody, the David, the Barbie, a Kayla, and a Ben (the hot pot guy from a few weeks ago). Barbie seems to get along just fine with the older Mark, and the big tall white guy who lived in china for some years and who I still have never talked to was here again too. I feel like I wouldn't have had as good a time at henry's if he were there too. I'm not as charismatic and am just so easily ignored. rarely contributing to conversation. and possibly looking as though I feel that the others aren't "good enough" for me? tried to not stare for too long at Barbie because I still don't know how to talk to her. the David and the others started planning a camping trip somewhere up north in a few weeks. I want to be included.</div><div>cody mentioned one of the girls he'd met at the sushi hangout last week, that I had refused to join, invited him to her birthday party which would be at a skating rink. the activity made me regret not going even more.</div><div><br /></div><div>I had left my phone in my car and I didn't take it with me to henry's, so I have no pictures of the hangout today.</div><div><br /></div><div><hr /><b>2-28 w</b></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div>yesterday nita unexpectedly asked me to lunch. I'd been half expecting her to cancel dinner on me again, and maybe this was her way of doing it. it's been nearly two months since the last time I saw her. and it was a little sad how uncomfortable I still felt around her, despite how comfortable I always think I am while talking to her on messenger. she threw me off with some of the things she said; at one point she began trying to explain pointers in c++ to me, but wasn't very coherent. she works in development too, but didn't know how to say "terabyte" properly when referring to her computer's storage capacity; she hesitantly said "tetta...?" instead. and she assumed that I have netflix installed on my phone like anyone else would, for when they want to watch while in bed.</div><div><br /></div><div>nita ordered three dishes for herself, intending to share with me I guess. one was an order of dumplings, almost all of which she just let me eat because she didn't like them. and then she payed for the whole meal, which made me uncomfortable although I didn't even try to get the waittress to take my card too. she used a debit card. said she owed me for backing out of going to the concert.</div><div>in the evening I ran into an older-middle-aged guy in the elevator who had just gotten food from a place across the street. he started talking to me a little bit about it. maybe he was lonely. coming home with take-out food for himself? or maybe he just saw that I was carrying food too.</div><div><br /></div><div>another thing I noticed last saturday is that when I'm feeling bad, I start grasping at people's flaws, looking for anything to bring them down in my own mind.</div><div><br /></div><div>~</div><div><br /></div><div>nita noticed my haircut and said it looked good. instead of leaving it at that or asking her to elaborate, I brought up a conversation we had in december about hair product, as my way of delaying silence.</div><div><br /></div></en-note>      ]]>

; 1-1 tues
<div><br/><div>i just remembered that i'll have to write as many as 750 words every day starting from today if i want to stick to the &quot;resolution&quot;. this is going to be hard.</div><div><br/></div><div>DREAMER: i remember so little of this. monique was in it, but i don't remember a single thing about what she did. i was also in a small greenhouse, when i saw a smoker drop down from the ceiling. i was holding the old logitech mouse i'm using now to aim at it and snare it with a smoker tongue. i watched it struggle in irony. that's literally all i remember about the dream now.</div><div><br/></div><div>i think about anjaly a lot. sometimes i even picture her naked. i think it's weird that i do that even though i don't think of her that way. i don't have a crush on her i'm not in love with her. but i really want her and i hope she wants me too. she's the only person i really texted this break, and i'm not sure how interested in me she is. i always play out conversations in my head between me and her. i actually really want to talk to her all the time, but when we actually are together i completely fail with my words.</div><div><br/></div><div>michael stopped by our house to drop charles off here. he came over to where i was sitting and asked &quot;what are you playing..bioshock..? wait no it isn't&quot; and i told him no it was. what an insincere question. it made me not want to talk to him and the rest of these friends. my parents tried to convince them to stay and play cards, something they obviously had zero intention of doing. i don't know why bothered yelling after them to come back and play, even after they were already out the door and walking to their car. i think that once, i would have wanted them to stay longer too, because it would mean a longer &quot;party&quot;. but not now. then anjaly told me that she was at WaHo, and i wanted to go out to eat somewhere too. only i had no friends to go with like she probably did, and my parents wanted to sleep and were afraid that it'd be too dangerous to go out to drive right then i felt a little upset that i couldn't do the same thing she was, until she said i could simply raid my fridge, and then i felt better just staying at home. watching the times square ball drop on NBC had never so insignificant. i felt sad. nothing felt different or official, and i wasn't expecting anything to. i woke up at 2:30 this morning.</div><div><br/></div><div>'Zoro (witch hunter)' wished me a happy new year. i played a l4d2 game with her yesterday.</div><div><br/></div><div>now i will see how long i can go without ever interacting with anyone on facebook.</div><div><br/></div><div>tom and i have yet to hang out again. i know that if we don't, it won't be because of him, but because of me.</div><div><br/></div><div>big, grand things, like the white house, a battleship, a cruise ship, the pentagon, the burj khalifa, and a big passenger jet.</div><div><br/></div><div>my dad is running on the treadmill downstairs. the last time i remember him running on a treadmill was maybe ten years ago in our old barn swallow house on an old treadmill with the green key and speed dial.</div><div><br/></div><div>i still need to work on writing clean, straight and true. the one thing i had in mind to write about today was anjaly, and that paragraph about her ended up being very short.</div><div><br/></div><div>this always happens whenever i make one of my short-lived resolutions to write 750 daily. my thoughts are too scattered and i write a line about each of them.</div><div><br/></div><div>i've been home for long enough now to know i won't be as glad to be back at school as i thought i'd be at the beginning of break. classes will start right away, i don't know when i'll get to talk to anjaly, i don't know how i'm going to break away from ACF, and i don't know how i'm going to join other organizations to facilitate that. i always thought i could ask her what she's part of, and then join those. like china care. but that sort of planning never works. it's too incomplete. so what am i going to do? go places by myself?</div><div><br/></div><div>2012 is over. for some reason it felt like a final year. it must have been the whole december 21st thing.</div></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 1-2 wed</div><div><br/></div><div>now before i start writing this i would just like to</div><div><br/></div><div>some things i observed today are that my brother spends so much time in front of his computer that it he looks out of place sitting at the kitchen table, that i have dreamt about steph a LOT, and that i only have 3 days left at home. brother had school and dad had work, so the house was still quiet when i got up at 1:30. i woke up after a particularly angry and disgusting dream that i don't want to remember. it was filled with..several things of times long gone. i don't why they showed up in my sleep. then i searched my dream entries for &quot;steph&quot; and found that she's been in at least one dream of mine per month for almost every month since i started recording what goes on in my sleep (16 out of 20). i still like thinking about her, but in much more primitive senses.</div><div><br/></div><div>it's so easy to give up on this, but i just don't know what else is on my mind. there's literally nothing else i have to say tonight. how are things going to get any more eventul once school starts again.</div><div><br/></div><div>these were hoidays, that were supposed to have just passed. winter holidays. the holiday season, once that lasts supposedly for over a whole month, and it just ended. i think i just missed out again. i didn't really try to make myself happy. i struggle to keep reminding myself that happiness is a choice. i don't think i'm making a conscious effort to choose it though. sometimes, when i look at the facebook ACF group and read the things that david posts, i think that maybe he's wrong. or not wrong, but i just don't have to listen to him. look at how immersed he's become in our culture. the kind i once eagerly identified with, and still do but no longer wish to. the thing is that i have no friends who also want to break apart from this. it's just me, and a handful of others who were never involved. the only different person i can think of v, and he's in london and we're never together. besides him, there are all of the barcelona people, none of whom i can call my friends now. it's rather regrettable. yet another missed opportunity. sometimes i consider not bothering trying to keep the regina spektor to barcelona association in my head, but if it weren't for that i'd never even feel like listening to her album 'far'. patrick is gone. tyler. urvashi. is it my own fault that all of my friends go from me?</div><div><br/></div><div>i would love for 2013 to be full of newness and beginnings, but just thinking about the tech environment makes the possibility seem so bleak and it's depressing. i'm afraid i'm going to sink into old routines again, revert to the same habits and attitudes, and that i won't accomplish anything NEW. what that would call for is daring. i have to threaten myself with unromanticized versions of my future. ACF has gotten me nowhere, right? i've done a lot of hoping and stupidly stuck to them. no, they definitely didn't help me. i have wavered around deciding to go or not go to their small groups this time. i think i will settle on no. i used to go to multiple meetings a week. they accomplished nothing as well. what is it i'm wasting? i'd like to stop wasting it. time, mental energy, social energy.</div><div><br/></div><div>as if buying the CD will make the music on it any better</div><div><br/></div><div>when thinking about going back to school still all i think about is anjaly.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 1-3 thurs</div><div><br/></div><div>gah, looking back at the things i said just yesterday almost disgusts me at how stupid it all already sounds. i really don't want to force words out. it just doesn't work...</div><div><br/></div><div>today i watched 'les miséables' a second time, with v. this time i caught many more words in the songs and followed along with the movie's quicker moments much better. and i also felt some more of the emotion. particularly during the character éponine's soliloquy, which i paid more attention to. a couple people behind us went &quot;aww&quot; several times. then i teared up and almost cried at the end when valjean died, and i was so happy. for a few moments i thought about how great it'd be to be able to put emotion into language as finely tuned and exquisite as the music's lyrics. think about how far this writing is from that. as soon as the movie ended v got up and said let's go. it may have been a little too long for him, but now that i think of it maybe he was anxious about his parents wanting him to be back home. we started talking stupidly again as soon as we walked out. i wonder if i'll stay interested enough to try to take on the novel now.</div><div><br/></div><div>before all that i picked up my brother from high school for the first time. he had a friend with him, who i dropped off at his house. i wonder what he thought of me and my brother not talking, or me not saying anything to him. it wouldn't have been any different if it was a girl instead. there was nothing special about going to see the school. it really was a burning field.</div><div><br/></div><div>my dad has a limp. he's getting old. should i be feeling sorry? or use the image to remind myself to work hard and exercise? i don't want to look at him, but how can i step on him like that? i don't want to talk about my dad anymore. on the short car rides home when i pick him up from the bus stop i can't wait until we get home because then he will just start talking with my mom. familial relationships a failure. i feel awful sometimes.</div><div><br/></div><div>and i wish and hope my brother will stop appearing in my dreams.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 1-4 fri</div><div><br/></div><div>day 3 and the streak is already broken.</div><div><br/></div><div>i couldn't name a favorite part of 'les misérables' when v asked me what mine was. i think i just didn't want to admit what they were and why. i would have said that my favorite parts were éponine's solo and the ending as valjean is dying. because those two parts were the saddest and made me cry, almost. i asked v if he cried when valjean died, because i wanted to tell him that i did. i don't know why. not a big deal, but i wish i hadn't.</div><div><br/></div><div>'Mizz Bubble PopX' makes me think of melissa picirillo, and i played with a user whose gamertag began with &quot;andy&quot; and ended with random numbers, but anyway that made me think of melissa and andy. when our match ended she said she was going to quit the game and go to sleep but didn't. i saw her online and still playing. liar.</div><div><br/></div><div>:gap:</div><div><br/></div><div>winter: i stopped playing l4d2 for the most part. my brother sits in the dining room in front of his computer nearly literally all day, never moving, always clicking madly. i visited my dad's workplace with him for a few days and getting such little sleep made me feel a bit sick for a day. i only read one book, 'the perks of being a wallflower' (i actually read 'matilda' also, but that was in one sitting and i've read it before and i'm not going to tell people that). i only got to see v twice and tom once. the rest of the time i was sitting in my house. i never went shopping with my mom. i didn't do much to celebrate the holidays.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 1-5 sat</div><div><br/></div><div>i'm not going to get to play with v today. the atmosphere is feeling all dusky and sun-setting again because my break is over. elsewhere the sun is still shining brightly because other people will still have break for another couple weeks. i'm really sad to leave home again. i don't remember if i felt this way the previous two years. staying here did feel temporary, but i don't feel the same way about my tech dorm as i did when i left in december. now i just feel disgust at the thought of going back to my tech routines. study harder, even if i'm not interested, do whatever it takes, cut down distractions, grow my mind.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 1-7 mon</div><div><br/></div><div>i had no feelings yesterday. none during my last lunch at home, while driving to the airport, while in the air (besides a few very strong barcelona flashbacks), on the subway, or the tech trolley. v and i texted back and forth for a while.</div><div><br/></div><div>last night i felt ready to go insane. i'm afraid that my loneliness is starting to break me. i don't know how much longer i can hold it. now i feel like i've just loaded an old save slot into my memory. all unsaved winter break progress will be lost. crying, i click 'ok'. and the numbness returns.</div><div><br/></div><div>the first person i recognize that i saw was andrew, and i prepared for questions about break and to say hi to him , only he just gave me a really confused look so i avoided his gaze after that. then i saw helen and kelly walking outside the ULC, and i was only happy to see helen. talking to sam is still a little bit hard, but i was still happy to see someone more familiar on my evening back. i left my dorm keys at home though, so i have to wait for those to come in the mail. my mom is sending me my passport too, in case i actually get to go to london to visit v, which is very exciting to think about.</div><div><br/></div><div>i just want to talk to anjaly now, but i know i'm going to get so nervous as soon as i see her. all i text her about now is &quot;playing&quot;. and i keep going over in my head things to say to her.</div><div><br/></div><div>v is on a 747 flying towards london now.</div><div><br/></div><div>i'm fondly thinking of the time sidney led me in some kind of waltz while i was drunk at the black sheep. afterwards i dropped my glass and spilled sangria on her.</div><div><br/></div><div>:gap:</div><div><br/></div><div>my time with anjaly was like the same way it always has been. i thought about how different the way i talk with her is from the way i talk to v. i wonder if i'll ever meet a girl who i am able talk to the way i talk to v. my voice became hollow sandpaper again. i had to repeat myself several times. she kept seeing people she knows. two of them stayed with us for a little while. one was an asian kid named jason, who seemed completely normal, in an rather dull way. the other was also an asian kid named clarence, who spoke with a british accent that i thought was authentic at first. he kept hugging her and it was apparent that they have known each other for a while and are easy around each other. i thought the two of them could look like a cute couple. while the two of them were there with us i didn't really say anything, and anjaly even apologized for that. i felt a little bit better when we went up to the CULC rooftop. i don't like the way i think i look, walking beside her with my entire body limp. i asked her to get drunk with me and she said okay. not sure what i was trying to accomplish with that.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 1-8 tues</div><div><br/></div><div>maybe, there isn't that big a shortage of people i recognize, but i never go up and say hi to any of them. like i saw hannah at the student center sitting by herself, and ignored her. i think i once would have walked up to her and talked to her. i asked sam to eat dinner with me, but again i don't know what's going to happen. in the end, i always feel lonely. i asked him because i didn't want to feel lonely. most days nothing will go on with me. yet i'm so scared to change it.</div><div><br/></div><div>:gap:</div><div><br/></div><div>sam called me for dinner and i decided to quit my L4D2 game with Zoro the witch hunter and join him, steph, ritchie, and david. i didn't hug any of them. we ate sandwiches and then walked around target. i almost bought a lego and a copy of 'pat the bunny' but changed my mind. i felt inadequate when we looked at shirts and hats. i thought steph looked nice with a hat on. i didn't know what kind of hat it was. no one said anything when we walked past the bras section. i wonder what it was like for david and steph when they met and started to grow close to each other. the whole time i felt slightly annoyed just being with them, and david with the way he talks to me and sometimes headbutts me. i only half-smiled when i smiled and half-laughed when i laughed and half-spoke when i talked. maybe it's because by restricting my language around them, my overall behavior is being choked up as well, and i just can't loosen myself up nearly enough to breathe freely around them.</div><div><br/></div><div>later monique came to our room to play a card game with us, and i didn't get to hug her either. i didn't even hug anjaly yesterday when i hung out with her.</div><div><br/></div><div>i messaged patrick on facebook and asked him to get me a bottle of vodka and he said sure. he took a long time to reply to my opening &quot;i've been getting strong barcelona flashbacks&quot;. i'm afraid that we're just no longer interested in being friends anymore.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 1-9 wed</div><div><br/></div><div>this morning richard wan was walking with a group of his buddies so i slowed my pace down when i saw them so i could go to networking class with him. only to ditch him when i saw ethan, who i sat next to this time. he wasn't talking with anyone, so maybe the person he seemed to know that i saw him talking with on monday dropped the class or something.</div><div><br/></div><div>i just read this on zenhabits.net: &quot;When you see your friends, hug them.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>visiting the campus barnes &amp; noble, i felt a small temptation to check out a random, new paperback book and read it. exiting, i saw tam and ryan on the opposite side of the street. ryan said hey to me and i smiled at myself because it was funny that he bothered to say hi.</div><div><br/></div><div>i was walking down some stairs when i thought about how unable to adequately interact with people i am. it really struck me, and i thought about how it was the sort of thing people on tumblr are likely to post. i think tumblr is like a blood clot. it will ruin me.</div><div><br/></div><div>now i'm Just Sitting Here hoping anjaly will answer me again</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 1-10 thurs</div><div><br/></div><div>i think it's stupid to keep mentioning everybody i know who i encounter while walking.</div><div><br/></div><div>but i did see hannah at subway, and i finished my sandwich and left before she could come over to my table (i think she saw me too). but now she's at sbux too and i might just go say hi because jane said hi to me while i was waiting in the post office line. she was more excited than i was expecting, but we didn't talk for long.</div><div><br/></div><div>i hope to play with Zoro the witch hunter today so i can tell her that i'll miss playing with her, because uninstalling the game is the only way to get rid of that distraction.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 1-11 fri</div><div><br/></div><div>i don't have much to say to ethan. cecili, who is in my algorithms class, actually sat next to me but we ended up ignoring each other. i don't think she's stupid enough to genuinely not notice me for the whole time. that was somewhat saddening. i don't really care about her though.</div><div><br/></div><div>ACF is no different from what it has been. when enoch announced that for this semester they would be focusing on evangelism, i thought it sounded like something he'd have said several times by now, this whole today-we-will-be-focusing-on thing. it just didn't sound like anything new or different. i found it amusing that jose fell asleep while enoch was speaking, and i saw someone else looking at facebook on his phone. i started looking at my phone too. diana and i didn't really say anything. i didn't sign up for small groups, but did fill out one of their forms with &quot;bogus information&quot;. monique said i look cute when i smile, and she gave me a hug when i asked for one. i haven't hugged anyone else. at dinner i sat next to jennifer, with whom i exchanged random tidbits of talk while being all giggly. monique too. i stayed at center street for a while, but left only saying bye to sam. the others,</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 1-14 mon</div><div><br/></div><div>i skipped two days and that already makes it hard to rekindle my mind. i'm tired, my eyes hurt, and the thought of beginning my algorithms homework is intolerable. i'm tired of texting sam and the thought of asking him &quot;what are you doing right now?&quot; or &quot;where are you right now?&quot; makes me hurt too. right now, the person next to me is reading an economics textbook and highlighting things. a girl across from me is reading 'the fellowship of the ring' and another girl is sitting cross-legged and eating a sandwich with stringy, stretchy cheese that she had to pull on with her teeth. two guys are discussing work or business-related, both with thin macbooks, they were looking at each other's macbooks. i'm willing arcade fire to pulse through my soul. i do my favorite writing, wording, i think, when i'm tired and it'd be better if i was semi-drunk too.</div><div><br/></div><div>:gap:</div><div><br/></div><div>i don't know how to put my sad feelings in words anymore, and it's going to take a lot of effort to sufficiently transcribe it all down. somehow. not saying i will, because i don't think i can. i'm just thinking about how little i've done and how hard it seems to change my course. i can't create music, i don't want to create pictures, and i can't speak any other languages. i'm inconceivably naive when it comes to human relationships. i hate david sometimes. my fantasies are hopelessly far from becoming reality. i'm inactive. i'm too afraid to be honest, and not strong enough to be otherwise. i'm harming myself. painting a smile on my face for other people and pretending i have no fears is getting annoying, but i'm sure i'm not the only one who does that, to a degree. i can't write with or without music in my ears. i'm having a long, bad spell here. tumblr is stupid.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 1-15 tues</div><div><br/></div><div>today i'm sitting in a back corner of the class because i don't want to be in the middle. anjaly passed me in the hallway, and the unexpected sighting coupled with my stalling mind meant i just watched her as my heart stopped. then she glanced back, saw me, asked why i didn't say hi, and left before i answered, and people stared. i wouldn't be surprised if my face went pink. oh, no.</div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday's night was perfectly calm, but i spent it tossing and turning in my mind's crevices. i had a rough night, i want to say. i was being toyed with by a stormy sea. you know, one of those instances when you're so absorbed into a fantasy of yours, and something catches the corner of your eye, knocking the wind out of you the way a sudden noise jolts your brain awake from a half-asleep state. the dream collapses, hell opens up underneath.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 1-16 wed</div><div><br/></div><div>it's funny that some nights i lay in bed wondering what it'd be like to write for a living, while lately i've had so little to say to myself. the only word i said to mike today was &quot;class&quot; after he told me he was going to play a piano and i wondered what does that have to do with me? anjaly clearly wasn't interested in talking to me last night. why has it taken me so long to realize that &quot;what's up with you?&quot; is an insincere question? i feel alienated from everyone that i used to know. by doing that, i don't think i've EVER been more alone. i hope i won't begin to WANT to play L4D2 online for the occasional player interaction.</div><div><br/></div><div>:gap:</div><div><br/></div><div>i ran into mike a second today and we ate at subway together. i had already decided upon eating there, but i wonder if mike's impromptu choosing to eat there with me was akin to how i sometimes go out of my original way to accompany someone somewhere. i think Zoro the witch hunter likes playing L4D2 with me. she quit the game after i did because no one else was playing.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 1-17 thurs</div><div><br/></div><div>i had a dream with anjaly in it. it wasn't about her, but i don't think i've ever had a dream with her in it before.</div><div><br/></div><div>in my effort to expand my horizons, i thought about going to the china care meeting i received an email about, but the thought of seeing anjaly, and maybe jennifer, surrounded by even more people i don't know scares me. plus i'll be arriving alone. i want to ask jennifer about it now, maybe tomorrow, but even that's easier said than done. i hope i'm not developing a crush on anyone.</div><div><br/></div><div>just as i was about to respond &quot;join&quot; on ACF's proxe station event, i saw anjaly up top on the &quot;going&quot; list and i felt that horrible kick. i don't want to text her again until she, if ever, texts me first, but i've yet to keep a sort of promise like this.</div><div><br/></div><div>from twelfthsubwaycar:</div><div><br/></div><div>i’m so goddamn scared i won’t find my person.</div><div><br/></div><div>i just watched 2 days in paris, and even though marion and jack weren’t able to work things out, they loved each other, and were themselves with each other. they trusted each other with their personalities and their impulses and nuttiness. they weren’t afraid of being rejected when they started doing something unexpected.</div><div><br/></div><div>now i’m watching like crazy, which is another movie with two people that have found each other and go out on a limb and put their very persons in each others hands… put is the wrong word. they toss themselves at each other, wishing and dreaming that it’ll be caught by the other.</div><div><br/></div><div>i have yet to find a special connection with a person that makes me feel like i can be so open about myself… not only with romantic relationships (although, that is my #1 fear, and probable self-fulfilling prophecy), but even with friendships. i overanalyze, and try too much to view myself from others’ shoes. i shouldn’t care. i should toss my person into the wind, hoping that it falls into someone’s hands but not minding if it doesn’t. but i can’t. i really can’t. what if the other person starts to laugh, and i’m not?</div><div><br/></div><div>i know i should be more brave and confident. i know it, no one needs to tell me that in a consoling post. sometimes i just get overwhelmed with fear and loneliness that my breath catches in my throat, right above and to the right of my heart which is slowing and steadying, but then racing and thumping again. on and off. on and off. tears come, but just a little. i catch them, soaking them back in through my eyelids and lashes. my head is full of them, sloshing around like a giant lake.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 1-18 fri</div><div><br/></div><div>Lost, again, is a fitting way to put the way i've been feeling in recent days. oftentimes i'm certain that i will lose all momentum. i wait to come to a full stop, and i get scared because i don't know what i'm going to do when it happens. but i keep getting little bursts forward, tiny bits. i don't know when they'll run out. today's push was a conversation with monique, again, at ACF's proxe hot chocolate station. i think she could be magical. she said several things to me. when she asked me how i've been, i took the chance to say Anxious, but was then unable to answer why. she knew that it was because of People, though. then she prayed for me, my hands in hers. and then we hugged. i wanted to tell her i love her, but i just said &quot;i appreciate you&quot; instead. she had seen the screenshot i'd posted of my google search of &quot;how to tell if you're depressed&quot; and that made her sad. since she reminded me that someone still reads what i post, i again want to keep posting things to tumblr now, for i had been considering stopping, and even deleting my account. she also said i'm a special friend to her, something i've always hoped i was. i still fail to see just how that is because of how rarely we see each other, and how more rarely we talk. but i really want it to hold true. on a small board propped up on an easel were a hundred post-it notes, on which people who passed by had written what they want in life. i wrote &quot;Monique&quot; on one and stuck it there, with another post-it still covering the one i had written on so she wouldn't see it until later. i left one underneath too, so it was 3 stickies thick. hopefully they won't discard it upon seeing the front blank one because of how thick it is. i hope she sees. maybe she can guess that that was me. the whole little thing made me once again want to stay with ACF, at least for select people like mo, and david, who said he missed me. a week truly feels like a long time to be apart from them. i had to sincerely say yes when she asked if i would come to ACF tonight. i had thought about skipping earlier today because i just wanted to play L4D2. i told sam about how much time i've spent playing, mentioning that maybe i should have someone change my steam password, and he offered to, but since i don't want to trust him with it (not that he's untrustworthy) i didn't say anything else about it.</div><div><br/></div><div>i decided that helen is nice, and sort of funny because of how awkward she is and how she doesn't know what to do when people say or do random things in front of her. mike asked to eat lunch with me, but i left to pick up packages from the post office and he was gone when i returned. i attributed today's sunniness, after all of this week's rain, to god.</div><div><br/></div><div>i didn't see anjaly there, which was completely expected. maybe she stopped by earlier. maybe she never came at all. i don't know why she would, because she's not part of ACF in any way. why did she respond to the facebook event?</div><div><br/></div><div>i hope i dream about monique tonight.</div><div><br/></div><div>:gap:</div><div><br/></div><div>after getting to ACF late, i sat there and said nothing during these &quot;discussion questions&quot; because i didn't want to have to think up anything sincere to say to the rest of them. then i walked out, made my first call to lucky buddha of the year, and ate dinner by myself. monique texted me to come to the center street activity room. i had asked david to tell me when they all got back, and can't be sure if monique actually wanted me to come too.</div><div><br/></div><div>three artists i really want to fall in love with currently are arcade fire, beirut, and regina spektor. david came by and teased me about writing literally seconds ago, asking me who i'm writing about, and it's funny because i actually wrote a lot about somebody today. this emotion comes in such small bursts at a time, and incredibly rarely, and resonates within me for much longer than it should. i don't really care about anjaly now, but i don't know how long i can afford to keep doing so.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 1-22 tues</div><div><br/></div><div>i shouldn't have said &quot;i appreciate you&quot; to monique again in text. one reason is that now i can't post &quot;i wanted to tell her i love her, but i just said 'i appreciate you' instead&quot; to tumblr. i got almost a rebuff from her in response, a warning, that i had practically seen coming. monique said to be careful and she's nothing more than a friend. that was good because i was coming dangerously close to toying with the idea of her being more. no one can be my &quot;fix,&quot; i guess. i wonder if she had me in mind in one of her tumblr posts that i have just read.</div><div><br/></div><div>this weekend i ended up asking her to change my steam password in an effort to rid myself of my biggest time waster yet. she did, so i'm cut off from my online L4D2 buddies just as i was beginning to actually talk to them over voice chat and such. at least 2 weeks. i hope i don't get replaced in their books, but in the end they won't matter anyway. it just would have been nice.</div><div><br/></div><div>mo also showed me a wong fu video about a &quot;lost fish.&quot; after i watched it i listened to &quot;Lost!&quot; by coldplay.</div><div><br/></div><div>i think this morning i felt god tugging at me again. i've begun to turn over in my head again how easy, and safe, life as the ACF people know it seems to be.</div><div><br/></div><div>patrick did nought but like my little birthday post. pathetic, now.</div><div><br/></div><div>:gap:</div><div><br/></div><div>i guess anjaly just takes the bus regularly. she saw me at the stop, and i found it easier to talk because i don't care as much. i don't care about hanging out with her anymore. all i want are my books back.</div><div><br/></div><div>and if that's so, then why i do keep mentioning her in my mind?</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>

; 1-25 fri</div><div><br/></div><div>all i can think about for tonight is talking to monique. this happened in 5 minutes, in one afternoon. i injected her into me. i'd very much like to talk to her. to ask her things. yesterday i watched 'the perks of being a wallflower'. it was a sweet movie, but not that well done. who is logan lerman? it made me Nostalgic For Things That Never Happened. i googled those terms, and came up with the words longing, yearning, wistful, and melancholy. it's not sadness i like so much, it's melancholy. maybe i should stop thinking about things that are literally impossible to occur now. i made good and skipped cs2200 today. fuck you, ethan. my tumblr needs a new url. i need to be a star-kid too. i actually have a lot to say about what i felt while watching 'the perks of being a wallflower', but i'm afraid most of it is rather silly. so i'll just keep that locked up in my sick head.</div><div><br/></div><div>i just posted a thing. on facebook. why? do i do this to myself?</div><div><br/></div><div>and i'm out. of things to say.</div><div><br/></div><div>poo-tee-weet?</div><div><br/></div><div>burnout</div><div><br/></div><div>it's frustrating because i want to say more. when i return to my room tonight i'll just have ACF to say what happened about. in what areas can i improve there? there isn't even anything TO improve. anjaly just laughed shrugging-offingly when i said ACF is to date the only organization i attend. and i'm not even a part of it. i already know i'm going to regret so much when i leave this place. i might hate ACF, but that has always been my one and only straw. might as well remember the only thing i had. visions arrive too late. i'm too scared to do anything new. to even find out anything new to do.</div><div><br/></div><div>:gap:</div><div><br/></div><div>i often prepare things to say before i attend a social setting, aka every friday evening. such as:</div><div><br/></div><div>i'm going to have a deathly weekend. i have a big cs hw that i've put off until now, and i've just barely started it, and i was thinking of asking a friend for help, but i'm not getting the feeling that he'd want to be of any, or that he will be of any. it's not like he's going to go out of his way to help me. and i feel like i wouldn't enjoy working with him anyway.</div><div><br/></div><div>(i told sam that i have this weekend left to figure out assembly code, and he just laughed at my impending, dooming stress that's squeezing me very hard now. i don't want his help, either. and i don't think he would be of any.)</div><div><br/></div><div>about how i watched 'the perks of being a wallflower' last night, and its strange nostalgia evocations.</div><div><br/></div><div>and how i just, desperately, hope that everything will be o.k. (but i know i will shove away anyone who tells me so.)</div><div><br/></div><div>then i'm constantly met with questions like &quot;are you going to eat&quot; or &quot;are you coming to center street&quot;, maybe, or other ones whose answers are so fervently insignificant that i want to tell whoever asked them to fuck off. which would be a big deal, for them. once at least 3 people asked me that, and 3 doesn't seem like a lot of people, but it is when they ask the same question and when the question is stupid. i was actually surprised that that was all they had to say to me. but i'm not surprised, anymore, now.</div><div><br/></div><div>i'm thinking about sitting at a table me, being all sad. and i'll feel the intense stares, that say to each other, look, what an idiot, look what he's doing to himself. how silly.</div><div><br/></div><div>how my perspective of things is becoming increasingly flawed.</div><div><br/></div><div>i just wished ilana porter a happy birthday.</div><div><br/></div><div>:gap:</div><div><br/></div><div>and she hasn't acknowledged</div><div><br/></div><div>ANYWAY</div><div><br/></div><div>whatever enoch talked about today was heavily metaphorical, more difficult to understand, and thus easier to ignore. vince was standing up front with the worship team, his arms limply hanging at his sides and his eyes closed, making him look stupid. i just concentrated on that. i paid enoch and picked up my ACF t-shirt. now i have one more thing to remember it by. david informed me that justin is gay.</div><div><br/></div><div>dinner was at five guys, and louisa's car was full of awkward people: me, jennifer, helen, louisa herself, and a fat boy named david m. i kept trying to initiate short bursts of talk only with jennifer by making eye contact. i don't remember anything we might have talked about. she has crooked teeth. when david sat down in the seat next to her that i had just gotten up from, she said to him that i was sitting there. several people appeared to know david from high school, but i only saw helen make any attempt to converse with him. he played games on his phone alone while waiting for his food. i ate 2 burgers and jack and takuto said i was &quot;beast.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>lousia drove us, minus david m., plus jared, to chris' house, where she let his dog outside to pee so he won't end up peeing in the kitchen. his dog is named frisbee. she fed him carrots. i didn't want to touch him. no one really tried to pet him.</div><div><br/></div><div>at the center street activity room, i wasn't interested in catchphrase, mafia, or settlers of catan, so i kept standing up and rocking on my feet in the middle of the room. looked at jennifer, who stuck with yan and christina. she doesn't talk a lot, either. blair visited. he tried to high-five me. we didn't say anything to each other, but he talked with sam about his relationship with cathy, and i got up and walked away. i didn't get to talk to monique almost at all, maybe because she was preoccupied with her ukelele, which is pretty. i stayed with them for the rest of the night, because i'd have nothing to do if i went to my room alone. i thought about asking monique for my steam password, even though i didn't want it back. i sat at a table with her, steph, sam, and justin, who i don't dislike anymore.</div><div><br/></div><div>i felt a lot better by the end of the night, even though i think i shouldn't. it was an okay escape, and steph will be celebrating her birthday when morning comes, and i'll be having my deathly weekend figuring out homework without the 3 people who are my only potential sources of help, but..so it goes. this..weight..it is steadily becoming unbearable.</div><div><br/></div><div>:</div><div><br/></div><div>i'll, i'm afraid, be sticking with them after all. in the end, i love them.</div><div><br/></div><div>i friended justin and jared.</div><div><br/></div><div>sam can't help me on this assignment. i can't believe i tried getting him to sympathize. saying &quot;i don't know how i'm going to manage.&quot; neither will he. besides, he'll be out with steph tomorrow. what was i thinking.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 1-30 wed</div><div><br/></div><div>one, two, three, four, five days. i can't listen to 'nantes' or 'tunnels' anymore. they had been my favorite songs for the past week or two, but a couple days ago they lost all of their meaning. why hasn't my ass flattened out from me sitting on it for so many hours? i feel like literally doing nothing. i think about going to a small group and voicing it out. how i have lost my drive. how i don't feel like doing a single thing. i always feel a little bit tired (i wish i was more tired). i always feel lonely, because i want to. talking with david is always unfulfilling. strange, how it had only felt un-unfulfilling when we would cynically look down upon the world. nobody notices you when you ignore them. i can tell i'm not doing well when rammstein music begins to resonate within me again. facebook is so fucking stupid. i saw some interesting people today and yesterday. they are, not in order, hayson, kush, chip, sarthak, anjaly, cecili. i ignored 4 of them, and several more. i don't do much talking these days. i ignore a lot. i don't get micro-moments of love anymore. whenever monique posts something to her tumblr, it's always about god or something stupid like that, and i don't want to read it.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>

<div><br/></div>
<div>three and a half months. got to get back into my writing habit again. it's healthy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we saw krista. nothing was different; we still walked in silence and split up unceremoniously in the classroom. jerry lin still sits with me, he remains by my side. i am pretty sure allison was sighted as well, but in any case no contact was made.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lousia was at crc access control again when i went to work. she thought a 3-hour shift is long. i don't think so after that 7-hour one last week. kwiley complimented my scanning pattern. heh heh. &quot;scanning pattern,&quot; he said. scanning pattern. he's a nice guy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and the day was the first small group meeting of the semester. &quot;steve&quot; had graduated so he wasn't here, allison was, along with monique, and with sort-of-newcomers laurie and vince. i described personal &quot;growth&quot; as &quot;becoming comfortable with what you can't change and working to change what you can&quot; and a couple people thought i was quoting slaughterhouse-five but i recalled no such quote from the book. i also thought and decided that a way i have grown since coming to tech is that i no longer seek approval from others. during the actual bible passage discussion, i didn't have much to say, about observation, observations about repetition and crap, i mainly focused on the last three words &quot;love each other.&quot; when asked what i thought the phrase &quot;remain in me&quot; (spoken by jesus) meant, i suggested to replace the word &quot;remain&quot; with &quot;believe&quot; and although that altered the nature of the meaning slightly it still captured a sufficient amount.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>everybody always seems a little overly eager to take off after the meeting officially ends, i think. allison and laurie left just about immediately. i always prefer to linger, as long as i perceive monique to mind my presence. vince is now the second leader so he stayed too, and we talked about our futures and monique comforted him about finding work experience and i stayed quiet for most of their discussions. they said that i'm not that shy, but only relatively, compared to other people, freshman, who are apparently extremely shy. i was a little surprised and not being perceived as outright shy. monique called me flat-out funny, and i think that's the best compliment i ever receive, that i'm funny. isn't everybody supposed to be funny though? that's the basis of being likable.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i talked with monique until nearly midnight, and although my voice fell flat again and stayed flat, i felt okay. one other thing she said is that she enjoys my company. yes, she's special to me after all. the conversation strayed to lesser topics such as video games, but we also talked about paranoia agent and her boy. i don't think she's going after him anymore, nor him her. i don't know exactly what happened. perhaps the spark just flamed out. perhaps i, monique, and jessie all hold similar views on romance. bystander views. why can't we just say what we want to say, we asked. why does it have to be a game, a game like chess, with so much unnecessary strategy and mind-gaming involved. i said we should all just be recklessly straightforward.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so i was social yesterday, with who i now think is my best friend here.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today krista was sighted once more, and she reported to have come in close proximity to the man quincy. it was dull. krista is a rather awkward person, but i don't know for sure if she's like only around me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>dan used the <em><strong>_ </strong></em><strong>_</strong>. but nothing happened.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>let's talk some more about mo, she's also claiming to have become more distant from god the heavenly father after whatever horrors she witnessed in india. i thought about &quot;handlebars&quot; and the unimaginable bad things that happened, are happening, and will happen there, all of which she witnessed, all of which god knows, and how i'm just sitting in this room by myself enjoying all that i can, riding my bike with no handlebars, if you will, while the earth develops more scars by the minute.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i have to yet to pray for people who form the group that is monique's (and vince's) small group of 2013-14. what would i say? i will need to pretend, since i don't believe, that jesus is a good friend of mine and communicate to him the good things i want for my friends. wait, what?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i picked up my shit at the post office while the ACF proxe station was going on and the following people were present: vince, mo, steph, ritche, clement, and the guy i don't know well young. i heard steph say hi to me but every time i looked at her she wasn't or wouldn't look at me. &quot;hi i'm stephanie, do you have a minute?&quot; i heard her say three times. ritchie explained some gospel stuff to me, while i wasn't paying attention. i think it was the same story i had heard mike explain some time last year. last year, while i was unusually delusional. they had a board with a bunch of adjectives written on it, on which people placed a sticky note near the one they most strongly perceived christians as. i put mine under &quot;loving&quot; because, i explained, it's what was shown to me during my 3.5-year ACF run. clement smiled his dumb smile at me and i just grinned back, bored. ritchie remembered that i wasn't at ACF last friday. how?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so yesterday vince promised (not formally) that he'd let me know about whatever stuff he's going to do over the weekend and i might accompany him. he and mo have plans to meet with various people and i don't.</div>

<div>the guard rochelle is really cute.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/></div>
<div>jan 22 w</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>here we go. a solid week after day one.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>what happened six days ago:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>what i said about wearing suits. i hate them because they are costumes. whenever i put one on, i am dressing up as someone i am not, someone i do not wish to be. and then i have to act the part too.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i saw rochelle on that bus and both of us were afraid to look at each other, maybe. i was afraid to look at her. i safely glanced in her direction when she wasn't looking at me. i thought about her smile a few times. jeez.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>music-induced nostalgia is overwhelming. i don't imagine this to be a unique way of listening to music. but i don't pay attention to songs' lyrics, only the mood it puts me in and the time and place in my life that it puts me back in. &quot;my beautiful dark twisted fantasy&quot; is my cluelessness that pervades my first year. &quot;let loose the horses&quot; is when i discovered tumblr and thought i was in a place in which i truly belonged. &quot;far&quot; is when i broke away. &quot;funeral&quot; and &quot;begin to hope&quot; and &quot;up from below&quot; represent my naiveté in during year three. so far, &quot;the listening&quot; and &quot;pure heroine&quot; will bring this era to a close. this is most of the reason why i can't make many mixtapes. the songs mean too much too specifically to me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i don't talk much to the other guards there, but nadia one day was talking about this semester being a bunch of guards' last. kwiley and several others would be leaving after this semester. what legacies lay hidden in the pool for them? i wonder who i'll miss most. i think it'll be kwiley, no one else is quite as friendly to me. i'm suddenly seeing ashley everywhere though. i initially thought she looked like rachel, sean's girlfriend. now there is no resemblance. how badly will i miss the pool? the pandora radio? the guard office? the leisure pool? anything?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>speaking of the pool, sidney sherrill (i'm sure it was her) suddenly showed up one day. she was at the water fountain when we made eye contact and she smiled at me. zero words were exchanged. what a shame. i can easily see her in a lifeguard swimsuit. but i can't remember anything remotely about any prior experience of hers as one.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on the 16th, three asian guys, at least one of whom was korean (probably all three) approached me and asked if i knew who jesus was. as i was like oh boy, here we go again. i overheard them talking to two girls as i first walked into the CULC that day. &quot;busy with schoolwork?&quot; one of them had asked. i don't think they were doing it right, evangelizing, that is, although i decided to listen to them a bit, listen to the stuff i have heard so many times, come from the mouth of someone else. i decided that had i not already been exposed to the material, i would never believe something like that coming from them. i said things like &quot;i know how this story goes,&quot; referring to jesus and what happened to him and who he was. i told them i have a bible, which isn't entirely accurate because i don't, and they encouraged me to read mine, specifically the four gospel books. i will do no such thing in the foreseeable future. i just wanted to exercise and be agreeable.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>some time before this wesley's girlfriend, or whoever she is, greeted me enthusiastically at the door and said to me that every day should have some excitement, or else every day is boring. she's right, you know. that's all i have to say about this. simple.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I have two peculiar fantasies, one where I leave Allison outside, naked, in freezing weather to freeze to death, and another in which I save Katherina from drowning. katherina reminds me a tiny bit of Lorde, which she really shouldn't. she's just attractive is all. the depth is shallow.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at the tutoring orientation, i was more than a little shocked to see mary-ann present there. unfortunately, there was no communication established, just as none was expected. i find her face and body kind of weird, in a unique-to-her way. sometimes she doesn't seem like a real person.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>rahul was there as well, and of course we don't care that no contact was made with him.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>marie and i had a non-unpleasant and quite brief conversation on the trolley. i spied her again today too. i like her laugh, i really do. just another thing to miss from the city.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now last friday from ACF, i learned that emily has &quot;no close friends,&quot; she said so herself. i told her that i liked her hair. twice, because i don'think she heard me the first time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i know mo doesn't become a different person when out of small group, and i'm not getting upset at it anymore.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>that freshman guy sat by himself at sweet hut on friday night. reminds me of me, again. a bad trait. i glanced at him several times and moved away from him to sit closer to christina and yan. neither of whom are dire.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now today, i do believe my co-guard was the sarah stone. we couldn't talk, or rather i couldn't talk. she's one of the quieter guards too, unlike the more talkative one whom i worked with on sunday. she just asked me &quot;how are you?&quot; this morning before 5:30 and all i said was alright, i think. and that was the end of it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so since i was so tired in the early afternoon, i sat the CULC and listened deeply to third and second sortie music for over an hour. it was blissful. there's nothing noteworthy about my hour-long tutoring session. that's not important.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the mock interview. i had some positive interaction with the lady who interviewed me. i think she found out a lot more about me through this than she would have through an &quot;actual&quot; interview. she said that i seemed genuine, which i would wholeheartedly agree with were it not for the fact that i was in my suit. she was also impressed with my lifeguard duties and the fact that i have been up since 4 am today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and this is all i have to say for today.<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
jan 23 r</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the hour continues to draw late. we must get our mind back into place.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>social angst is now being felt with a new party. while i may have learned to deal with it in one setting, a different environment with different people brings it all on again, and this time the remedy is nigh unreachable. to obtain that we'll need to break our toughest shell yet.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>what have we learned from god? to ignore, to filter, to dismiss the unnecessary feelings. but it wasn't the feelings we targeted, it was, once again, the people. those people can no longer hurt us, but others can and will unless we do something about it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>there must be a rift in the scheduling process that is resulting in my being paired with katie all the damn time. she has the slightest hint of lorde (the artist) because of her curly hair. she has big glasses and is good-looking. she gives me weird looks and i can't tell if she's making fun of me (and not just because of the &quot;kiss&quot; incident). today she told me to put the covers back on the diving blocks and stared at me for a moment with an odd, uncomfortable smile, as if unsure of whether or not i understood what she had just said.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>maggie was there again today too and she must have just gotten promoted or something. not my business. she seems like a very honest person (girl), soft. does not talk much, but still significantly more than i do. she asked me how my semester is going, and i tried to sound easygoing. we talked for a little about our study abroad experiences. funny that i basically expected her to already have her own. and she didn't disappoint. she had plenty to talk about. at the end of my shift i helped her move the lane lines back after kayaking left, with one side objective and that was to earn a mention in the &quot;kudos&quot; section of her shift supervisor notes she was taking. she had already mentioned katie twice. i knew i wouldn't look in their specifically to see if i made it, but i did see her writing something down before i left, though it could have simply been some more stuff about the medical incident.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i don't think about ACF anymore. i have little memorabilia left to take me back one year or two. right now, some of joe hisaishi's pieces make me think of year two and its movie nights spent in david's room, where the first infamous flower blossomed secretly without my knowledge. a handful of piano keys are all that is left to harken back to when the connections were strong and perfection was thought to be manufacturable. i fear for the present, for when it shall become the past in the future.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>monique now wants to watch me play amnesia, what's up with that? i'm going to ask if i can run over to her place instead of having her make her way here. because this place stinks. maybe this will be like the time we watched 'beginners' together, or maybe it'll just be like that really weird time when melissa came over and watched me play dead space 2.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so the guy who looks like a &quot;surfer dude&quot; is almost 24. i did not know that he was that old (&quot;old&quot;). several songs appeared on the pandora radio station and he sporadically sang along with them. i do not know what to make of this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i briefly guarded the incoming lifeguard class of i-counted-thirteen when i started today's shift. several of them were not swimmers. i don't often get to be in this position. i can't remember feeling it in the presence of freshmen at any ACF-related activity, and i certainly won't get it through this new tutoring shit i've gotten myself into. i still need self-reminding that this overture is a hideous kind of pride.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>going back to what i said earlier: social angst is now being felt with a new party. while i may have learned to deal with it in one setting, a different environment with different people brings it all on again, and this time the remedy is nigh unreachable. to obtain that we'll need to break our toughest shell yet. today, i couldn't interject. whenever i attempted to, i did so with a weak beam of light that the noise immediately swallowed. so i sat and wallowed. trying to not wallow just makes it worse. this is a very undesirable feeling and needs to be treated as soon as possible. but how the fuck has everybody else already figured it out? what about all the people who've never had the need to figure it out?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>

jan 24 f</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today, no events transpired until nearly 7 pm, which is when i arrived at the student center. there were &quot;discussion groups&quot; happening so i made my way to monique's, where we talked about &quot;friendship.&quot; the people present were: myself, monique, nick, vince, jonathan (the one from nj), and some newcomer named jennifer. i realized that this was the first moment today that i spoke, or made any sound with my vocal chords at all (almost).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>some questions proposed were what makes a friendship good, how have you ever been hurt by a friend, what does it take to make a good friendship, and i think something like what have you learned from your friendships. i answered that last one with &quot;a certain kind of acceptance&quot; while thinking about v. basically the only friends i could consider when thinking of my answers were v, tom, and pasta. ACF friends were barred. the answers for what makes a friendship good tended toward honesty and sincerity. i couldn't think of a time when i was hurt by a friend, aside from the moment pasta announced her first boyfriend, and that doesn't count for several reasons. a couple of the others cited timelines that reached as far back as middle and elementary school, and i couldn't understand how they were even able to draw from experiences that occurred then.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>jonathan, the kid from new jersey, and nick gave in my opinion the least sincere answers. jennifer hardly said anything, gave some succinct, one-word answers but never elaborated. vince tried, and mo told her stories. i?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>one of the things monique said that went to heart was of her realization that a friendship requires effort to maintain. and i introspected, and wondered how much effort i've put into mine. how many times have i reached out to somebody i wanted to be with? have i ever been needed? have i ever been relied upon? was i ever aware, or was i never even considered?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>blair, hyo jae, and diana appeared on site and i didn't say anything to them, i didn't even call out their names, i just hugged them and asked diana &quot;how've you been?&quot; (i gave her a really sloppy hug). i was happy to see them, but the magic evaporated rapidly. it merely flashed like lightning. blair dropped a piece of advice that i have known for a while, but have yet to realize. it is that once the train has left the station, igniting new friendships will become extraordinarily difficult. that is why i will need to make all that i can out of the people i can still orbit (mine have been decaying for months).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it was the first time i have both christina and diana simultaneously in my field of view.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i walked with steph on the way to center street and we had our first discussion in a very long time, that touched on a variety of topics including the fact that i only have one class, that i dress the same in 6-degree weather as i do in warmer weather, and her thermos.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>clement informed that he too enjoys my company. that got me thinking about the exact vibe i exude from my body, apparently i seem very content and usually, though not necessarily, happy, because i stay quiet and smile a lot. this is news. i do not know if it is true. he also asked if i will be going to emerge. i had no plans to when he asked, but then i went on my phone and loaded the place on the maps app and recognized the six train cars and the little picnic-y area where i had sat and discussed things with sam and other people and the tremendous ache i felt in my heart as i watched steph walking along the lakeshore with her friend during that quiet time thing. it may be something i want to do again. i have two weeks to reconsider.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>interaction at the activity room was minimal, as per usual. david came by too, and during the movie he kept saying stupid things to me. that's all we have left to do with each other, i suppose. he said he'll try to visit me at the competition pool tomorrow, during my shift.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>steph looked slightly prettier than usual, from afar under the dim light. i wasn't bothered that much.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>monique probably really just simply wants to watch some real time amnesia gameplay. i have to actively stop myself from fantasizing that she wants to spend time exclusively with me. that type of simulation is not to be carried out with her.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
jan 25 s</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday's review neglected to mention a few key moments in jennifer's behavior: one, she called me cute when i was toying with my sweatshirt sleeves, which is easy, and two, while returning to the ULC that night, she kept saying my name over and over in a weird voice. it was quite strange.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>contrast the despair i felt while working on thursday night to the lackluster atmosphere of this morning's shift with mindy. it all depends on the people, once more.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>outside jane stood, as if waiting for me. she was actually waiting for a roommate of hers to finish running, and i ended up keeping her company. it was quite nice. we simply chatted and i confirmed again with her that this is my last semester here. she seemed sad. i should seem sad.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i received another pleasant surprise when helen texted me and asked if i wanted to join vince and the crew for dinner. i had just eaten a big lunch, but i automatically accepted the opportunity to be social and jumped on their wagon. the people present were: myself, helen, vince, the girl charlotte, and the new jersey jonathan. i feel like jonathan has been asking me the same questions repeatedly, concerning graduating. i texted v in the back commenting on how much i hate asian pop music. i talked less. i didn't say a word to charlotte or helen the whole time. vince always just plays his k-pop in the car and takes us to asian restaurants and bakeries. i, not used to korean food and still full, didn't order a dish and just ate shared food and a bowl of plain rice. i felt like i was with a group of big babies, but of course, i am still the biggest baby. i just don't feel like i belong with these people. i don't fit with them. i don't want to fit with them. i don't want to be their friends. jonathan has an awkward gait. i swear these people are lowering my confidence.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>how can i still be surprised that monique has other resources? just because she's an endangered critical source doesn't mean i'll always be needed. we kept our promise on the amnesia thing but monique mentioned that blair was there just before i left my room. i almost sighed, but i like him too after all, don't i, but i still dropped a small hint. i'm upset, but that is solely my problem. i felt stupid playing through the entire game yet again in a 3-hour sitting, but monique claimed to have been entertained the whole time (blair left early). i predicted correctly that i would be feeling the way i did, but i didn't care enough i guess. i wonder how she perceives me. i hate the way i look whenever i stare in the mirror. i'm worried that i wasted the time we spent together today. but what is 3 hours, to the 3 and a half YEARS that have gone since we began revolving? there is no time LEFT TO worry.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>steph's birthday is tomorrow and i smile wryly at myself because this time i'm not invited to whatever birthday dinner is going on that monique and blair talked about in front of me. i wanted to call attention to it while i was with monique and blair, but for all intents and purposes i made no mention. no no no, an invitation like this cannot be requested. my damage has been done, it was inflicted months and months ago, we have begun drifting apart before we've even left each other.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i was certain that the amnesia playthrough i had watched last week is the same one that monique said she had watched and these suspicions were confirmed when she mentioned the youtube channel name. for some fucking reason, i never revealed that to her. i do not know why. it's such insignificant subject matter, and yet i maintained the lie. and for what sake? i will now use this as starter material sufficient for at most one small conversation.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>after i finished the game i just left. i will never do this again.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hmm. i played a L4D2 game with zora again, and we had an okay time of old. nothing can stop time's decay.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>do you know what the song 'eet' means to me? i went back and reread most of the things i wrote while abroad at barcelona. that song means the world to me. <br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
jan 26 n</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>WHY is it SO easy to be so SAD all the time? i am not going to write about anything that makes me feel like this anymore. it will be same as all the other things in this vein that i've already written for the past two years. i am just going to ignore everything that makes me feel this way and see where that gets me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>that said, i seem to have created this whirlwind for myself that drained all the positivity i built up on saturday. i am picking up drastically lower levels of friendliness and interest in talking to me in my communications with monique, maybe, hopefully, i am merely reading too hard and am being paranoid. i didn't go to this week's small group meeting, but i have confirmed an alternate route, which is louisa's thursday group. she used a lot of exclamation marks.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>write about how i hated the crowd in the lifeguard office during the in-service, and how much more i liked the quiet emptiness of the pool during the last hour before it closed. i like leaving. i like being in large spaces by myself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>

jan 31 f</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><span style="-evernote-last-insertion-point:true;"/>disaster.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>no, nothing much has truly happened in a week. it would seem, then, that my chronic &quot;sadness&quot; peaks on weekends, the emptiest of days. i can't remember fall semester. it's gone, kind of like how barcelona is gone. i don't think it ever happened.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the sole reason for the whirlwind last weekend was a specific person's texting behavior, which really shouldn't be able to blow out candles. i want to make monique a mixtape, but i don't have the right songs. all of them are too important only to me. the notions would be impossible to convey to her through a simple collection of them.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>because i couldn't go to the normal monday small group, i went to louisa's on thursday instead. it was larger, and monique was present there too even though she leads the monday one...i don't know if she sits in on louisa's every week. it took a LONG time, or so it felt. i was restless and didn't really want to listen. i didn't feel like trying to hear anything, as if trying had worked during all of year two. i didn't have much to share, and when prompted once i flat out shrugged, indicating a final indifference. i had to download the bible app onto my phone again.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on wednesday i entered an inescapable situation per sam's suggestion: i visited steph basically only to ask her for food because the snow had shut the city down and i had little to eat in my room. she fed me taquitos and i ate them while sitting on her couch watching her netflix show with her, that i had zero interest in. she offered me a bunch of other food. for several distinct reasons, i felt VERY uncomfortable with the idea of taking from her. prominent ones being that we are merely acquainted now, and i am doomed to go only backwards from here, and also that this made me feel like a sore loser. i haven't even graduated from this yet.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>before that, i worked a boring shift at the pool during which i tried to failed to keep myself from staring at rachel s. there were two new guards there, and the other two guards who weren't the new ones seemed to me to be overeager to display their seniority. of course, i could always be wrong, but whether i was or not, i could feel my judgement clouding my vision. then there was felipe (hopefully spelled correctly) who sat in the guard office knitting because he was bored at home and that was literally the only reason he had driven all the way back here. i don't believe he is a fake person, but much of his behavior seems artificial to me. how do i avoid his situation?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today, the recruiter from the company epic was at the stupid career fair and recognized me, calling me by name. i didn't call her by her name, even though i hadn't forgotten it (i hope). before i left the damn place, i said it was nice seeing you again one more time, and it didn't go smoothly on my end. her voice is so earnest. how do i achieve this?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>everybody has friends. don't be fooled into thinking otherwise.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today, the ACF group was once again fairly small. i recognized every person in the room. i arrived 45 minutes late. i don't like listening to clement nearly as much as i liked listening to enoch. i paid almost no attention to the study of the passage about jonah. however i should have shared something, when we were passing around the topic of fear and what we are afraid of when considering this golden path. the other nj kid also didn't share anything, and that made me like him less. thus, (points to self).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i didn't have a good social night. i still try too hard. i don't think i'm such a funny person after all. the crowd that came out to dinner was pretty small too, so i didn't feel overwhelmed by social air pressure (i become enormously stressed when levels are even slightly above bare minimum). but i still said very little substance to steph, christina, and ritchie. i couldn't sit still again. i didn't want to be in tam's car.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>some people are just luckier than others.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>even though the subject of dating was up for discussion at the dinner table for a good while, the only thing i said that seemed to interest anyone is that i have a middle name.  <br/></div>

However when Nadia was present, the channel between them two only remained open.</div><div><br /></div><div>I wore Monique's scarf; again, and thanked her for it.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><hr /><div>
1-8 w</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Today was the beginning of an end.</div><div><br /></div><div>One (1) stranger interaction. It occurred in the CoC advisor waiting area. The stranger claimed to be a second-year student who classified as a senior because he was that good at school. I thought he was hhumblebragging but reversed my judgment in time for him to compliment my scarf. (Monique's) It took me a full five seconds to say thank you.</div><div><br /></div><div>In the big CS class with the packed lecture hall, I just happened to wander into the row that just happened to have two seats next to Jerry Lin.

I ate my banana as she ate her banana. This is all very embarrassing.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><hr /><div>
1-10 f</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Today there was extended conversation with our newest, Maggie J. There were times when she had nothing to say to me. I told her about ACF and she said a Henry invited her to it, but I didn't recognize the last name.

<div>
<div>so this is the new year and i don't feel any different. i don't mean to be cynical, after all i was happy to celebrate simply with the family. we watched the times square ball drop on tv. i was happy that taylor swift was there because for some reason, last week at the hot pot restaurant, 'shake it off' appeared on the radio and it made me kind of happy. kept thinking about how quiet it was here while a million people were having the moment of the year in the city new york. a man proposed to his girlfriend on live tv and she said yes. other than my brother and parents i was accompanied only by ROdNEY, who found nothing worth celebrating. he kept asking what great things happened in 2014 and what great things there will be to look forward to in 2015 (USA will end all wars?) and called new year's a christian holiday because it's based the gregorian/christian calendar. i texted three people happy new year. Zora replied, &quot;U too&quot;, tom replied &quot;Happy new year!&quot;, and v didn't reply.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i wonder how tom spent his countdown. part of me wants him to be worse off than me and part of me knows that to want such is wrong. does any part of me want him to be happy?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>there's no reason to be a grinch about the new year but also no reason to treat it as anything special that needs to be grabbed. i think that's what has changed this time around, some sort of acceptance versus lament. it's a slightly better flavor of apathy, which was still the reigning &quot;emotion&quot; crowning this december. i only made slight efforts to put on christmas music while alone in my apartment. i fell asleep to it maybe no more than two times. there was no anticipation or lead-up to the final holidays and day. no last times doing x of the year nor first times of the new year.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we went to eat dim sum today at crown palace, where we haven't been to in years i thought because it sucked. i don't think it's changed much. it was quite crowded which was a surprise and some of the ladies at the front desk couldn't speak chinese, i think. i don't know why else my dad would switch from english to chinese. the same thing occurred at the hot pot restaurant. that's all i have to say about that.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this morning was sort of exciting because i'd get to wake up and walk out of my room into a brightly-lit house after the new year night. i downloaded '1989' and synced it to my phone and then disassembled my computer. i never bound any new music to my post-lights/truslow stage and it wasn't filled with any holiday music either. i think the only song i can use to revisit it is courtnee draper's cover of 'you belong to me'. now '1989' will be the catalyst for whatever is coming next. good or bad, i honestly don't know anymore. i'm becoming afraid of anticipating anything good happening. it never does. i suppose that's the problem right there.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a big mistake i made this winter break is bringing almost my entire computer setup back home with me, basically only because i wanted to use a high refresh rate monitor again. it's simple to think about how easily survivable it would have been without it, but i was rarely in the present moment. for all that ROdNEY is, even he pointed that out. pretty sure i can have no stronger indicator than that. and tomorrow i'm already scheduled to leave. it hasn't hit me yet how rarely i will be seeing my family from now on. when i'm at work all i can think about is that nobody gives a fuck about me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>dividing new year's resolutions into habits and goals. january 1 may not be a reason to start, but it's certainly no reason not to start.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>resume dream journal</div>
<div>the mini-workout i used to do, now with a workout bar</div>
<div>begin with one yoga position</div>
<div>rigid stretching regimen</div>
<div>and meditate for three minutes</div>
<div>kegel exercises</div>
<div>watch more movies. in theatres. one a week if possible?</div>
<div>brush teeth BEFORE showering</div>
<div>GO OUTSIDE every time i feel like masturbating</div>
<div>continue playing my flute</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>begin looking for a new apartment</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>take one coursera course</div>
<div>read the books i brought back</div>
</div>
<div>and a vague one is to cook more</div>
<div>easy-to-say one is to learn to dance</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/></div>
<div>1-4 n</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<div>i saw the hobbit 3 three days ago. my brother really didn't want to but angrily agreed to watch it with me and mom and dad. i see my emotional inability manifest in odd places like this; a girl next to me kept gasping and exclaiming out loud as characters died and i asked myself stupid questions like, why can't i do that? i later found out that he had never seen the first two hobbit movies. mom and dad really wanted to see a movie as a family together, something we haven't done in a very long time (the last time they were at the freehold loew's, it hadn't been renovated yet). i agreed mostly because i felt like i owed it myself to agree to a family activity, after almost two weeks of being home during which i mostly wanted to do nothing and go nowhere. not even shopping. we never went to new york for a second time and we didn't go skiing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>they all accompanied me for half the trip back down, until richmond. dad booked the hotel for us and i specifically asked  him to select the same one i stayed at on my way up, just because there was a chipotle nearby but it was closed when we got there and would open too late the next morning. i had to leave early because i would have at least eight hours of driving on the second day. it was weird seeing the camry in the hotel parking lot again, exactly where it had been two weeks ago. reminded me of the pointlessness of everything.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>somehow i didn't feel like a grown-up as i climbed into the new car (the camaro) and drove off, before my parents, who would be heading in the opposite direction anyway. it had rained and the ground was wet and the air was cool. i hate nearly everything about this car. it feels so thick. the hood is long, the windshield is tiny, the a-pillars are thick, the doors are thick, the windows are tiny. (coincidentally) i stopped at one of the same rest areas that i had stopped at with my mom on my first trip down. the xm station that had been playing holiday music had stopped playing holiday music. i listened to '1989' and felt kind of sad. i find most of all of my old music, all that i organize by association, exhausting now, and drove a good portion of the remainder in silence (not really, because the road noise was really loud). my butt was tired of being sat on for so long and i became very restless. it kept raining. i felt a lot of anxiety as i neared the stretch of I-85 that leads into atlanta, and when i did get there i felt sick. i didn't want to be back here. my subconscious  knows what i'm returning to. i'm pretty sure someone tried to race me on the highway. driving the camaro into the parking garage felt awful. nothing felt in its right place anymore. nothing ever was. i knew i wouldn't be happy driving this car, but i underestimated it again.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>no one broke into my apartment while i was gone. i had left a lot of space clear before i went home, and when i opened the front door i kind of felt the way i did when i first moved in. i'm not entirely sure i'm still capable of feeling homesick, but at least there's a part of me that misses my family. particularly my mom. i tell that part that it'll be okay as long as they're all doing okay and are happy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night i tried to take a video of myself masturbating and it went terribly. it's something i've tried a few times before, but i never do anything with the video except delete it immediately. just another way i'm not in tune with myself. i felt a huge, immense dissatisfaction when i finished, to a degree i had never felt before after thinking about sex and relationships and all that i have never experienced.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm operating more and more heavily on autopilot. i never feel anything anymore. i never cry about anything.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i've been meaning to say this for a while, but i need youtube videos to provide background noise for me now when i'm in my apartment alone (which is a lot of time). i frequently toggle between video game let's plays, movie reviews, and ASMR videos (which sadly never trigger for me). it's different from music. videos like these, with people talking into the camera and mic, make it easier to pretend that there's someone here with me.</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/></div>
<div>1-5 m</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<div>tom had told me that he occasionally plays dungeons and dragons with some of his coworkers. as i lay in bed at the hotel the other night i randomly thought about amber, because she's the person at the office who i feel the most distant from, arguably. i came to the realization that my entire current life situation has been engineered by me. i don't have to feel the way i do towards her if i don't want to. i insist on playing the victim of some invisible circumstance. in actuality there is nothing else there to blame. no scapegoat at all. so i am my worst enemy after all.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>things that should be 100% obtainable seem to be the complete opposite for me. i keep having these little episodes at work that can only be small instances of anxiety attacks. it's actually there that i am most alone with my thoughts. throwing away all these opportunities to &quot;network&quot; and &quot;make connections&quot;. i go into stasis there, it's the only way to pass the eight hours spent each day going nowhere while still retaining some semblance of sanity. i'm going to become very, very sick.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i recognize that my apathy is just taking over me in all directions. i don't listen to any music, new or old, i don't watch any movies or tv shows, i play very few video games despite having spent thousands of dollars on a mildly insane computer. i don't exercise. i haven't been keeping up with my &quot;hobbies&quot;. i don't dream anymore. i don't even get horny anymore (i think. beginning). foolishly pushing away the last of my friends! am i depressed yet? the articles on thought catalog about love and sex are making me sick (i need to stop reading those). i constantly tell myself that i am the only one with the power to change myself and i'm too lazy to use it. i really have no excuse. i'm not sure any of my emotions are valid. sometimes i begin to worry that i'll become suicidal. is that weird? to worry about feeling suicidal, without actually feeling suicidal? if i don't MAKE something happen soon, that could be where i'm headed. i don't know which fork is easier to imagine.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>every time i say something to harry i get a little bit angry. like i'm wasting my time talking to him because &quot;nothing will become of it.&quot; it's completely illogical. i'm so savagely sabotaging myself in ways i haven't fully realized yet. i'm so scared of what i'm doing to me without even knowing it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i hate my new car so much. whenever i climb into it i feel the same way i did all those times when i stuffed myself into a suit to march off to a job interview. extremely uncomfortable and fake. like i'm being suffocated and eaten.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i think i'm slightly sick. my head felt extremely tired all day. i skipped lunch again, meaning i didn't give myself anything to eat for ten hours. the air is dry and it might destroy my hands again. all of my frustration about how where i am and what i'm doing isn't doing anything to help me; i'm going nowhere; i'm wasting my time; nobody cares about me; it's all INVALID because i'm not doing anything about it. i'm very tired ALL the time but i'm not putting EFFORT into CHANGING things. and that takes a lot of effort. there is no god and there is no force in the universe that works for you.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now there is no need to build myself the perfect idol, an impossible waypoint. not only is that unnecessary, impractical, and not even possible, but it's also far simpler and nonintuitively easier to simply erase all attachment and let go of it completely. i think i've done this before. i can do it again. brainwash myself if i have to. all i have to do is tell myself that it's not important. it can burn up and have no impact on my life. EXPENDABLE. step one isn't to build a clean empire, it's to untether myself from it and let it drift off into space. now can you do that for me?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>above all, it's the total lack of ambition and passion that is KILLING me from my core. it's been so forever since i last created ANYTHING. some nights i'm sure i live the most pointless existence of them all. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>break everything down into steps.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>fuck</div>

<en-note><div><b>1-1 f</b></div><div><br/></div><div>just because i&apos;m compelled to write something on the first day of the year:</div><div><br/></div><div>i spent my last full day at home editing foxylemur.wlmp and waiting at lens crafters to get my glasses frame adjusted. it&apos;s my first new frame in years so i wanted it to be perfect. instead i made it increasingly imperfect.</div><div><br/></div><div>it seems all of the plans i have for the future are short term and consist of running away from my responsibilities.</div><div><br/></div><div>feeling down as i have to leave tomorrow morning, and while it&apos;s nice that my family is accompanying me for half the trip, i&apos;m sad that i don&apos;t remember feeling any of the positive things i was so looking forward to this winter season. i was just here and now i&apos;m leaving.</div><div><br/></div><div>i remember almost panicking as i tried to pack everything up to leave atlanta, copying dash cam footage, watching the remaining harry potter movies, downloading movies and shows, editing .wlmp&apos;s, finishing &apos;the last of us&apos; main game, building my brother&apos;s ITX computer.</div><div><br/></div><div>thinking about everything that i need living by myself stresses me out so much. my mother and father always talk about where they&apos;re all going to move after they retire and when my brother finishes school and where i&apos;m going to go. that always reminds me of how impermanent everything is.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>1-2 s</b></div><div><br/></div><div>tomorrow i&apos;ll be back in my abysmal apartment. everything will be over. tomorrow morning will be my only remaining opportunity to enjoy the last moments i have with my parents this break. even though my mother was riding in the car with me for the first half, i kept prioritizing the music i had playing. it was supposed to help me reminisce and think back to my first and second years. the result was that i paid less than ideal attention to both my mother and the music.</div><div><br/></div><div>i haven&apos;t been thinking much about summer/fall 2014. even that is approaching &quot;long ago&quot; now. tomorrow i&apos;ll put the music on and see if the emotion memories have faded any.</div><div><br/></div><div>i need to make list of all the things more important that what i keep prioritizing.</div><div><br/></div><div>a hangout with alice is all that i have to look forward to so far, and based on past experience with everything it&apos;ll just be as underwhelming as things like that have always been.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>1-3 n</b></div><div><br/></div><div>paying too much attention to how i&apos;m feeling means i can&apos;t feel anything. of course it means i&apos;m getting used to it the feelings. the in-between suddenly stops when i reach exit 84 on I-85. and here i am again.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>1-4 m</b></div><div><br/></div><div>just glanced at a few entries from one to two years ago and i&apos;m exactly the same. i&apos;m so scared for my future self. i can no longer look at even a year&apos;s length of time and think that it&apos;s plenty for something to happen. too many have passed where nothing happened.</div><div><br/></div><div>no happy new years at the office today. i hate them all so much but would have to include myself if i want to criticize. gym today as usual. mark and i made jabs about not having done any work all break, but the Christian never said anything about it. not that i heard. i want to go ahead and say that there&apos;s no way to know if he also didn&apos;t work out and is feeling insecure about that, or if he did work out and is feeling superior. his not disclosing anything makes me dislike him. i kind of wanted to bring up the things i saw on the drive home and back but held my tongue again.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>1-6 w</b></div><div><br/></div><div>i am bonding with some awful, awful things right now.</div><div><br/></div><div>i know alice&apos;s remarks (&quot;i love you&quot;) were casual, but i don&apos;t think anyone will ever know what those mean to me or how they make me feel.</div><div><br/></div><div>made arrangements (?) to meet up with mike this weekend. this should be interesting?</div><div><br/></div><div>&lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE has made several comments to me about girls. that cute one at the mall, telling me to get women&apos;s phone numbers after i told him i was at a party. i wonder what means.</div><div><br/></div><div>my voice just doesn&apos;t work. i fantasize so much now about everything and begin panicking when i remember how unprepared i really am. and then i try to bury the reality again and again. the 11 o&apos;clock meeting at work every morning makes me particularly aware.</div><div><br/></div><div>krish must think i was and am such a waste of time.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>1-9 s</b></div><div><br/></div><div>mark didn&apos;t work out with us on friday so it was just me and christian again. the tension between the two of us was so heavy, it was tangible. when you put two people like me in the same room...</div><div><br/></div><div>i find that always end up liking more after these one-on-one workouts with him, because he still bothers to tell me when i&apos;m doing an exercise wrong and corrects me and actually offers encouragement. he also mentioned that mark has a bad habit of taking on too much weight and not being able to do enough reps in some sets. something i&apos;ve never heard him say to mark himself. meanwhile mark has also gone against christian sometimes when it&apos;s just the two of us. i&apos;d like to think that i&apos;m inviting, but i just don&apos;t think i&apos;m actually that good.</div><div><br/></div><div>i met up with alice for the third time since last august, and it was actually a lot of fun, i was relaxed the whole time, and it was a super rare chance to satisfy my extroverted side. &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE kept making comments about her being &quot;the one&quot; or my future wife, after i told him i was getting dinner with someone. i can&apos;t remember if i ever said it was with a girl.</div><div><br/></div><div>we went to a chinese restaurant on buford highway and ordered forty pork soup dumplings (xiao long bao). the place was her idea and it was excellent. i tried to focus on keeping my voice not too quiet. while the conversation was consistently punctuated with phone checking, and had large chunks where she was the one talking, it never got awkward and i never had to search for something to say.</div><div><br/></div><div>she told me that tracy, michael&apos;s sister, once had a crush on me, that she&apos;d let slip to alice by accident. this must have been around a decade ago by now. i thought it was hilarious and was also very pleasantly surprised...i&apos;m just barely able to recall the ski trip that this happened on. i thought back to that other ski trip, after the previously mentioned one, during my freshman year of college when tracy and i skied together for a while until after dark and she ended up taking a hard fall during one run. then those couple years of karate together. and every time we saw each other at a gathering since then.</div><div><br/></div><div>after dinner we had to visit the sweet hut like a hundred feet down the street. i was looking around in anticipation; back when i&apos;d come with ACF it seemed like there would be someone at least one of us knew there too, and sure enough i almost immediately see steph AND david AND allison sitting at a table. i said, &quot;oh my god&quot; out loud to myself and had to walk over to them, but i wasn&apos;t thinking anything about how long it&apos;d been since i last saw them, or our previous friendship at all. david asked me if alice was my date, and i was SO stupid and said no, and that our parents know each other. steph said she liked my hoodie (sleeping cat) and later it occurred to me that they had never seen me wearing this hoodie before. she asked me where i got and i said society6 and prepared to explain what it was until allison took over, thankfully. one of them might have asked me how i&apos;ve been. i&apos;m not sure.</div><div><br/></div><div>i ordered a taro milk tea because i didn&apos;t have the energy to decide on anything else. alice and i ended up picking a table near the three of them, but i was basically avoiding them and kept to alice. she took apart my lego keychain and repeatedly attempted to reassemble it. i told her about &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE, the steam friend who i met in person. steph et. al. left soon after, but only allison said good-bye to me.</div><div><br/></div><div>i semi-randomly suggested going to the CULC afterwards, and that&apos;s right where we went. even on a winter break weekend (albeit the last one) the building still wasn&apos;t entirely empty (it just never is, i suppose). i didn&apos;t have much of a reaction entering the starbucks side, nothing like what i felt when i came back for the first time after my graduation. we wandered up to the third and fourth floor, then settled in one of the booths where we kept talking. the topic landed on dreaming and i told her about my dream journals. she became interested and i let her read quite a few entries, skimming them first to make sure they were safe to read. she moved from the opposite side of the table to sit next to me so we wouldn&apos;t have to tilt our heads to read, and ended up leaning against me for a while, legs touching, arms interlocking, etc. i liked the physical contact, but i was so wary of so many things. she asked about some of the people i mentioned in the dream entries. linda is my cousin. david was just at sweet hut, actually. jessie is a girl i used to have a big crush on. i think we liked each other, too, but we were just really stupid. this might have been the trigger that got her talking about jerry&apos;s brother michael shen, and how he awkwardly asked her out one time. and how lisa and my brother had definitely liked each other, too.</div><div><br/></div><div>after that we laid on the benches and talked for a while, i wanting to leave because it was getting late for me but also not entirely willing to end the hangout just yet. we left eventually, i drove her back to her dorm and then left, without a hug sadly. she later texted saying she wished i were there, along with a &quot;luv u.&quot; oh dear.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>1-14 r</b></div><div><br/></div><div>tomorrow is already friday again. and i&apos;ve been back here for as long as i just was at home. counting up the days, just like the summer...</div><div><br/></div><div>just me and chris at the gym for the second day in a row. it was yesterday that he pointed out another flaw in one of mark&apos;s exercises, and i&apos;d like to think that i&apos;m inviting, that i somehow make them feel comfortable disclosing information to me, but i don&apos;t think i am, really.</div><div><br/></div><div>i made just a touch more effort to talk to him today, and one of the things we talked about was how we&apos;re always thinking back to the past and imagining all the things we would do differently if we could have another go. apparently he wasn&apos;t so wise with his money when he was in his 20&apos;s. i don&apos;t know if i am. what will i regret (not) doing now, in five or ten years?</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>1-18 m</b></div><div><br/></div><div>i had lunch with mike yesterday and it should have been cool but i&apos;m numb to these things now. i kept adjusting my shirt and deciding where to put my hands. he did that high five thing that i hesitantly went along with. i don&apos;t know what&apos;s changed and what hasn&apos;t. here are some things: chris yang asked him to be his best man at his wedding. i wonder how little i am to chris yang. i don&apos;t even know what a best man does. little talk about the rest of ACF. he asked about &quot;any girlfriends,&quot; which i dodged too obviously, and if i still go a church, which i said i don&apos;t. he may have kind of invited me to his, just saying i could come if i wanted, and i just ignored that. we took a long time to order our food at la fonda, which i noted i hadn&apos;t been to since the last time i went with ACF. i didn&apos;t see him pray before eating, a habit which lay completely forgotten until that moment. i&apos;m actually a bit surprised he didn&apos;t ask or offer to pray. what happened to that? for a moment i thought maybe mike fallen out of that too, until i stupidly remembered that the reason he couldn&apos;t eat with me last week was because of something his pastor had asked him to do. then there was discussion about workouts at the gym, piano playing, and trying to gauge his social situation. it&apos;s certainly better than mine.</div><div><br/></div><div>the meal ended (i didn&apos;t enjoy the food very much, i never liked la fonda. only agreed to it because jalisco was closed. all i remember about la fonda is sharing paella with monique). before mike left he said something about his pending new job possibly freeing up more of his time, implying that we could hang out again/some more, although i don&apos;t know why.</div><div><br/></div><div>then i went to &quot;scissor hands&quot; to get a haircut.</div><div><br/></div><div>PROSTEAK &lt;DOOGIE&gt; initiates pretty much 100% of all text and steam conversations, often providing personal updates on mundane things that don&apos;t involve me at all. today, after refraining from opening steam until mid-afternoon, he asked if everything was alright. unexpected, but appreciated.</div><div><br/></div><div>turns out he&apos;s not the first steam friend or person i met online to have made notes of (after spending the weekend going through my journal entries from the past year, and coming across stuff i had written about &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (Desi) and &quot;Poppybelle&quot; (Yas)).</div><div><br/></div><div>speaking of, i think my journal/diary entries since mid-2014 are some of the most ridiculous and depressing ones i have read. i&apos;ve never seen so little growth happen, in such a span of time, in anything i&apos;ve written. i&apos;ll read earlier entries and come across things i don&apos;t even remember believing or feeling. but with this, everything has remained exactly the same as it&apos;s been in almost two entire years. some things for far longer than that.</div><div><br/></div><div>i also reread all of the encouragement notes i had received during my time in ACF. it got me thinking about the habits i had then, and my mindset and set of beliefs. generic notes aside, several things stood out. steph calling herself my sister in christ. everybody encouraging me to continue trusting in god using all variations of the phrase. monique writing to me as someone whom she actually seemed to value as a friend. diana expressing admiration for my &quot;honest and sincere&quot; prayers. i didn&apos;t even remember those. the things i thought i believed in and the people i thought i belonged with.</div><div><br/></div><div>there&apos;s no purpose to drinking your own poison.</div><div><br/></div><div>i become extremely sad whenever i&apos;m skyping with my mother. she&apos;s the only person left who cares about me and expresses it, and every time i see that i want to push her away. i become unresponsive and distant, uncaring and nonreciprocal. like i don&apos;t want her to know how sad i actually am every day and don&apos;t want to drag her into this. i&apos;m not sure. i haven&apos;t figured out what it is. it doesn&apos;t help when she (rightfully) becomes upset with me. lack of direction and lack of growth go hand in hand, and i&apos;ve been in a void for months and months. i keep telling myself i need something to remind me of what&apos;s out there, but don&apos;t fully realize that there is nothing to wait for. i already know my future self is going to hate my present, soon-to-be past self. how strange. i already know what i&apos;m going to regret. how on earth is that not enough to fix this? my current existence is hilariously, miserably pointless, and my attempts at completing myself are a comically atrocious waste.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>1-22 f</b></div><div><br/></div><div>it actually snowed tonight. i took some pictures. that&apos;s all.</div><div><br/></div><div>there was a loud group of boys and girls in the apartment hallway as i was walking down it to throw away some trash. and that was more than enough.</div><div><br/></div><div>some people just seem to have an aura of loneliness about them. i sometimes feel it at checkout lines. do i have one? how strong is mine that i give off?</div><div><br/></div><div>today mark gave a half used jar of protein powder as a &quot;present.&quot; christian added that it was to &quot;get me started&quot; [using whey protein]. i guess neither of them ever assumed that i&apos;ve been using protein powder after our workouts already. i know i never explicitly told them; some part of me must have thought that that&apos;s what they thought. i wonder what spurred it though, aside from the most likely possibility that mark just had some sitting around that he didn&apos;t want to finish himself.</div><div><br/></div><div>it was rainy and windy this morning, and as i got out of my car in front of the CRB i saw mindy (from the pool) walk by. if she recognized me she gave no indication whatsoever. if she was a freshman when i was a lifeguard, then she must be a junior now.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>1-26 t</b></div><div><br/></div><div>this morning kyle just turned to me and told me about his going to the gym. it must have been the first time he&apos;s gone in a while. maybe he just wanted to tell somebody about it. i can&apos;t know if he&apos;s lonely or anything, no matter how much I want to think/hope so.</div><div><br/></div><div>valerie&apos;s tiny, squeaky &quot;thanks&quot; when i held a door open for her. these things i&apos;m noting are the same i&apos;ve been for over a year.</div><div><br/></div><div>christian must think i&apos;m an asshole because i&apos;ve never paid for parking once during all these months. he &quot;pinged&quot; me saying he&apos;s going to jalisco today instead of the gym and i just followed. i&apos;m looking to him as a boss, like i can only skip the gym if he does. and when he does skip, i&apos;ll just follow. i wonder how accustomed he is with being thought of as such.</div><div><br/></div><div>reading answers to a question on quora about the &quot;consequences of staying lonely for too long.&quot; they were too real. it was at once so relatable and also frightening to read about the effects of loneliness from other people. to be reminded of what will likely happen to me if i don&apos;t change things soon.`</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>1-27 w</b></div><div><br/></div><div>another side effect of extended loneliness is drastically overlooking virtually every single interaction with another human on the ever-rarer chance that i have one.</div><div><br/></div><div>i was sitting in the office thinking about what alice had said about not being able to imagine getting old. to her, &quot;old&quot; is probably my current age. i remember thinking exactly that way when i was her age. but soon i won&apos;t. distinct, relatively short periods of time that still have unique snapshots now will eventually blur into a single color. like those movie bar code images. everything that i&apos;m able to distinguish now will eventually just morph into &quot;youth.&quot; the end of which is rapidly approaching...</div><div><br/></div><div>that really skittish girl who works in the room with the other students. she kind of looks like the regina who was one of the TAs during my semester at barcelona.</div><div><br/></div><div>my new hoodie arrived, that&apos;s identical to the &quot;cat&quot; hoodie i&apos;ve had but with a &quot;curly dog&quot; instead. both prints from an artist called &apos;rubyetc&apos;, and both white. that might be all i wear to the office for as long as it remains cold enough. i wonder if anyone will notice the difference. the new one is larger and much softer inside. i&apos;ve forgotten how it felt when the &quot;cat&quot; one was new.</div><div><br/></div><div>christian and i tried to go to the gym again but the parking lot filled up right as we got there and he/we gave up immediately. my willpower/dedication to go regardless is failing to perform. instead we had lunch together at chin chin, and it was weird being with him there because it&apos;s not a usual environment. he started talking about his new dietary habits. i found myself saying the same things repeatedly using different words.</div><div><br/></div><div>he spotted a parked camaro and remarked that he liked the car, which surprised me because i remember amber making negative comments regarding it and christian and mark agreeing. i mentioned that i had totaled mine in a week. i imagine there was a little more to the reaction in his head than the reaction that i saw. asking me why i would do such a thing. i began to explain the circumstances of the accident, but he stopped listening and started talking about something else while i was trying to tell the story.</div><div><br/></div><div>&lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE and i have been playing L4D2 alone for these past few days. i currently hold more communication with him than anyone else. and i have to wonder about his perception on this thing, if it&apos;s something he looks forward to after work, which he leaves much later than i leave mine.</div><div><br/></div><div>if he has a girlfriend he would have mentioned her by now.</div><div><br/></div><div>i can&apos;t keep obliging his requests/expectations to game. he just gets angry and i feel like part of the reason i&apos;m taking the game more seriously and also getting angry (sometimes forcing my frustration) is only to emulate him. not because i want to be like him, but just an effort to maintain parallel behavior.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>1-31 n</b></div><div><br/></div><div>some people have this aura of loneliness about them...i have no way of knowing how accurate my sense of this is. i usually detect it in checkout lines. i&apos;ll notice somebody by him/herself and he/she&apos;ll just seem...isolated. it doesn&apos;t happen with every person i see by him/herself. i wonder what it is about them that&apos;s making me notice. the frightening thing about this is that i&apos;m absolutely certain i give off this aura too. i think people can just feel it. today i was seeing it in some guy at target with a backpack on.</div><div><br/></div><div>i often forget that alice isn&apos;t alone. she isn&apos;t like me when i was a freshman, sad and alone. she&apos;s normal and she has friends and has zero need to rely on her relation with someone outside, like me. i was reminded of this when i randomly looked her up on facebook.</div><div><br/></div><div>as much as i&apos;m on board with denouncing various aspects of my typical office job as a computer programmer, when i think about it i know i&apos;ll be even worse off if i weren&apos;t employed in it. there&apos;d be even less direction and stimulation. i actually need this order. but that alone isn&apos;t enough. i should have realized this significantly sooner.</div><div><br/></div><div>christian is in that new open space with colorful carpeting, cubicles, and natural light, while i&apos;m still stuck in the room i&apos;ve been in for the past twelve months. i think i&apos;ll be moved back into an enclosed office with no windows. more despair.</div><div><br/></div><div>i inadvertently ignore my mother all weekend by forgetting to check my phone. she is now (has been) the only person on earth who cares about me. and every time she tries to check up on me i become so sad and don&apos;t want to answer. i&apos;m not crying again yet. some people are just meant to live their lives alone.</div><div><br/></div><div>reading quora people&apos;s answers to the question, &quot;what are some consequences of staying lonely for too long?&quot; was relatable and frightening. seeing other people say the things i&apos;ve been recognizing happening to myself just remind me that it&apos;s all real.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div><b>1-1 n</b></div><div><br/></div><div>time is running out (what else is new) to frolic in the sights and sounds of home this season. this winter they are waking up <a dir="ltr">at noon</a>, the sun setting at 5, rise of the tomb raider, no snow, and the dilapidated christmas tree blinking its miserable lights all hours of the day and night. I&apos;ve been here for two weeks now and this feels timeless. I may as well have always been here. things feel simultaneously recent and eons ago. three days could be three years.</div><div><br/></div><div>I know that before I know it I&apos;ll be be back in atlanta. things will go back to normal and the unknown, and this winter break in the routine will shrink into mystical memory like all the rest. I think I&apos;m doomed to forever spend more time reliving moments than living in them. or that could just be the nature of things. &quot;living in the present&quot; or being aware, making an effort to take it all in; none of it works. making conscious efforts to do so actually takes away from the moment. me and my pathetic attempts to immortalize these moments.</div><div><br/></div><div>things are the devil. the total time spent today going to the mall and back, waiting for the tired cashiers to do whatever the hell processing my returns for four pairs of ultra boost shoes, was at least an hour. they couldn&apos;t do it because paypal, and I left supremely annoyed. both with the stores, and myself. the relics&apos; toxic allure cannot be any clearer. this sour taste is what I need to remember for sure. I wish I could say with more certainty than I can that I&apos;ve hit or am approaching a limit on my retail therapy, but honestly, it&apos;s probably just because I&apos;m home. I never look forward to returning to atlanta, in part because I can&apos;t trust my mind to resist falling back to its poisonous ways.</div><div><br/></div><div>this year once again, on the way towards home, I noticed several other cars all packed full of stuff, their people presumably heading home for the holidays (holidays which are now over). when do they all trickle back?</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>one year should be distant and it feels so but also doesn&apos;t. if it&apos;s so far away how did I get here so fast? by this june, we&apos;ll be finished the one-year-since-one-year transitions, and then two will become three. soon...the numbers will become too high to count.</div><div><br/></div><div>this will never cease to be terrifying.</div><div><br/></div><div>I look at recaps of 2016 and lists of upcoming things in 2017 and just wonder how people can be so cool with a year ending. I&apos;m sure a lot of people aren&apos;t. and I forget to ask myself.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>1-3 t</b></div><div><br/></div><div>I don&apos;t know what it is about my nighttime state of mind and the bottle rocket of thoughts that insomnia brings, but it&apos;s kind of like being drunk. I tend to wake up in the morning, after whenever I finally manage to fall asleep, not remembering how I could think and feel whatever I was thinking and feeling. thoughts of time and depression, building up chemicals in my head with no release.</div><div><br/></div><div>it breaks my heart knowing that my mother is the only person I have left who cares about me. I think I should become acquainted with the fact that she will one day no longer be here with me.<br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><b>1-5 r</b></div><div><br/></div><div>no matter how I spent it, I would be wishing that I better appreciated my last full day at home this year. the game &apos;rise of the tomb raider&apos; utterly dominated this break, and I hope that it&apos;ll make me think of home as I play it again when I&apos;m back down, hunting for the last two achievements. wistfully replay endurance mode and think back to the co-op games with my brother.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m going to be homesick for a short while again. it may be necessary to begin getting acquainted with the idea of no longer having a home and family up here to come back to, which will be the case one day. and is a sort of the thing I cannot imagine happening.</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s currently <a dir="ltr">2 am</a> and snowing, and what I believe is a snow plow truck just drove past my street. I can&apos;t remember my last white christmas, and didn&apos;t get the chance to see snow up here last year (although oddly enough it did snow a bit in atlanta). so I am a bit happy that I got a glimpse this time, even if it&apos;s immediately before leaving.</div><div><br/></div><div>on tuesday, I managed to meet with &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE for the second time, after much persistence from him. I was in the city with family, there to see <a dir="ltr">the phantom of the opera</a> (also the second time for me. I believe the theater is the same one that I went to in 2010). he traveled a little ways uptown and I met him at a starbucks by 36th and 8th. I&apos;ve been wanting a pumpkin spice latte, but had forgotten that they had peppermint mochas. I thought he was going to pay for both of us, but he must have heard me squeak out that I&apos;d buy something from him, because he put up no resistance. it was fine with me.</div><div><br/></div><div>because I was only with him for less than two hours last year, I&apos;d forgotten what he looked like. his appearance wasn&apos;t really expected or unexpected. his face is round and he wore a polo again. has a slight lisp. unexpectedly polite to the people around him, wishing happy new year. this was a thing last time too. it was weird talking about gaming and L4D2 with him in person, especially in such detail and in reference to such a minor incident the night before. we also talked about jobs and living locations. I&apos;m honestly lucky that he&apos;s rather amiable and talkative. it&apos;s what&apos;s saving me from cutting ties with him due to his horrible gaming influence; he actually puts effort into maintaining a bridge to me, which I find strange. he has various friends he kept mentioning.</div><div><br/></div><div>the weird thing that happened was that I offhandedly invited him to dinner with my family, and he said he&apos;d come if they were okay with it, which they were. I was honestly okay with it too, but still didn&apos;t expect him to actually accept. the thought of it being the other way around, me meeting his parents, is terrifying. again his amicability saved this encounter from being some kind of cringey mess.</div><div><br/></div><div>the show was good but I didn&apos;t remember the plot and couldn&apos;t follow some parts, and had to look it up during the intermission.</div><div><br/></div><div>tonight, I dismantled my computer setup that I had going in the study room for nearly three weeks. the monitor was returned to the best buy. I bought my brother a huge bottle of vodka at a nearby liquor store. alice dropped by to give me another, much bigger, bag of stuff to bring down to atlanta for her. she&apos;s so loud and obnoxious, mostly in a good way.</div><div><br/><hr/></div><div><b>1-9 m</b></div><div><br/></div><div>there isn&apos;t really anything to say about being back here anymore vs being at home; the trip down was faster than ever, after parting with my parents at the second hotel, and the transition was less jarring than it has ever been. past the peachoid (which I will no longer be taking photos of), past the rest area by the lake, the featureless highway morphed into that home stretch, which then turned into peachtree, where I make the final left turn. I didn&apos;t feel the same sensation I did when I returned from my break in august. not when pulling into the condo-driveway, not when opening the gate, not when backing into my parking space. unloading the car didn&apos;t take too long. I felt nothing when I unlocked the door to my apartment. nor did I feel anything (but cold) this morning, when I saw bina again, at the gym with christian again, or now in the afternoon.</div><div><br/></div><div>2017 doesn&apos;t feel separate, the way the previous two years&apos; beginnings did. or at least they way I remember them. perhaps my perception of the current will change with time. I suspect at this stage everything has blended together into too much of a blur. there are ever fewer differences than ever between this year and the last.</div><div><br/></div><div>but I think I want there to be, I wanted to begin wearing new shoes and socks, and a new hoodie, something to help separate the phases...but this morning I put on the same clothes and shoes I&apos;ve been wearing for the past few months.</div><div><br/></div><div>the end of 2015 is barely within &quot;one year ago&quot; and won&apos;t be for any longer, as I keep zooming away. I think something ended with that year. it and 2014 feel especially surreal. I keep recalling the time, the distant memories and emotions, and it feels so recent and long ago at the same time (again). 2016 didn&apos;t feel like anything special, but by the end of this year, I&apos;ll probably be recalling it just the same. always whatever came before, while the ones earlier than that keep forever fading until the lines are gone and only vague colors are left.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m already dreaming plans for another standard break this summer. by which time alice will be done with two years of college, and my brother one. this is some whole other kind of relativity, in which I live for the same amount of time as another but perceive it as happening much more quickly. my thoughts and motions too slow and muddled to keep up. little to no changes. I&apos;m weak, and can no longer see myself making any happen.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>christian keeps saying the same things when we&apos;re at the gym. from what we&apos;re going to do with the max weights we find to him constantly and consistently incorrectly remembering what my previous max was.</div><div><br/></div><div>alice disappeared on me tonight. I keep imagining her having sex with somebody instead, dinner with me the last thing on her mind.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>1-10 t</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>I have trouble experience feelings of abundance and scarcity now. after my last days at home, the break just ended.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>I hate that the sun sets later down here, and will just keep setting later and later as winter fades.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>I did end up meeting with alice again, and I&apos;m sure I left with that annoying, hopeless optimism again. after encountering even more trouble locating her, she finally climbed into my car by the place where I got high. I had trouble overcoming my overwhelming inertia, and initially she didn&apos;t seem too excited either. seemed like mostly obligation for her. at first I didn&apos;t care.</div><div><br/></div><div>we stopped by the amazon office where she dropped the package containing my keyboard off for me. there was more traffic than I expected on ga-13. she talked about an incident with her mother that occurred during thanksgiving, in which she&apos;d gotten angry when alice had mentioned to her that she regularly gets herself tested for stds. so the thoughts that I once considered dark are confirmed, and it made me weak inside. the way alice talked so casually about hooking up with people, how normal it was for her and people like her. I couldn&apos;t picture her having sex with anybody, and it somehow happens. my own lack of experience means I have no sense of judgement whatsoever when it comes to this. I offhandedly said that that&apos;s never how it went for me, but she ignored it.</div><div><br/></div><div>my voice was pretty flat the whole time again. this now occurs when talking to anybody.</div><div><br/></div><div>she plugged my aux cord into her phone and played a few songs, none of which resonated with me the slightest bit. I&apos;m always eager to share from my own playlists, hopelessly trying to permeate my personal imprints that the music has on my memories.</div><div><br/></div><div>alice kept saying that we&apos;re good friends now (leading to questions about what her criteria are) and also kept saying that we should hang out more frequently. no matter how wary I can be, I will never be able to resist that hope. I don&apos;t know why, but for now we may hang out again this weekend. she wants to marathon the original star wars trilogy.</div><div><br/></div><div>considering it&apos;s been a solid year since that january 2016 hangout with the two of us, I wonder how the in-between time passed for her. to me, the year was no time at all, time lost. no changes. but I can&apos;t tell if she&apos;s any different. she tells me that I always say the same things when she asks how I&apos;m doing, whatever plans I have. I got the opportunity to read some lines from my script though.</div><div><br/></div><div>the gap between the conversations in my mind and in reality is almost too wide to see from one side to the other. I replay my side countless times after.</div><div><br/></div><div>I hope I won&apos;t come to regret opening up to her and releasing as much information as I did over dinner tonight. I told her far more than I ever told my brother. about how single I am and how my parents and everyone want me to date somebody, but I don&apos;t know how to look. she asked if there&apos;s anyone at my workplace I might be interested in and I mentioned the Jessica. alice encouraged me to talk to her. it seems so impossible.</div><div><br/></div><div>she paid for the food and I let her. we went to a bubble tea place across the street and she covered me there too.</div><div><br/></div><div>on the way back I showed her explosions in the sky. the album from early last summer. she seemed to enjoy it, and if she ends up listening to the entire album, it&apos;ll be a completely different experience for her than it was for me. mine is lame. I also tried some early binding to loscil, but I think the ambiance is too muddy to hold anything.</div><div><br/></div><div>I entered her dorm in north ave (nave) when we went to drop her stuff off. I took some photos of the place. I know this is a moment I Will be looking back to. the room is laid out in the same way as the one jenny oh lived in those years back, when she made me the udon noodles. alice&apos;s room overlooks the highway, and the cars&apos; perpetual droning is something I would have loved to fall asleep to back then. I think it would have facilitated feeling like part of something.</div><div><br/></div><div>I drove her to her meeting with the club china care (small world everywhere), where she no longer holds any interest in being president (!). she reiterated our weekend meeting and I left. now all that remains is to wait for something else to go awry. I can&apos;t stop envisioning us somehow getting close and cuddling, or going further than that.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>1-11 w</b></div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s only been a few days, but nothing has changed. I&apos;m surrounded by the same things. looking for new things. going to bed past 1 am.</div><div><br/></div><div>I feel better after talking to people. or just someone. that&apos;s how it&apos;s always been, but I still refuse to learn how to work for it.</div><div><br/></div><div>I mentioned to bina that I need recommendations for my grad school app and she instantly said, &quot;okay!&quot; even though I wasn&apos;t even asking her. I&apos;m not sure if she thought I was. but it was a pleasant surprise and it made my morning. and made me realize that she&apos;s probably a connection I should try to foster.</div><div><br/></div><div>I asked the Jessica a question today, maybe just to say to alice if I see her soon enough that I did &quot;talk&quot; to her. but it was a legitimate question. the tension between two people who are always together but never talk is glaring.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m getting very attached to my image of alice this weekend, an event that&apos;s so important to me and that has a good chance of not even happening. planning and preparing for an improbable to impossible path, but I&apos;m so blinded by its allure. subconsciously setting expectations and I can&apos;t stop it. there&apos;ll probably be other people, at the very least. why would she seriously want to marathon the star wars movies anyway? that would take so long.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>1-17 t</b></div><div><br/></div><div>tuesday morning. the three-day weekend&apos;s abundance ran out quickly.</div><div><br/></div><div>I saw a small thing last week that got me thinking about something I&apos;ve already suspected but deep down didn&apos;t want to be true. at tannour with christian, we ran into someone from work who I&apos;ve seen before but who he clearly knew better than me, because they loudly joked and laughed for a second. talked in a manner he never does with me. this confirms that he&apos;s only the way he is around me, when he&apos;s with me. just as I am with him. a custom personality.</div><div><br/></div><div>he also said something about how one day he&apos;ll make &quot;big money&quot; like me. that&apos;s something that DOOGIE has done several times too. offhandedly mention how much money I have even though at least I know it can&apos;t be that much more than what they make.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>I felt like I was starving for half the weekend. simply because I kept delaying so long before reheating/going out to buy food. I can&apos;t even prioritize that properly. this inertia seems to have gotten worse. the weight&apos;s doubled. and I&apos;ve only been back here for a week. is this depression?</div><div><br/></div><div>perhaps the reason I don&apos;t break ties with DOOGIE, aside from the fact that we&apos;ve met twice now, once with my family, is that he&apos;s the one putting the most effort into our...relationship. even if it&apos;s only because he wants to play L4D2 constantly, the level that he does it at is unprecedented to me. that must hold value than I&apos;d ever like to admit. I still can&apos;t tell who&apos;s training who. maybe it goes both ways. I open steam and just wait. and he comes almost every time, like clockwork. mostly reliable thus far. it&apos;s some status quo, giving me the feeling that I have some kind of advantage, and I want to keep that even though it&apos;s no good for me at all.</div><div><br/></div><div>I keep telling myself, one more thing, one more thing until? I have 100% everything in rottr now, after grinding for another four hours yesterday, obsessively playing the game like no other since dead space 2/3 back in college. could this be a sign. I still don&apos;t want to let go of it. still just want to run around in the environment and savor the quiet.</div><div><br/></div><div>quiet is all I have now.</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>1-21 s</b></div><div><br/></div><div>every now and then I find myself thinking about my past periods. early 2015, late 2015, early 2016. early 2015, two years ago. two entire years, and yet, only two years? I&apos;ve lost track completely of how long I&apos;ve been continually thinking about the whole simultaneously-long-ago-and-recent thing. late 2015 was only barely more than a year ago, which makes me want to hold onto the memory of it as desperately as I can, only I already can&apos;t and it will never stop accelerating away. november 2015 was part of <i>2015</i>. I first re-encountered alice in <i>2015</i>!</div><div><br/></div><div>even something as simple as feeding myself is becoming a dreadful task. I can&apos;t keep doing this but I also can&apos;t foresee any change. surely it has to? is what I used to think. I&apos;d look ahead at the months, years ahead of me that are now behind me, and think that my life will certainly get better and move closer to how I&apos;d like it to be, all on its own, without my input. now I&apos;m looking at the 11 months remaining this year, and now I know that there&apos;s nothing good and exciting hiding underneath the hazy future. the time I have is not a lot of time at all. it should be enough to make many good things happen, but not when I&apos;m doing what I&apos;m doing.</div><div><br/></div><div>my thoughts have become my actions, and my actions are clockwork. I&apos;m just going to wait for my t-shirts now.</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><hr/></div><div><b><br/></b></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">1-3 w</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I haven&apos;t written anything about the return trip yet.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I woke up on saturday and saw that it had snowed a bit overnight, much to my surprise. the morning was spent packing. I had much less stuff to worry about this year than previous years. the plan was to stop again at the mall in delaware. we did and my dad picked up his iphone x. my brother and I bought drinks at a starbucks tucked into a corner, that was closer than the pseudo-sbux I ended up at on the way up and had somehow missed then. the peppermint mochas seem to get worse every time. we didn&apos;t hang around for very long and left after deciding to stop at the mall in virginia that contained a uniqlo store. I skipped through the ocremix playlist on the ipod nano and didn&apos;t say much as my mom talked. the virginia mall was even bigger than the delaware one, with a big multi-level parking garage that had red and green lights on the ceilings above the parking spots indicating whether it was taken or not. I had never seen anything like that before. we spent a little while longer walking throughout this one. I felt self-conscious in my grey sweatpants and white sweater. I messaged nita a little. we ate at the shitty food court and I watched some teenagers. and then we were off to the first hotel.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">it was dark and quiet, and not very full.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">the next morning we ate at a shitty ihop, then decided to drive the toyota 57 miles to the shenandoah caverns tourist spot. drove through a lot of long, empty, countryside roads. I would hate to get stuck here. I wanted to take so many pictures but couldn&apos;t because I was driving and anyway I still wasn&apos;t used to the size of the bigger phone I just got. two pairs of uphill/downhill, winding mountain roads. it reminded me of twin peaks a little bit.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">the caverns area was again very quaint and quiet. a small gravel parking lot, a visitors&apos; center with a lot of gift shop stuff. there were a lot of little frog statues and I considered sending a picture of them to the Amanda. we went on a tour through the caverns, which we had to take an old elevator down to. our tour guide was a young girl who looked like the goodnight moon asmr girl. she wasn&apos;t bad, but her tidbits were clearly and well rehearsed, although I heard her say that this was her first time here. these caverns are some millions of years old or whatever. I never paused to think about how we were walking around ancient rock formations that had formed over incomprehensible stretches of time. all I was thinking about was how many lights had been wired around the place.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">my dad drove back to the hotel to fetch our other car, driving much faster than me, and I took the chance to take a few pictures now. and then we set off for the second hotel, the familiar courtyard.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">we first regrouped at chipotle, then settled into our room where mom browsed her ipad, dad opened his iphone, and I rewatched the first two episodes of black mirror season 4 with my brother. when midnight came, I noted that the tv broadcast was 15-16 seconds delayed behind real time. we toasted with some apple cider in paper cups. sent a few texts, maybe, I don&apos;t remember. it wasn&apos;t a big deal. alice said she was asleep during her midnight moment.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I kept forgetting what day it was throughout the few days surrounding new year&apos;s. we got breakfast at the hotel lobby. and my mom wanted to take a picture of me and my brother hugging. she hugged me and my dad shook my hand.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.45;">each time, it gets less sad parting ways.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I stopped at the same starbucks in north carolina, and recognized the same girl as the one at the counter when I stopped there on the way up. her nametag said rebecca.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">(the rest of the drive)</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">unpacking made easier. a few boxes to open because I had ordered stuff delivered here. a mini post-xmas xmas.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">the next day felt later than the second day of the year. everything reverted to normal in record time. then again the routine wasn&apos;t broken for nearly as long. barely a single week. the daily skype call again. sitting next to Zach again. we talked a little bit about how our holidays were. I had received a message from Cody a couple days ago asking if I was in town because he wanted to invite me out, which was a pleasant surprise. Amanda still has little to say. it&apos;s been too long since we last saw each other for anything to happen.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">&lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE never sent a new year text, which I noticed. I wonder if he&apos;s upset that I didn&apos;t want to go out of my way to hang out with in in new york.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">1-7 n</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">yesterday I decided I&apos;d waited long enough before asking Amanda to hang out again, so I asked. and she ended up inviting me to a brewery to watch a football game with her. I wasn&apos;t sure what that meant, but I was about to find out.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">she proposed meeting up at a restaurant on buford highway for dinner before taking an uber to monday night garage. there was no mention of other people but I wasn&apos;t expecting it to be just me and her. still, I made sure I looked alright, putting on a sweater and the black denim jacket. felt like a fool as I even used a bit of the cologne. felt like a fool as I climbed into my car, which was at least clean now, put in the directions in google maps, and drove myself over there.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">Amanda got there first, and it was indeed just her. I was afraid to feel almost normal. not too nervous, trying to remain from being invested. I didn&apos;t feel that self-conscious. I was okay with people glancing at me. because this time I was here with this cute girl.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">here are some things I&apos;ve learned after focusing on this person:</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">after hanging out with Amanda this second time, I was able to form a better picture of her modus operandi. our perspectives on friends and relationships are so far apart it would have been impossible for either of us to tell what the other had been thinking. she brought up so many friends as she was talking that it just made me sad and overwhelmed me trying to imagine having such an apparently large network of people. she&apos;s also one of those people who refers to them all by name, sometimes with no introduction. I guess she talks to so many that she forgets who knows who and what. that could also be why she kept forgetting things like that she was already following me on instagram. and also thought that I was on snapchat because apparently she recalls snapping people pictures of her frog statues, but not that she told me about them through messenger.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">she mentioned her boyfriend in one line and it was like something went off in my head. I&apos;m pretty sure my fell visibly fell. I wonder if she picked up on that or any subsequent attitude change. I think I became a little quieter after that, and even lost my appetite a little bit. the food wasn&apos;t bad but also wasn&apos;t great. when she asked how the 6-hour braised beef noodle soup I ordered was, I said it was good. I don&apos;t remember asking her about her food. she let me try a piece. for a second I tried imagining what she would look and sound like while having sex.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">the way she talks about her dog is odd and intimidating. I didn&apos;t understand it. she has an old, ugly chihuahua. he doesn&apos;t like me and I don&apos;t like him.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">she&apos;s really into sports and football, an area I have zero interest in so there&apos;s no overlap there at all.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">she asked me about nj but I feel like I didn&apos;t say very much. there were a lot of times when I had nothing to say in response to the things she said, so I just said nothing. she probably knows so many other people who are way more engaging than me anyway. who would know better things to say in response to her telling them about her job teaching math to special ed kids. I mean she was telling me about it, but maybe I seemed too uninterested because she didn&apos;t go too in-depth.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">she thought it was cute that I wanted to take a picture of the inside of the restaurant.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I briefly went over to her house, in a neighborhood off buford highway. it&apos;s a renovated little office. looked like a pretty ordinary home. Having anyone over is probably totally normal for her and someone that requires no thought, but for me, even just staying a few minutes was a significant enough event. I took a few pictures of the interior just for me to remember. will I ever be back here for any reason?</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">on the uber ride over to the brewery, I caved and told nita about what I was up to and how I couldn&apos;t understand why Amanda would want to spend any time with me at all. she offered a couple suggestions: that she&apos;s being smart and is networking, that she likes attention and that I give amazing attention. I would really like if she meant that sincerely. I hope she did, and wasn&apos;t just telling me things to make me feel good about myself. also I still don&apos;t know how into me nita might be, so I need to be careful just how personal I get with her.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">how smart is Amanda? does she realize how much attention I&apos;m certain she gets because of how pretty she is? is she aware of how easily she was able to drag me out to come see her? I still feel a little pathetic thinking about that.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">google maps directed us to the wrong street, and as neither of us had been to this brewery before, we had no idea where to go and decided to get out of the car at a gas station on the corner. walking on foot following the maps still got us nowhere because there was nothing to be found on either side of this street. it was cold, dark and deserted, and who knew how dangerous. we were ready to call it quits when the uber driver we had was nice enough to stop by next to us again, and we got back in and eventually ended up finally finding the place. by this time there were only a few minutes left in the game, that I was never interested in anyway. Amanda kept apologizing for this being a bust.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I felt the familiar unfamiliarity, the sense of being out of place and not belonging where I was setting foot into. the inside of the brewery was spacious and probably much emptier than it had been earlier in the night. she got something to drink because the uber driver&apos;s driving had given her a headache, and I got something because it would have been too awkward not too. we ended up getting the same beer. sat down at a table and watched the game being project on the wall, on which a grid of animal heads were mounted.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">there were only a few minutes left and she kept cheering and clapping watching the game, while I had no idea what the fuck was happening. she tried explaining some of it to me. I just sipped my blood orange ipa and followed her into the other large room and back. she said it looked like I wasn&apos;t having fun. well I didn&apos;t care about the football. I wasn&apos;t invested in her anymore. but the experience, that should be ordinary, was new to me, so for the time being, I continued welcoming it. I looked around at all the people. I felt okay because I was sure I looked good in the jacket I was wearing.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">we went back to our original table and she took a picture of me. then something happened with Amanda&apos;s younger sister; apparently she ran away from their parents&apos; house and the police were involved in looking for her. so I guess she has some family issues too. I wasn&apos;t very supportive about the ordeal. I didn&apos;t know how to be. I kept thinking back to what nita had told me about girls wanting guys to be caring. even if that weren&apos;t in my mind at all, my motivations were still selfish, as I tried to determine the perfect level of caring to be towards Amanda without seeming overbearing. anyway, after we took an uber back to her house, I&apos;m sure I was one of the last things on her mind as she figured out what to do with her sister and how to get her back to her parents&apos; house.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">a girl named Hannah and one of her friends joined our uber ride. she sounded just like a stereotypically ditzy girl, probably drunk. I wondered how much sex she&apos;s had and what she looked and sounded like during it. she, her friend, and Amanda were all on their phones the whole time. I just sat there.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">at Amanda&apos;s house again, I met her roommate Jin (sp?), and she started talking to him, telling him some of the same things she had already said to me. there&apos;s never been less reason for me for me to stay somewhere, so I left.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">1-16 t</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">last night I had a rare comforting dream with mary-ann for some reason. she was rubbing my head and I felt calm next to her. we were in china.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I think I&apos;ve been sinking into another depressive phase, I can feel it happening, the nature of my thoughts shifting. the same procrastination and lethargy. the hopelessness and negativity again. I can&apos;t identify a trigger. there&apos;s no way it can be Amanda. it would be disgusting if she could have an effect like this on me.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">it&apos;s like all of the progress I made at the end of last year was for nothing. or it wasn&apos;t really much progress at all. or that it&apos;ll be undone soon, yet again.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I&apos;ve waited over a week to now note what &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE advised me to go regarding Amanda, which is to just drop her. my knee-jerk reaction was to go against what he said automatically, but I somewhat sarcastically agreed, then actually kind of agreed, because I realized I felt no connection with her. I only like her at all because she&apos;s cute. anyway I haven&apos;t talked to her in over a week now and unless I start, I&apos;ll probably never hear from her again and that&apos;ll be that.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I met up with nita last friday for lunch and she showed up some 40 minutes later than she said she would. I actually started getting annoyed waiting for her. she&apos;s started a keto diet and was obsessively measuring her intake of carbs and shit. I didn&apos;t understand it. we went to the cupcakes place next door, where she straight up asked me to buy (a small) one for her. and I hesitated because I couldn&apos;t really believe what she was asking me, and she began acting sad when it seemed like I wouldn&apos;t buy one. I ended up doing so because I wanted to end the situation.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">plus I&apos;m not attracted to her at all and I think I&apos;m just using her for validation at this point. she says positive things, but they sometimes feel forced. Amanda is nothing, I rarely interact with the Cody, and that&apos;s everybody. I&apos;m afraid last year&apos;s october through december will just be yet another fever dream.</span></div><div><br style="font-family: Segoe UI;"/></div><div><hr/><div><b>1-25 r</b></div></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">yesterday I saw christian for the first time in months, and for a moment it all felt the same as it always used to. he was wearing a beanie and glasses that I thought were ugly. we didn&apos;t do any exercises together, and as was usual I didn&apos;t know what to say to him. I think he left without saying anything to me, because when I was finished I didn&apos;t see him anywhere.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">last weekend I hiked a trail with Cody and his friend whom he&apos;s mentioned many times, a Dorothy. she&apos;s pretty loud and chatty and I could see us getting alone. a middle-aged woman, older than I was expecting. I got to see how Cody behaves around someone he might be more comfortable with than me. she repeated a couple times that I looked dressed up for our hike, and I wondered if maybe Cody thought so too and thought I did so because I might have wanted to look good for her.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">I felt relaxed because I didn&apos;t feel the need to impress anybody, and allowed my voice to lower. Cody talked with Dorothy more than me.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">lately I&apos;ve regressed to feeling anxious, hopeless, lethargic, depressed, you name it. this morning I messaged a few people almost out of desperation. I&apos;ve been feeling that nita doesn&apos;t want to talk to me as much as she initially did shortly after we met, and I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m wrong. last week I kind of agreed with the Amanda to go to dinner some place this week, but I&apos;m sure she forgot and I&apos;m not going to remind her.</span></div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<hr/>
7-01; sunday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>an eventful night, but not my definition of exciting. i was ready to stay in my room instead of going to the black sheep to watch the eurocup final because of some unrelenting rain. opportunities kept presenting themselves to me though; tyler asked me if i wanted to leave, then i saw a group just starting to go when i walked out the door to buy a kebab, then saw another group who had just bought kebabs walking back so i ended up meeting with them and then trudging through slightly less unrelenting rain, that still plastered my pants to my legs, to the nice big open bar where i still got a chair to sit down. all of the people were there and there was beer all over the fucking place. i'm usually not sober enough to notice how much alcohol we buy, or perhaps we just had a larger than usual amount because of the football game. a condom got tossed around. chris tried to make a funny remark about it. i don't find other peoples' disinterest in talking to me as conspicuous as i do when it comes from dani. spain won against italy 4-0 and it the match was as exciting as a match can get. it felt like all of the best action in the tournament somehow got reserved for this last game, and i just happened to make the precarious decision to come watch it. i drank nothing at the bar and walked home silently alongside three girls. no interest in celebratory partying. i cling to tyler too much.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>earlier today tyler asked if i wanted to go see the gay pride parade so i ended up walking with him, reid, ashley, sean, and dani through a torrent of rain and puddles. exited the metro at espanya where the parade was supposed to end and no one was there. my jacket was a little small and i've never had to wear it before. shared churros. didn't buy a mojito. didn't jump and bounce on a trampoline thingy because i didn't want to take my shoes off and get wet and my feet dirty. lived a little bit less then.</div>
<div><br/></div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>some things i saw today: </div>
<div>a girl leaning on her mother, crying. a man clutching his son's hand only to roughly throw it away from him with a rather angry expression on his face when the subway doors closed. people staring at him as they got on the escalator. other people eating alone at mcdonald's. i ate alone there too (never thought that would actually happen).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>after the museum tour i followed steve wojcio and chip leigh and chris stout, people who've i've basically never talked to before, to the universitat metro station but i wanted to go back to the green line so i let them go down the stairs without me and walked back to the green line myself and got me a smaller towel at el corte inglés. ate two burgers at mcdonald's alone (too much) and have been sitting in my room ever since. considering using the rest of my vodka for vodka red bull and pointlessly drinking it myself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
7-04; wednesday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>two nights ago i got drunk from a vodka red bull i drank by myself in my room. i took my bottle of malibu to patrick's room and kept drinking that for a little while. rita joined us and she hugged me. i had my arm around her for a minute after that, until she said her shoulder got tired. we went to the tv room for a bit where i remember chip was there and two others who i don't remember. went back to patrick's room where i watched the beginning of a movie for a bit before deciding to return to my room because i wanted to sleep. took a shower drunk. woke up drunk. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm glad i ate so much last night before going to sleep or i would be even hungrier than i am now. eddy woke me up at 6:20 today by loudly opening the door. out of bed an hour later, out of onix another hour later. this time i had second thoughts about not packing everything lightly into a backpack, because most people actually had backpacks now. i thought of all the stuff i packed this time that i didn't pack last time that i probably didn't need to pack this time either but did. me tyler sean marie caroline ethan john eddy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>john gave us all hugs at the aeroport train station, where we parted for different terminals. eddy grabbed my hand/luggage handle and i didn't know what he was doing until i turned around and realized he wanted to give me handshake. tyler said to me that he felt that eddy might have felt unliked, because he also kind of forced a hug on tyler himself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ethan gave us all hugs at the terminal. me tyler sean marie caroline. we ate sandwiches while marie explained german to us. bumped into alannah and becky. check-in and boarding were seamless. tyler's and my bags were small enough to not have to be checked. tyler 1 ryanair 0. i slept for 6 minutes of the flight and couldn't fall asleep for the rest. we landed after flying over mountains and valleys and small towns and poofy clouds and my right ear wouldn't pop. marie's eyes are a stunning blue. a tiny spider crawled around my left hand and shot a strand of web or something between my open fingers and crawled across it. then it jumped off. i wish we could rent a car.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a taxi took us to the train station, which we left almost 3 hours ago now and still haven't reached munich yet after two train transfers. i like the way the trains softly hum and how they bank when turning. they also travel a lot faster than i thought, cruising at around 150 km/h. i'm trying to write this as fast as i can so i can go back to staring out windows. we had an entire section of the upper floor of a double decker car to ourselves and everyone tried to sleep and couldn't, but it was really quiet for a while. the houses are quaint and red and make me think of board game house pieces, and the rest of the scenery is such a beautiful green. i think trains have become my favorite mode of transportation. sean commented on how surreal it felt to be in germany, and i wish i could feel that strange surreal emotion again too. i keep getting that feeling you get in your chest when your hearts keeps on skipping beats purely out of happiness.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>just bought a buttered pretzel from a man pushing a little food cart around. we're all starving and i'm the only one not excited for beer, which i still want to keep trying.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>something's still wrong with my right ear.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now just thinking about how lucky i was to manage booking the same train, hostels, and flights as everyone else. we're looking over attractions and making plans and looking forward to eating and drinking beer. honestly, seriously, do not want to think about how lost i'd be without them.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>weather forecasts predict heavy rain for the entire time we'll be in munich. it's still sunny though.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
7-07; saturday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this is the rest of wednesday: </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>red lights: münchen not printed anywhere on our ticket; the fact that our train journey lasted 3 whole hours; the city seeming quite small for one as not-small as munich.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we got off the train at munich and made our way out of the station and asked a lady at the information desk where we could find our hostel. she recognized the name and said we could find one in munich. we thought &quot;what.&quot; turns out the ticket woman in memmingen had given us wrong directions and sent us 149km away from munich to nürnburg. i think marie nearly fainted. i blinked. sean unfolded a great big map and we were able to see just how far off we had gone (very far). went back to the train station and caroline bought a box of strawberries. went back to the information desk and asked the lady for a restaurant recommendation because we decided to stay and spend our evening in nürnburg since the last train from here to munich would leave at about 21:30 and it was only between 17-18:00 now. shared the strawberries on the short walk to the restaurant. the most delicious strawberries i have ever eaten in my life.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at the restaurant whose name i don't remember we all get a hefeweizen and we all got the same wursts except marie who ordered something that was probably better. i couldn't finish my sauerkraut. i couldn't finish my hefeweizen. i barely drank any of it. i think i'm the only person in the entire country who doesn't enjoy beer. just another thing wrong with me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we walked through the city, tyler and i dragging our luggage over painful cobblestone. the cigarettes here smell different. the town isn't touristy and i felt self-conscious of all the noise my bag made as i dragged it all over the place. felt bad for the wheels. we reached the other side of the city in about half an hour. walked through a castle or something. got a beautiful view from the top, where we could see all the red rooftops. trekked back to nürnburg hbf and didn't have to buy any new tickets, which was convenient because at least we wouldn't be wasting any money on travel costs.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we just laughed it off, it was all okay. life's funny. we went to the wrong city.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>concentrated my gaze on the middle of the train car and watched the trees blur past out of the corner of my eyes. every time we went through a tunnel and lights whizzed by i was reminded of the star gate sequence from 2001. watched cars on the highway passing our hundred mile per hour train. a high-speed train going in the opposite direction screeched by us in a second. slept woke slept woke.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>signs reading münchen hbf when we arrived told us we were in the right city this time. near midnight. disembarked. looked for wi-fi. looked for food. unhelpful taxi drivers. impatient person i paid for a crappy doner kebab. we asked for directions to our hostel, which is located on in der kirschen 30, but the street didn't end in &quot;straße&quot; and no one could find it even though that's how it always appears on google maps. found directions after finding wi-fi at a starbucks. couldn't figure out how to pay for tickets for our tram ride, so we didn't. there were many other people also on their way to the tent so we didn't have to walk down the dark street by ourselves.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it's indeed just a giant tent with 100 beds spread throughout (there's a second smaller tent too). if i hadn't heard about this hostel earlier and known what it would be like i would have severely caught off guard. it harkened back to the few camping trips i had gone on during my very brief stint as a boy scout. we were provided with only a mattress and they gave us 4 thick scratchy blankets. seeing people with all of their stuff laying about and sleeping everywhere brought a unique sense of camaraderie and trust. a big campfire burned outside that people crowded around. we sat at a lounge area and looked up things to do tomorrow on my laptop because it's the only computer we had. i was glad to be of use. i finally figured out how the lock on my suitcase worked, and that the combination is 000.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>went to bed at 1:30 and kept waking up to the most disgusting, wet, snarling snoring i have ever. heard. i think i woke up at least 3 times to it and thought that that guy must be keeping the whole tent awake.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this happened thursday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a much needed shower. you have to keep pressing a button to get the water flowing. the knob has a temperature indicator. the tent has nice cheap breakfast and okay-tasting tap water. we rented bikes and were excited. it had been several years since most of us had ridden a bike and marie took a little while to get used to riding and turning again but it was okay. caroline was our chief navigator. we biked into the city center on our way to see the glockenspiel and two polices stopped us on a street running through a big plaza that we weren't allowed to ride through. later we saw possibly one of the same polices writing a ticket for another guy who was also on a bike and were thankful we weren't given tickets. maybe they were too lazy to write five of them for all of us.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we locked our bikes around a tree and missed the glockenspiel ringing since we had to walk. caroline bought sunglasses. fruit stands everywhere. caroline bought blueberries. marie bought peaches. i bought strawberries and a drop of juice dripped onto my shirt as soon as i bit into the first one. walked through a church with incense floating around. we paid a euro to climb narrow stairs to the top of a tower. pictures of nice views of munich and red rooftops and colorful people dotting the plaza below.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>there are attractive people EVERYwHERE. and german is such a cute language. i've only ever heard it spoken in either war movies with hitler or when listening to rammstein, and neither of them make german sound pretty. but hearing ordinary people and cute girls speak it makes me want to squeal. i desperately want to learn. everybody here speaks english.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a nice cheap gelato. we biked back to the train station (&quot;asshole parking: bike edition&quot; -sean) for a tour about hitler and the 3rd reich, i think. tyler and i thought about buying a pack of cigarettes, smoking just one, and tossing the rest, but agreed it was a bad idea and never did. trying to stand still in the heat while our guide talked made me woozy. i didn't listen to what our tour guide was saying. he was from london. porsches. audi r8. ferrari 360. volkswagen phaetons. all the cars have diesel engines and sound like little trucks. walked until my feet hurt and kept walking until my feet didn't hurt. followed our guide to a metro back to the train station without buying tickets. entered the train from the left and exited on the right. retrieved bikes, pedaled to the english gardens. my bike's broken bell kept ringing every time i hit a bump.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we rode through trails going every which way. stopped by the water for a little while. ducks are funny and their bills look like dogs. swans are huge ass birds that look like they can really do some damage. continued biking and noticed one of the swans fishing around with its head and most of its neck underwater and tyler remarked on how fascinating it was. i replied everything is fascinating if you stare at it long enough and that most people don't stare. i didn't stare at the swan for very long and rushed off to catch up with our group.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>reached a big open field/meadow dotted with people that our tour guide had apparently mentioned and said that people still like to lay and walk around naked in. he was right. we spotted a couple old naked men and were very glad they were far away. guys were in various levels of dress and girls were in bikinis. never seen girls in bikinis not on a beach. it wasn't even very hot out. we stopped by another river with guys swimming around holding beer bottles. one of them appeared to hurt his wrist and another guy helped him up and then pushed him back into the water. we all badly wanted to jump in the water but wanting dry clothes kept us from having fun.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we passed a random chinese-like pagoda-like building that didn't belong and reached the beer garden. sat on the edge of water and got beers and wursts and fries. i didn't get beer, i got orange fanta. there was a big rain cloud in the distance and then it got closer and we moved away from the water to a table under a big tent just before it began raining. people swarmed in. i got half a liter of light beer and drank it all. it was an accomplishment for me and i gagged when i took too big a gulp to finish it off. was barely buzzed at all, probably because half a liter isn't enough and i took about an hour to finish it all.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we sat and ate while it rained for an hour, almost two. camera flashes and lightning. played &quot;interrogation&quot; and i asked sean when his worst birthday was. everyone liked my question, which i wouldn't have been able to answer myself. i wish i had more stories about my life to tell.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>decided to take our chances and leave when the rain eased up. we wiped our bike seats dry with paper towels from the bathroom. our headlamps were powered by the front wheel spinning. retraced our path and rode through the dark forest trail in the rain. couldn't imagine what we'd do if our bikes didn't have lights. how lucky were we to be given bikes with front lights? soft sounds of the forest and our bikes riding through wet dirt, and cool clear air. we reached the city and it rained on and off and we cast away all qualms we had with getting soaked. decided against taking a tram because our 5 bikes would likely not fit. marie kept getting left behind at stoplights. lightning flashes would illuminate the entire city for half a second at a time. never felt the cold unless we stopped at lights.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in all we biked several miles through the rain and thunder from the park back to the tent. caroline cheered when we finally saw the sign. we were nicely drenched and my hair was dripping and i couldn't see out of my glasses. people stared just a little. sat in the lounge area for a bit and freaked out over urvashi's facebook status claiming she had just survived a plane crash. tyler talked a little bit with a bunch of girls from england and switzerland who were smoking next to us. i kept pleading to leave because i wanted to change out of my wet clothes and eventually left by myself and changed into dry clothes and of course everyone else had disbanded by the time i was on my way back. took a warm shower. passed out well before 1am, falling asleep to people talking and laughing and clapping outside.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>friday 6 july</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today was day trip to salzburg in austria day. it was a 1.5 hour train ride to the city. we got off and acquired maps and cash. the atm gave caroline big green pretty €100 euro bills. we walked and bought umbrellas just as it started to rain. walked through gardens. funny statues of naked people and unicorns. it rained for an hour or so and my umbrella blocked the sky. i had to dodge puddles to so i spent a lot of time looking down while walking.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we visited a mozart museum. i stabbed my thumb on a sharp piece of my broken phone case. took an audio tour and listened to mozart's jams.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at a food stand i bought a chicken sandwich thing and the others bought giant pretzels with cheese and tons of ham. walked walked walked. more weird statues. found the oldest bakery in all of salzburg. wandered through a beautiful little cemetery (&quot;america's not doing it right&quot; -marie). climbed up rocky stairs inside a cliffside and marie and sean deciphered some plaques engraved with latin.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>walked more past a pile of horse shit and i bought a chocolate covered doughnut shaped like a pretzel and a little glass owl. rode a funicular up the hill to the giant hohensalzburg castle. i stared at where the stone wall met the ground and couldn't wrap my head around how all this was built. went on another audio tour. one of the stops was the &quot;torture chamber&quot; where prisoners used to be kept and a little girl played with the handcuffs hanging from the wall and grabbed onto one while asking her mother to take a picture of her in &quot;prison.&quot; walked to a viewing platform at the top of the castle and couldn't find any of the buildings the prerecorded audio tour guy was talking about. the city and the river on one side, mountains on the other. tyler asked a girl to take a picture of us and handed her the camera while it was off. another woman asked the same girl to take a picture of her and had left her iphone in video mode.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>while wandering around after the tour was over we found a room filled with abstract art featuring random food and fried chicken. a piece titled &quot;americas&quot; was simply a photo of a supermarket shelf. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>rode the funicular back down and we were on our way back to salzburg hbf. i hadn't had anything to drink in 7 hours. unknowingly bought a bottle of seltzer water at the market. how is normal water is so difficult to come by. the train door closed in our faces literally just as we were about to step on and we freaked but one person was nice enough to open it from inside. then the train moved no more than 10m and stopped again. we fell asleep until we all started talking about academics. i have to look up tech's international plan as soon as i can. the sun set.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at munich we made for a bavarian restaurant but took the tram line going in the opposite direction for several stops and then marie wasn't feeling well so we decided to hail a cab to the hirschgarten. the cab driver was very nice and fluent in english. we arrived half an hour before it closed and instead of telling us that we wouldn't be able to get served the waiters just stood around avoiding us and looking pissed. we left and walked until we found a french restaurant which would be open for another hour and were helped by the sweetest french german guy who translated all the menu options for us. he quickly realized that i wasn't talkative. we had a deep discussion about religion while eating that i only listened to. the food wasn't cheap but our stomachs weren't empty when we walked back.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
7-08; sunday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>saturday 7 july </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in the morning we checked out and sean and marie stayed behind while caroline, tyler and i headed to the hauptbahnhof to drop our luggage off before taking an s-bahn train and then a bus to the former dachau concentration camp. another tour, this time led by a german guy. he knew a lot and spoke without hesitating about sensitive topics after warning us. dachau was far from the largest or deadliest concentration camp but was one of the first and served as a &quot;master camp.&quot; its death rate was relatively very low and only one person ever escaped. cigarettes were a common currency. no mass executions ever occurred here except for one where 4,000 russians were killed. most of the camp is either gone or reconstructed, and i didn't like knowing that it wasn't original. it made it harder for me to imagine what went on here those decades ago. also made the whole place reek less of death than i think it otherwise would have. tyler's camera's memory card ran out of space. the gas chamber building wasn't a reconstruction though. something in me hurt when i looked at the ovens in the crematorium and the gas chamber itself is such a bleak place. it made me want to die. we were walking through rooms where piles and piles of corpses once laid. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the tour ended there and we walked back to the bus stop dodging puddles and i kept staring at one of the cutest girls in the world. she looked at me for an instant and my eyes flicked away before i could do anything about it. she had a gap between her front teeth and her smile reminded me of the cheshire cat.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>regrouped at the train station, rode a tram to a restaurant called FAUN where i got a coke while everyone got a beer and laughed at me. i ordered a wiener schnitzel and started eating it by picking up the entire chunk with my fork and taking big bites. everyone told me to cut it properly and eat more slowly. i didn't listen. was still the last person to finish eating. an apple strudel for dessert gave me a food baby.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>our last tram ride to munich hbf for the last time. we never paid for any of our six tram rides so we all owe transportation authority €240. bid munich good-bye and i headed in the opposite direction from the others to the first class cars. the train went pretty fast. sat in a lonely seat across the aisle from an old couple. i fell asleep for 3 and a half hours and didn't hear any of the music i had playing. my phone was at 11% battery and i hadn't charged it in 4 days. didn't order any food from the menu in front of me. they came by 3 times with mini bueno bars. the first time they left me one because i was sleeping.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>red lights: caroline marie sean tyler were nowhere to be seen; sign read berlin südkreuz instead of hauptbahnhof; just because the old couple got off too didn't mean this stop was mine; the time was 23:22 and the ticket said we'd arrive at berlin hbf at 11:21 but the train was running late. i ignored all of them and got off at the wrong stop. i knew it was the wrong stop before i even got off and ignored myself. the train left. station empty. i went upstairs and asked a security guy if he spoke english in english and he spoke english and told me how to get to berlin hbf from here. the subway map text is too small. i made it without buying tickets, which i couldn't figure out in time anyway, and wandered around the giant berlin station hoping for, and even expecting, a miracle. it happened again when caroline spotted me. she just happened to look in the right direction just as i was about to make for the perfect escalator. what are the odds? i say 100% because this was meant to happen.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>that's what i get for booking first class.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>taxi to our hostel. i'm not in a room with the rest of them and am instead sharing a room with 5 brazilian guys. of course. they're at a club now and will probably wake me up when they come back and the windows are open and a street light is right next to the window. perfect. 3 more nights..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>

7-09; monday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sunday 8 july </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>another sweet cheap breakfast. after finishing eating i stepped outside and got my first glimpse of berlin in the daytime. we headed for the brandenburg gate. the walk/don't walk sign figures have their own history and beep/tick when they're green. a lot of postcards come with an enclosed piece of rock that are probably pieces of the berlin wall. the city has old/new building contrasts everywhere and is noticeably still recovering from all the destruction wreaked upon it during war times. construction is going on all over the place and cranes are everywhere. the french and American embassies are located in the square the brandenburg gate overlooks, and so is the €12,000/night hotel adlon that michael jackson once dangled his baby from. i learned that from our tour guide, who we followed on a 3.5-hour tour. we passed the memorial to the murdered jews of europe, an abstract arrangement of 2,711 concrete blocks. the builder never surrendered his intended meaning behind the memorial. we stood on the ground above the spot where hitler killed himself. saw bits of the berlin wall. a little boy who was also on the tour was barefoot the entire time and took pictures of his parents. tyler walked straight into a crotch-level pole and dropped his camera. everybody saw him go down. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we walked around to random buildings for a while until the tour was over and then we walked through a touristy souvenir flea market and i bought a little wooden owl. then a pigeon shat on tyler's camera. bad day. we ignored a lady standing on the curb with her guitar, singing with a nice big smile on her face. returned to and went past the brandenburg gate to look for a place to eat. a mercedes suv with a russian arm camera mounted to its roof drove around a block filming a red mercedes b-class. ignored another group of three people singing/playing guitars. we couldn't find a place to eat that was both good and inexpensive (read: caroline didn't want to spend money) so we walked into a subway. caroline gets testy. tyler says so too.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>made for the tiergarten, berlin's biggest park. walked and talked about hickies and i told the only ghost story i know and successfully freaked everyone out. did a lot of walking today. a rain shower came and went. the path took us alongside the zoo for a bit. saw cranes, llamas, and an owl. stumbled upon a beer garden, which we skipped to go walk around west berlin for a while, where we didn't find anything interesting. so we turned around and got dinner at the beer garden, where i tried and liked the red berliner-weiße beer-mixed-with-syrup that was really sweet and hardly tasted like beer at all. caroline expressed what seemed to me to be exaggerated disgust upon taking a sip, but sean didn't like it either.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>tanner smith and ryan ashcraft found us there. while we all stood at one side of the table to take a picture of ourselves a little bird fluttered onto caroline's plate and grabbed a piece of her schnitzel with its beak. people at the tables next to ours laughed with us.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we started talking about running and marathons, the uncle dolan comics, salad fingers, other weird animated cartoons, and movies, most of which i didn't know. we left and took a subway back to our hostel. i don't usually read the map to navigate but i did this time while we were figuring out which way to walk and i found the right direction to go well before everyone else, who were all still studying the map and they wouldn't pay any attention to me until someone else pointed in the same direction that i had several moments earlier. more frustration brought on by people not noticing me even when i try to speak. it makes me want to give up.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i've only brushed my teeth 4 times so far on this trip.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm too rushed. berlin is a great city. i'm sure. i'm ready to go home.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>

7-10; tuesday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>monday 9 july </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night my hostel roommates kept trickling in one by one and asking if i wanted to go anywhere for the night with them. i said no maybe tomorrow.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>same things for breakfast as yesterday minus yogurt plus an apple. we walked to the fernsehturm tv tower which looks like a combination of toronto's cn tower and shanghai's oriental pearl. marie stayed behind at a bookstore and bought a german food cookbook. we bought tickets to ride the elevator to the top. the security guy was an old pissed off douchebag who made us throw all of our water away. i wanted to come back someday with a big bag full of unopened water bottles and force him to dump it all himself. the elevator ride made my ears pop and it doesn't run along the outside of the tower like the cn tower's does we couldn't see where we were going. the view of berlin from the top was gorgeous of course. there were printed panoramas displayed along the windows but half of them didn't match the view and i couldn't find any of the buildings that were highlighted. the brandenburg gate looked insignificantly small. we were at the perfect height where i could just make out peoples' tiny little legs waddling back and forth. they all looked like tiny little spiders. the trains and cars were so slow. the city looked like it was silently breathing in slow motion.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>rode to the elevator down to the ground, found marie, and walked to the east side gallery. there were bees hovering around from flower to flower in the grass. i almost stepped on one while it was buzzing around a little white flower and wanted to say sorry.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the stretch of berlin wall was over a kilometer long and covered in arts. took pictures of some of the arts. walked past a fake beach in the middle of the city. it almost rained. i wanted it to rain because i had my umbrella this time, but i had taken my umbrella with me because i didn't want it to rain. two girls in weird outfits juggled some bowling pins in front of cars stopped at a red light before taking their hats off and walked around for tips, smiling. they probably didn't get any. very awkward sight.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we were hungry now and the three of us guys were down for kebabs and we were just walking past a kebab place on the other side of the street when tyler proposed kebabs. the girls ignored us. caroline got bitchy again and wouldn't agree to anywhere we wanted to eat. once she asked us all what our hunger level was and i took that to mean she was hungry too but didn't want to say it. she kept asking if we wanted to eat at [insert place nearby/we stopped at], then said that she could keep walking. that meant she didn't want to eat there and if we said we wanted to, there would be conflict. of course none of us had to listen to her but none of us wanted conflict either. tyler, sean, and i talked about her for a bit while eating at a random fast food place attached to a supermarket. she was testy and she and marie even changed their minds about sitting with us while they were walking towards us; they turned around and sat away from us by themselves. meanwhile i thought i asked for kebab but the lady instead cut up half a roasted chicken for me. i just ate it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we kept walking to i don't know where while caroline and marie kept stopping to read a series of signs about some old building projects in the area. eventually returned to alexanderplatz and let the girls loose on a shopping spree, but the high prices quickly fizzed it out. i got some chocolate because my mom wanted me to get chocolate and now i can say i did. i bought gelato served to me by a really cute girl. tyler bought pieces of the berlin wall.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we walked back to the streets surrounding the area our hostel is in and the girls walked into random shops while the guys sat outside (&quot;benches for men!&quot; -tyler). saw attractive girls walking left and right and tried making eye contact with them. a girl sit down on a bench near us and i watched her light a cigarette and five minutes later i watched her drop the butt on the street. tyler and caroline bought shoes. they hurt caroline's feet but not tyler's. saw a mercedes sls. bought a coconut chocolate cream frappuccino at a starbucks and had to wait 15 minutes because someone took mine and they had to make another one. i rubbed the receipt in tyler's hair and he knocked it out of my hand and i picked it up and rubbed it in his hair again. sean rightfully told me to keep my hands to myself. i didn't realize how annoying i was being.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i read the map again while locating the restaurant caroline picked out for us for dinner and again no one would listen to me when i tried pointing out a shorter route.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i wasn't very hungry thanks to the gelato and frappuccino but i ate all of the wiener schnitzel i ordered again. everyone giggled again when i asked for fanta to drink instead of beer and sean asked for a fanta too. i wondered if he did so to make me feel a little better. we stayed for a long while after finishing our food, talking about dan fitzgerald yet again. more confirmation that he's (unintentionally and obliviously) an asshole and living a blind life.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>chilled at our hostel's rooftop bar for a little while. i drank a small glass of beer that apparently was really bad beer (according to sean). also got a rum/coke. went to bed</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my alarm definitely woke everybody else in my hostel room up at 5:30am. gladly packed all my things. someone had stolen my soap and soap container. a quiet walk in crisp cold air to alexanderplatz. a mostly hitchless train ride to schönefeld airport. i saw a sketchy looking hobo dude standing near us at the station, who clapped exactly once for no apparent reason. failed to witness him using one of his calloused hands to grab tyler's throat just as we boarded the train, and i was a little incredulous of his claim. what? the bright red mark that remained on tyler's neck for the next hour bore enough testimony though. bad luck tyler. at least he didn't gut him with a knife. i tried imagining how i'd punch and kick someone grabbing my throat.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>stupid €2,75 0,5l water bottle. brooke, sanat, peter, heather on our flight. boarding from the ground. boarding from both the front and back of the plane. didn't land a window seat, got an aisle seat instead. i fell asleep right after liftoff for only half an hour listening to regina spektor. caroline took a gulp of my water. i thought about stealing the plane's safety information card but it was laminated and too big.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ethan at the train station. boring renfe ride where tyler and caroline actually went through with the plan to tell people that we never visited the reischtag at berlin because it was closed for cleaning, the real reason being that we never registered in advance. i didn't understand why. brooke and peter never joined our conversation because they were too busy kissing and playing with each others' hands.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>felt disregarded during much of the trip. having someone turn to me to ask or tell me anything was rare, and it was usually tyler. it seemed like they almost always only asked me about my journal writing, aka this. frustrating me and myself to no end. i told myself i'd make love my dying breath though, so:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>something to love about marie:</div>
<div>when she laughs so hard her voice starts breaking and she can barely breathe.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>something to love about tyler:</div>
<div>his funny faces, particularly those with duck lips.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>something to love about sean:</div>
<div>pure intelligence not to be underestimated. his embarrassing moments make him more likable. tehe.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>something to love about caroline:</div>
<div>&quot;caroline grylls,&quot; can go caving and diving with nitrogen in her blood and run a million miles without stopping or throwing up.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/></div>
<div>7-11; wednesday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>tired n sleepy n listening to pop music in the background in my head. i met tyler at the lobby and walked with him to class for the first time. he didn't want to go to mcdonald's for breakfast so i didn't go either. he described my writing as poetic. at the classroom sean and marie said they liked my second note. ashley came in later and mentioned my note. sanat commented that i should blog so he can read my writing. i don't know if i should go around parading my tumblr. i think few people would pay attention and i'd soon be forgotten anyway. i didn't talk with anybody. not the people who read my note. no one. i need to listen to blurry dreamy music. i'm obsessed with the lists i've made in clear (iphone app) and keep staring at them and editing them for no reason. i think my mind is sick. i want to throw my computers away because they make me unable to pay attention to or think about anything else. no true friends here. frustrating to no end. got annoyed by people for no reason. i'm an asshole. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this is something i've had in my head for a while</div>
<div>of all the things i put in that list of things i wish are real i wish most strongly that the pensieve is real. i want to go back to day 0 at the airport and day 0.5 at onix's floor -2 and look around at everybody who was there before i knew a single one of them and watch everyone talking with each other at the airport gate and the baggage claim and the onix lobby and relive those early days with the added knowledge and familiarity about them all that i've gained since. too bad that that viewpoint is impossible to look through because it combines two perspectives and i only have one set of eyes. maybe i didn't pay enough attention because the setting scared me or i just don't have a very innate ability to remember faces, because i can barely remember the unopened, newness feeling that always makes me afraid to unwrap people. and then we all open by ourselves however much we feel like, and it doesn't matter how naked we decided to get because one glance at a patch of skin and we can never look at someone the same old new way again.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>things i do</div>
<div>• tumblr</div>
<div>• read personal tumblr blogs</div>
<div>• read tech blogs</div>
<div>• organize evernote notes</div>
<div>• search for music/movies to download</div>
<div>• game casually</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the last thing</div>
<div>phases. i'm not obsessed with drinking now but i'm conscious of the desire to make an effort to learn more about different types of alcohol and how i want to talk and enjoy company with the types of people i've met here. then i start worrying that i'll stop caring about it all once i get back to school and re-associate myself with my old acf asian group and start longing for their companionship again instead, their companionship which i want to rely on only less and less. i'm always terrified of losing any passion i have for things that i've already spent so much time cultivating. once it fades though, if it does, then i won't care or be terrified anymore. i wanted the people here to mean something to me, but i don't mean anything to do them and if the acf people no longer mean anything to me then i'll be more blank than i've been in my life.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i sat next to becky during photography class because i didn't want to sit next to michelle. if i hadn't sat next to her she would have been all alone. i kept glancing at her computer screen and she was messaging alannah. i asked her if i could sit by her and she just kind of smiled, not really, and looked down a bit. she asked me how my break was and i asked her if she read my facebook note, which i had tagged her in. she said she only read about the first day but that she'd get around to the rest of it. i don't know how interested she'd be in it. she did like my status i had posted yesterday announcing the new note though.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm drinking in my room by myself again because i had originally planned to do my bullfighting research tonight but it's too late now and i think i might try to force myself to do it all during and between classes tomorrow. group mates will be seriously disappointed if i don't deliver. skipping homework for alcohol. huh.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
7-12; thursday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i met marie at the lobby this morning so i waited with her for sean and paco and eric joined us too and so i didn't go to mcdonald's for food today either. we separated at the subway station and i got off palau reial as usual, but i swear eric stayed behind on the train and i didn't see sean marie or paco anywhere either while i was walking up the hill. i was scared i was walking to the wrong place but i wasn't and when i got to the classroom they were all already there. i don't know what happened. a random also came up to me and seemed to be asking me directions for somewhere in broken english and i didn't know what he wanted. an undercover police guy came over and showed us his badge and asked for our ID. he asked me if the guy was giving me trouble, asked me what i was doing in barcelona, and led him away. weird encounter. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i smoked a cigarette during our lunch break time and surprised virtually everyone at the table. blew a breath of smoke into sean's face without thinking. urvashi walked by and was a little astonished. i was sure i wasn't smoking just to show everyone. sanat's comments made sure of that; he rambled about how i always ask him for a cigarette whenever he pulls his pack out and that i've been smoking for a while. it was the first time i lit one myself and wasn't sure how to do it. sean had to show me how to use the lighter and it took me a few tries.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>heather's birthday is today and she's only just turned 19. that young and she's been drinking for a while. i remember the time i took three sips from a bottle of her caramel vodka. what the fuck?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>becky sat next to me. probably unimportant.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i got a genuine ask sent to my tumblr by an anon. but i'm 90% sure it's cecili because i overheard her talking to perhaps tyler (they were sitting in the row behind me) about her reading &quot;dan's [mine] blog.&quot; i wish i hadn't heard that because then i'd have no idea who it is that asked me. the only person who i'm sure knows about my blog is urvashi. is it actually her? or did she tell someone? it might actually be urvashi after all. i spent the entire day under the impression that it was cecili. either way i have to get around to answering..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i want to pregame and go out to catwalk with people. it'll be for heather's birthday, but for me i just want to drink and club as much as i can before i leave spain.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today i also thought a little bit about the waiter at the french restaurant we ate at in munich quickly seeing that i don't talk a lot but then i also remembered that immediately after that he had said that i probably think a lot. one of the questions the anonymous ask in my tumblr has is why i don't talk much.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and finally lamenting that i formed no new bonds with people during our last trip. i hadn't really formed one with anyone during our first trip either, not even brooke, and i had only felt that way because we talked a relative lot while i was drunk. i like marie and sean but didn't even bond with them much. i'd made little effort talking to everyone while we were out and about but if hadn't i'd have been perfectly fine saying almost nothing to anyone for the whole week, i think.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>What is your biggest fear? What makes you happy? Do you think you have changed in Barcelona? If so, in what ways? You have so much to say in writing. How come you don't talk much?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm happy when people are comfortable enough to touch me. a friend told me once that you need 8 hugs a day to be happy but i don't know if that's true and i don't even get 8 hugs a year. i'll also be happy with a car, a long empty road, and a night sky with some stars and a moon. i don't think i've ever changed as much or as quickly as i have since coming to spain. i'm surrounded by types of people i've never ever socialized with in my whole life. up until now i've been friends with almost exclusively very conservative christian asian people who were starting to make me feel very stifled. so now i'm gladly taking opportunities here to do things, stupid things that i may or may not regret later but right now i don't care, i just want to experience everything. i'm most afraid right now of falling back into the person i used to be before coming here and losing touch with who i am now, once i start mixing with my asian friends again. i have to be so careful. gosh i feel like i could babble on and on if i could find someone who'd listen to me, but i guess my problem is my possibly flawed perception that nobody out there cares.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
7-13; friday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>confused about all that's happened tonight. i didn't go to a club. not opium, not catwalk. i walked back to onix with heather and ralf. we had hung out for a while with 4 girls on some stairs but i didn't talk to any of them except a little bit with one whose hand i held for a minute or two. she had a boyfriend though. didn't kiss anybody tonight either, which i badly wanted to do. talked about sex with ralf and becky. they've definitely had so much sex already. i want to have sex with someone. i want to make out. none of these desires are being fulfilled. they seem to keep reassuring me something will happen but i have little faith in the truth of that. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night was wrong. i stole the dryer from jessie newman. she had her clothes in one of the washers with a few minutes left but mine had been done for a while and i waited in the laundry room until the dryer was finished and i took the clothes out and put mine in. she never smiled or said hi to me. when i went back to get my clothes she had just taken my clothes and piled them on top of the dryer and said to me i just emptied it. it was okay.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>heather and rita hugged me when i went to eric's/sanat's room to pregame. rita was drunk. she didn't talk much. one of sanat's friends saw me and called me motherfucking asian guy. i took a tequila shot with him and heather and i gagged. i left for 15 minutes to get my clothes out of the dryer and when i got back heather and becky and a couple others were smoking in the room with the window open. sanat gave me another cigarette. brooke saw me holding it and told me she'd heard that i'd smoked a cigarette while sober. she recommended weed instead.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i smoked it on the way to the black sheep and left my bottle of malibu on the ground because i couldn't finish it. walked and talked with ralf. i just realized i'm not facebook friends with him. the club people were thinking of going to that night was opium, which i wouldn't be able to get into because i had shorts on. heather told me to link arms with her and maybe they would let me in that way. i brought it up later but she didn't hear me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the black sheep was boring. i sat next to heather and ralf and near becky and we talked about sex and how my first time shouldn't be with a random girl and that girls have it way better (becky nodded in agreement when ralf said girls have it way better). heather said i should try to talk to/hit on the girl in the dress who i saw in sanat's room but who i don't know. i later saw her making out with mike sandt.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i left the black sheep with ralf and heather to buy cigars at a gas station which didn't have cigarettes. they also bought a lighters and i think i lit one myself. i smoked two. we saw four girls sitting in the middle of some stairs and went down to join them and hung out with them for a while. i left them briefly to go back to the black sheep probably to use the bathroom, then rejoined the girls. they were all cute, i think. none of them really talked to me and i didn't talk to anyone. i don't remember what they were talking about. at some time we returned to the black sheep and found everybody gone. i held one of the girls' hands for a minute or two and she kept saying that i was drunk. i was. she had a boyfriend who came out of nowhere while i was still holding her hand. i remember letting go of it. i just smiled at him, whoever he was. eddy was in the room awake when i got back to my room at 3am. drunk, but still took a shower and then went to bed naked.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>marie sean paco and sierra were at the train station when i walked there, then reid. i tripped over my words while trying to describe why the night was confusing for me. marie was about to sit in one of the train's folding seats but a man ran up and grabbed her arm saying &quot;no no no no&quot; and then folded the seat all the way down to the floor to show us all that it was broken and half the people in the train car laughed. sierra stood apart from us during the train ride. no one tried to talk to her. on the metro she got off at palau reial and i was about to too but the rest of them stayed on and turns out they wanted to ride to zona universitat to take bus 54 that would go to the top of the hill. so that's what happened yesterday. i decided to sit down next to rita, who glanced at me but said nothing. then i sat down next to sam instead. i didn't go to the architecture site visit with anybody because i just wanted to come back to my room. dan fitzgerald said my name while on the metro and said tell me about berlin. i didn't want to talk to him and gave a very poorly detailed account of what happened when he said he didn't want to read my facebook note. i saw again that i was an asshole for not wanting to talk to him after realizing that anyone else would most likely have at least said things like it was fun it was beautiful. chip cely and vivi kreisel got off at sants estacio with me and the two of them talked, ignoring me even when i caught up to them on the escalator and said a hey that probably neither of them heard. i sulked behind them. vivi left for a different train and then chip and i talked and had an okay conversation from the renfe train all the way to onix 3rd floor. in my room eddy started talking to me, asking me what i did last night and we ended up talking for a long time in one of the longest conversations i've had since i don't know how long. i think realizing i was being an asshole to dan made me want to be less of an asshole to eddy. we talked about drinking and smoking (i basically told him i smoke now), traveling around europe, and movies. it was actually a pretty good conversation but i still don't want to go out to the soccer fields with everyone.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>also i remember yesterday afternoon heather and sanat related smoking experiences they had in middle school, and everyone talked about what they drank in high school. no shortage of surprises still. wherever the fuck they went to school, they had people smoking weed in middle school and drinking wine in high school and wth.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
7-14; saturday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i was sober enough to somehow find my way back to onix by myself. i guiltily label tonight as another disappointing night. apparently i kept grabbing rita's shoulder and sanat said i was creeping her out. i didn't mean it. i asked sanat why he wasn't creeping her out, because they kept on grinding and making out in front of me. he answered but i couldn't hear a thing he said. i kissed rita twice on the way to the club, but i don't want to count it as a kiss even though it's technically my first one. she and patrick were definitely making out for a short while in patrick's room's bathroom while we were pregaming. they went in there alone and excluded me there too. i guess that means their kissing doesn't mean much. david stolarsky and one of rita's friends were also making out in the flux pavilion room at razz. i was the only one who wasn't kissing anyone and so i left in disgust and disappointment. heather was obviously quite drunk and made out with i think chris stout a lot and danced with me but also whoever was near her, grabbing on to them and grinding and such. meaningless, it's all meaningless. ugh. smoked another cigarette and a cigar before going in the club too. i hate myself and tonight so much. ears are ringing. rita took her small white shirt off and was dancing provocatively probably in just her bra. short shorts too and her ass was in sanat's crotch and i kept staring at her even though i seriously didn't want to because i wasn't receiving anything and that was a big reason why i left. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now i started a facebook chat with becky, of all people. it's not going anywhere, unsurprisingly. why am i talking to her? i'm still drunk enough to be recklessly spilling everything to her. danger.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i had my arm stamped with something that could probably only be seen under the blacklight because i can't see anything on my arm now. not going back anyways.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i waited in line even though i had bought a ticket beforehand. probably wasted 2 euro doing that.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
7-15; sunday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>initially i had decided to screw going to tibidabo with ethan and the rest of the group who was going, but then ashley woke up and posted in the facebook group looking for people who were still here and wanted to go and ended up being her saving grace for the day. cecili joined us too and we went to eat, but then she said she needed to go talk to her parents or something, and went back to onix by herself so it was in fact just me and ashley hanging out for the day. i suspect cecili just didn't want to come with just us two. she was quieter than usual. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so ashley and i rode L1 to catalunya and then rode L7 to av. tibidabo and then took a tram up a long sloped street and then rode a funicular up the mountainside to the amusement park. the views were considerably better than those attained from montjuïc. we missed the L7 train and the first funicular because we were too slow and had to wait for the next one.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ashley likes talking about herself. she keeps going on and on and i have little to say, and little opportunity to interject when i did have something to say. kind of similar to lisa. when she's not talking we're sitting in silence.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>by this time it was well past 6 and chances of bumping into anyone from the first group vanished. i followed ashley mostly. we went on the roller coaster first and both took videos of the whole ride. i didn't scream. we went on a smaller slower ride which looped around the track twice. then we walked through a house of mirrors thing and what we thought were hallways were just mirrors a lot of the time and we kept thinking our reflections were other people until we'd almost walk into the mirror. i've never seen my reflection and thought it was someone else before. i felt detached from my reflection.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we didn't go on anymore rides but went up to the church at the top of the mountain, the sagrat cor. pictures and pictures of the view of the entire city far below us. we rode an elevator and then walked up stairs to the very top of the church, standing just below the statue of jesus at the top. i think a wedding was going on down below. could see the grid layout of the city streets, the torres agbar, the two tall skyscrapers we walk past when going to the beach, the sagrada familia jutting out above all the other buildings, the giant communications tower that stands in front of the church, the airport far off by the coast. ashley keep leaving and walking ahead without telling me. i wanted to get cotton candy but couldn't because i had to follow her.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the tram is no longer running by the time we rode the funicular back down. we walked down to the metro station, following the tram tracks. ashley told me about a fighter between sanat and heather last night in which sanat was the asshole. heather ended up going out because of him. i had been confused about her because tyler had told me last night while we were talking about pregaming that heather and brooke weren't going out, but heather was at razz matazz. i told ashley that sanat and rita were making out and she thought it gross. she would never be able  to do something like that to a good guy friend, she said. even attractive ones. i thought about &quot;friendzoning&quot; and didn't say anything.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we ate at &quot;jellyfish,&quot; the name everyone's been calling the chinese restaurant a block away from onix because they serve jellyfish. the last thing she said to me today is that she'd tell me if she was going to go out anywhere. she didn't. i learned tyler that a group of people were going to get shots before going to nit de montjuïc and another group would be going straight to montjuïc and that alannah was part of the former and to message her if i wanted shots.  i wanted shots but alannah wasn't online and neither was becky and at this point ashley had gone offline too, so i'm assuming she left with the shots group and didn't tell me. disappointing, or not disappointing because i wasn't expecting her to tell me anything.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i met tyler and the montjuïc group, which included reid and corrigan, dani, ethan, cecili, sam, michelle, and chris. cecili eagerly happily welcomed tyler and was immediately noticeably livelier than she was this afternoon. sam was drunk. michelle was being social and talking to us, in a noticeably forced and effortful way. sam suddenly got tired and michelle escorted him back while we were walking to the metro station. we stayed at montjuïc for less than an hour. the light beams were shining into the sky and boring music was playing. only dani, reid, and corrigan danced. chris was being sulky and quiet. i disliked it and made a mental to never act like that even when i'm feeling sad and antisocial with a group of people. his demeanor was simply enormously unappealing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i got churros at the churro stand in front of marina. ethan and i were in the elevator by ourselves for a thankfully brief moment.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>everything i want to do i want to do later, as if i need something, one last thing, before i can put the energy i supposedly have pent up inside me to final use. but that's wrong. for whatever reason i feel like i'm not ready to start doing, i've begun breaking down my goals into tiny, almost insignificant pieces that are quite simple to begin and try, and still i won't, i need just the right sheet of paper or a dark room or silence and some means of getting away from the city and time by myself and thoughts by myself and things i don't know how to..get..i read about spirituality today and it's hard and i have to start looking for it maybe i'll meditate. but i can't meditate here and that's wrong too and here we can see how i'm wrong exactly as i'm being wrong..i know i'm wrong about so many things but don't know how to fix them. although actually identifying is nonetheless progress, it's no use if i can't get work done..good work though, not wordily meaningless/ful work. i feel like &quot;but i don't know how to fix my problems&quot; is something everyone would say. does everyone know they have problems? i'm writhing in my possessions and mad desire to rid myself of all traces of them and all traces of myself i've left all over the place and i hope that that's something i won't need to do in order to..erase myself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>well i just went out for a walk in very very light rain. tried to buy a t-10 metro pass but it wouldn't work with the credit card. tried to find the mojito bar i went to on my first day in spain and didn't succeed. rita and her friend saw me as i was walking back. i asked them where they were coming from and they didn't answer probably because they didn't hear me. they didn't glance at me again while i walked further and further behind them. jellyfish had more people in it than last night when ashley and i went.</div>

<div>i called out &quot;sam&quot; when i saw sam at the train station. he was buying a ticket. melaena and caroline came while we were waiting for the train. eh. they didn't come to mcdonald's with us, where we saw corrigan. he got €8,05 of food. i downloaded 3 movies today in less than 3 hours. if i had known i'd be able to download this easily i'd have started earlier and gotten all of the ones in my queue onto my computer by now. a dean and a senior associate dean visited our class and we talked about our experiences in barcelona and we liked and didn't like. i ate 2 cheeseburgers on the way back home. david talked to me about the problem that we now share that is deciding between christian and non-christian friends. i feel disdain whenever he mentions god. i answered my 2 tumblr messages i received today. paradoxical sentiments hasn't replied to my reply and i don't know if she will. the other one who i thought was mo wasn't mo and i still don't know who (he) is. i ate with eddy at jellyfish. he was being rude-ish and took menus by himself and walked up to the waiter instead of waiting for them to come over (the waiter was being slow though). communicated with him in chinese for a little. we made it back to upc just in time. on the way a bunch of obnoxious kids ran in the train while one of the held the closing door open. they went in between cars and smoked pot. the smell was heavy in the train car and people stared but did nothing. i hated those kids. eddy asked me questions about girls in the cities i've gone and didn't seem to remember that we had already discussed this. all he talks about are girls and he talked to me about how to talk to girls after talking with/hitting on one at the subway station (she admittedly was very pretty though). he said that as long as the girl is smiling while i'm talking, i should keep going. i went with the architecture people to visit a contemporary art museum where we were given a tour by possibly sabir's boyfriend (i just learned yesterday from ashley that he's gay) who i could barely hear. people were falling asleep and tyler kept talking to anna. anna's cute. everybody dispersed after the stupid tour and i lost them. i stayed by patrick for a while but then he started talking with sabir so i was by myself. a group went to eat kebabs. i left by myself. i realized i like leaving but i wonder if that's what erdapfel means when she says she likes leaving. i walked past rita and the girl who's probably her sister because they look alike without looking at or talking to them and caught up with sanat and eddy. sanat stuck by me. if i didn't know better i'd say he just doesn't like eddy. t knew this was no attachment to me but i valued it anyway. he asked if i wanted to go to nasty monday (turns out no one's actually gone to nasty mondays even though a lot of people always talk about it) and i said i'd go we'd pregame in his room. bad idea probably, but i'm going through with it if i he hasn't forgotten about me. jessie newman is always reading her kindle.</div>

7-17; tuesday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>then last night i drank in total: </div>
<div>• a vodka red bull with a 250ml can of red bull and about 80ml vodka</div>
<div>• a can of coke mixed with about 80ml rum</div>
<div>• two somethings containing pineapple juice and vodka that tasted similar to a mojito</div>
<div>• a shot of something i thought was vodka but the guy i took it with insisted it was rum</div>
<div>• a jägerbomb</div>
<div>• a can of beer</div>
<div>i also smoked two hits of weed and 3 cigarettes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i threw up 3 times.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we had planned to go to nasty mondays, which still no one has gone to. not even us last night. there weren't enough people. we kept changing our minds and decided on ryan's multiple times. heather led us there. i was fairly tipsy while we were walking and was talking with ashley's friend marlin. he was friendly. it was me ashley marlin ryan sanat ralf heather brooke peter chris stout. i'm not sure if chris stout was at the bar with us. i saw brooke and peter leave early. the jägerbomb was a lot easier to drink than i was afraid it'd be. we stayed at the bar until it closed and then hung out in the square in front of the alley. i told ralf we're not facebook friends and he said that needed to be fixed. i'm not fixing it, and it still isn't fixed. i think he gave me all 3 of the cigarettes i smoked. i inhaled everything into my lungs this time. i peed on the street 3 times because everywhere was closed and there was nowhere to pee in. bought a pack of beer from a gypsy. i insisted that i couldn't drink a full can and got handed half a can twice so i effectively drank a little more than a can. i started feeling nauseous when we headed for onix and took a cab there. i had my eyes closed for most of the time. threw up twice in the onix hallway, once more in the bathroom. it was between 4-5am when i passed out totally in bed. woke up still quite drunk and feel like i'm getting drunker instead of sobering up.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>vivi kreisel friended me.</div>

7-18; wednesday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night i dreamt that i swallowed a sugar cube laced with acid. i was worried about a bad trip, but nothing happened and i just couldn't see straight. i've never actually taken acid. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>communication with eric peyton is irritating. he confuses the shit out of me. i feel like i can't care less about my classes right now, especially photography and tech comm. they'll both be effectively over by the end of the week. i have nearly 5000 words of essay to write for my other two.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>talking with kelly, especially online, is even more irritating. routine half-hour gaps between responses. yesterday she excitedly thanked me for liking her comment on her post to alex's wall about the bmw m3. who does that? such a fruitless, stupid conversation. she didn't even say anything about missing me, but then again she probably doesn't so at least she didn't claim to. didn't ask me about spain either. i really don't care but it's just what anyone else who hasn't talked to me in a while would do and i feel like the fact that she didn't says something about her. maybe i just want to say something about her.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>looking at and thinking for a moment about ashley made me realize that many of the people here i don't dislike, but am so incompatible with and cannot enjoy hanging out with them.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today's wednesday which means the cleaning ladies are going to come into my and eddy's room to clean our bathroom and make our beds. i want to leave a note thanking them. i don't know how tipping would work. today i organized my desk to be extra clean to exaggerate the difference between me and eddy. i have my toothbrush, shampoo, etc. on the shelf by my bed instead of in the bathroom. i'm hoping that way the cleaning people will know that it's eddy that's making the bathroom such a mess and not me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i watched watchmen last night, the 215 minute ultimate cut. there's nothing in it that made me cry but it got me really thinking deeply about cliche life issues and how ephemeral our world is. i almost came to the conclusion that god must exist. i think it's the closest to being my favorite movie.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i met sidney at the green line sants estació, and we had silent broken conversations during the walk to campus. i thought of so many smoother things to say in between words and chose to not say any of them. she talks so easily with other people..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>after my last class ended i walked apart from everyone else and saw sean and told him that i'm going back home by myself. he immediately earnestly insisted that i go with people. then he went to talk to chris julian, who i don't like, and i continued by myself. i passed ralf, sanat, and heather, who wanted to go out tonight again and were considering chupito's which i've never gone to before. i'm probably not going anywhere tonight.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
7-19; thursday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i just got back from ryan's, where i was sure to drink dramatically less than i did on monday night. i stayed in my room until i had written 756 words making up a third of my first architecture essay. didn't even get to pregame, which heather invited me to. alannah messaged me too, but only wanted to ask for the pictures i had taken of her and her friend. i met heather and sanat after taking the elevator to floor 5 to check if everyone had left yet. we all departed for ryan's and i saw marlon, who was surprised but seemed happy to see me. walked to ryan's, ordered a mojito they were only €2,50. i only had two sips of sangria and two mojitos and one shot tonight. tipsy now, nothing..big. i had eaten at tulip döner by myself after i couldn't get the guys there to realize i wanted to order out. didn't talk to anyone but marlon on the way there, talked to no one on the way back. mike rolled me a cigarette, which i smoked about two thirds of and didn't feel like finishing the rest. sanat correctly guessed that i had tossed it. i don't know if i couldn't handle it or if i simply didn't want it. mike was right; it did hit hard. i didn't feel sick or anything though. gagged upon not taking the shot quickly enough. asked dana about how being high felt like, and she couldn't describe it. she was surprised when she saw me smoking the cigarette. i want to get high, just to see how it feels once. dana said she's used to it. brooke and peter left the bar early, and i'm 99% sure they went to have sex. heather made a comment about it. so it's true. but i'm very uncertain that that would be something i want. but i don't have to worry because it's not going to happen with me. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it's been a long while since i last had a mojito.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm ready to give up on trying to interact with anyone here. marie stopped saying anything to me long ago. sometimes i even worry a little bit about accidentally doing or saying something that'll offend her and make her not like me. sean is nice but talking with him is just so hard for me, and he's not even someone difficult to talk to. i tried sticking with him and marie when we went to the museum today, but they left me behind. the mere sight of dan fitzgerald or michelle makes me annoyed. what's happening to me? how did i become this judgmental? i wanted to leave the museum by myself, but followed a group consisting of csukas, dana freeman, tyler, paco, and sanat. they were talking about penis piercings. i would have easily left them, but every time i think about breaking off, i get an image of one of other quiet people like dan or cecili walking by him/herself apart from a group. it makes me want to scoff. no one would like someone like that. so i stuck by them but they were talking about penis piercings. i had no desire to join in on a conversation about penis piercings. the conversation shifted to some other topic involving sex, and by that time i trailed behind them and left them.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>marie barely glances at me. she doesn't even lazily lift her hand to wave to me anymore.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>people are going to chupito's tonight, while heather had told me yesterday that we'd be going on friday. i'm not going anywhere. i'd rather tackle laundry and essays. i might go the entire trip without ever visiting chupito's. so be it, then.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>no more than 3 minutes after i wrote that last sentence heather messaged me and invited me out. the laundry can wait. but my essay. i'm about to make not the good decision.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
7-20; friday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>friday, july 20. tipsy again. didn't go to chupitos after all. too crowded. we were making too much noise, and the guys threatened to call the police i think. we went to a ryan's instead. a shot of tequila, a shot of vodka. a long island. enough to get me drunk, but not close to black out drunk. dani and tyler thought i was drunk while we were walking there, but i was 100% sure i wasn't. smoked a cigarette and a half. i talked a significant bit with dani and tyler when we left. eric was with us too. i didn't want to get too drunk so i left with them. so i went out tonight and got drunk, and didn't even go to chupitos. no essay work done tonight either. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this city is feeling less and less like home, the more i think about home back in america. i've progressed from ready to go home to i can't wait to go back. for a while i had been gratefully collapsing in my room after every train ride back, but i've never been more excited for a flight. i'm always more eager to leave than to arrive. i do like to leave.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>soon i'm going to forget completely the awful lonely foreignness that was spain's cruel greeting to me. i'm recalling my terror now, fondly. the surrounding neighborhood has become familiar. i have a map of it in my head. if you're standing within it i can tell you how to get from where to where. but i'm about to abandon this place. then i'm going to greet my car and we'll go out for an early morning 5am drive with music screaming from open windows and pick up some fast food.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>rewatched watchmen's opening credits sequence and i wanted to cry during the part where a girl puts a flower in the barrel of a soldier's gun but an instinctive urge to suppress all tears killed before i could think about crying. i watched the dark knight rises and thought anne hathaway was pretty. it was a nice concluding movie. now i'm debating whether i should go out to a medieval club, whatever that's like, or trying to finish more of my essay and laundry.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i feel less and less inclined to try to socialize with these people every day. ashley's tagged me in many photos by now. the ones from last night make me focus on the emptiness of this lifestyle. so stupid. what am i ever going to get out of this?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the watchmen frame with the flower girl i posted on tumblr got several likes and reblogs from people who neither follow me nor have me following them. i don't know how they even found it. jessie chiang commented on it on facebook, where i also posted it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
7-21; saturday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(500) days of summer is a beautiful movie. i kept thinking &quot;things like that just don't happen&quot; a lot when they were talking. i hope i'm wrong. i'll make myself wrong. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night as i was arriving at my room after getting chinese food eddy let michelle into the room right before i reached the door. she asked me if i was going out tonight, but i didn't even think to ask her if she was. i've never seen her at a club.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
7-22; sunday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it took me about 6 hours to write my final paper. i realized i basically analyzed my topic and then cited 3 instances where it applied, and didn't really argue for anything. well that only accounted for 10% of the paper grade anyway. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i was pacing around for moments while my roommate was gone i don't know where. i would have enjoyed the silent room but his laptop was on, fan on.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i was really glad i didn't go out on friday night, instead taking my time in my quiet room watching a nice movie eating chinese food i just bought myself. the same today. i enjoyed the clean sheets on my bed.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>two nights ago eddy, presumably, was knocking on the door when i was about to get in the shower. i ignored him. noticed his room key on the table after i got out. i had the sleep talk app on my phone running, and i was able to listen to him somehow make it inside a little past 6am without waking me up. hm.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
7-24; tuesday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hmm. tonight's timeline </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i ate at the pizza place across the street with ashley. heather, peter polack, an unknown guy, ralf, and marlon are also there.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we pregame in ralf's/peter's room. there are condoms lying about. apparently brooke and peter have sex in peter's bed even while ralf's in the room. i drink a fanta/vodka.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we walk to the black sheep. it's about 11:30pm. the rest of the group has been there for i'd guess at least 40 minutes by now. ralf and marlon finish their drinks outside and a sangria tower is too much for just me, heather, and ashley. we all get a shot, i get a shot of tequila. they're playing never have i ever. there is an unbelievable amount of sex involved in their never-have-i-evers. i have little doubt i'm the only person who has never had any sort of sexual encounter or experience. attempts at visualizing them all having sex fail. dana, elizabeth, and dani have all definitely been fucking. so have guys like reid and mike. i don't recognize one of the girls. vivi kreisel drinks during one turn because she's never made out with anybody during this trip. i'd have drunk too, if i had anything to drink.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a girl at the table next to us pokes my shoulder several times and waves. i smile and wave a little bit back. i didn't know what to do. if there was more space at their table, and if i was drunker, i might have joined them and tried talking to them. she was smiling quite broadly.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>while they all exit the bar, i get myself another tequila shot on my own. i'm planning to take a cab home by myself already.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the girl who waved at me is gone.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>outside i don't immediately see anyone and assume they all left without me but they're all loitering outside the alleyway.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i repeatedly bug ralf for a cigarette. i think he's drunk because he seems to keep forgetting within seconds. he and marlon continually talk nonsense about me being their bodyguard/cameraman while they go around walking up to people and asking them to listen to listen to one of ralf's new songs. it's his passage for his COA class.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i glance at vivi repeatedly.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i made the oh-so-wise decision to stay behind with ralf and marlon while they take every chance they get to approach girls and guys with the song. the rest of the group advances far ahead of us. ralf insists club apolo is very close by but not a single person we ask knows where it is.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the cigarette hits me like a freight train. i feel off balance, but not sick or dizzy. i make sure to not drink any beer that they keep buying off of gypsies.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ralf and marlon are drunk. i smoke a second cigarette. we pass a strip club, with a sign depicting a naked woman. it's €90 for entry. posters on the walls of more naked girls.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we make it to apolo and it's closed, no more entries. i didn't really care, since i hadn't been excited for nasty mondays anyway. i follow ralf and marlon a little bit before finally deciding to fuck them and take a cab to arc de triomf by myself. i have enough to cover the fare.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>once back in my room i find an angry message of ashley thanking me (and perhaps several other people she probably sent the same message to) for bailing on her. i had never noticed where she'd gone and assumed she was with the rest of the group. guess i'm not the only one who missed the last nasty mondays opportunity. she redirected her annoyance to marlon. good, as long as i had no fault in this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm wishing i had made more effort to communicate with that girl. whoever she was..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>chris romano and i just had a nice long conversation. at least that's how i see it. good thing i decided to go outside and sit next to him?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this morning:</div>
<div>conspicuously scared to draw too close to elizabeth and dana, who i had to follow into the train station. they knew i was there. another group conveniently on the subway, it stopped with them right in front of us. we say nothing..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>there were many bcn people on bus 54. mostly saying nothing to each other too. overheard caroline talking about her remaining metro ticket trips. i thought &quot;who the fuck cares.&quot;</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>she doesn't even look at me when we pass in the hall. fuck you.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
7-25; wednesday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i don't really remember everything that happened this morning anymore. i joined tyler, sean, marie, eric, and paco just after they left onix without saying anything to them at first. it's the last time we'll ride the train to upc. i slept through people's cs1 presentations during architecture. i looked behind me and saw ralf and marie sleeping too. ralf and i say words to each other for a minute in the cafe. everyone must have gone to the study room again because the computer lab was locked. i sat at the cafe by myself for a while. playing space ninja always puts me in a bad mood and a ballsy fly kept flying around my face. in photography people actually liked my photos of wings, more than i was hoping for. didn't win any prize this time though. left campus for the last time by myself. i went to withdraw cash and almost went back to look around the classroom one last time but didn't. everyone else was either too far ahead or behind me. i took the train back to onix for the last time. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>just got back with a group of delightful people after a journey to the top of the mountain parc güell. one of the highest points in the city, though i've actually been higher (to the top of the sagrat cor on tibidabo). this view was less obstructed though. we missed the sunset, and 8 of us went back downhill before it got too dark. dan fitzgerald, tyler, michelle, jessie newman, clay anderson, jay, john, me. we sang i'll make a man out of you and i actually joined in. sprinted downhill down a steeply sloped street. i felt like i was flying. none of us were even out of breath. i found myself talking to them more than i usually would bother, louder and more cheerful. even if much of it was quoting uncle dolan to tyler, who unlike sam doesn't know about it so it just makes him confused. all of the baseless animosity i've had towards michelle vanished. i had contemplated staying in tonight by myself but as always i'm glad i did otherwise. i wonder what i've missed all those other times i stayed in, if it was anything that could have been fruitful, memorable. pregaming in sean's room. i'm going to get drunk at ryan's tonight.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
7-26; thursday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>more sex never-have-i-evers with sean's girlfriend and presumably one of her friends. ethan made an audible announcement when never have i ever eaten a girl out was said; it made me look at him. marie, she has never kissed anyone, she said. some of us, maybe, are still tame. tyler stomped on a cockroach on the curb. i called him an asshole and said fuck you. i said i wouldn't have killed it, and that i don't kill spiders, but i do kill houseflies. i had erdapfel in mind and wasn't sure how i'd actually handle a cockroach if i found one in my house. half a bottle of malibu and one long island iced tea was all it took for me to black out for 99% of the night. i only spent €3. something started to smell very bad but i was already impaired and could barely detect it. we left before the bar closed. i don't remember anything in between leaving and onix again. i hugged urvashi, who we met coming down the stairs. she instantly knew i was drunk. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i want to buy a pack of cigarettes when i go back home.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
7-27; friday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>while i'm still drunk. 5 shots at ryan's, because we couldn't get into chupito's again. guess i'm never to chupito's on this entire trip. 5 shots and a long island. 1 vodka, 1 rum, which made me gag, and 3 tequila. i'm in love with tequila. got noticeably drunk after finishing my long island. people laughed at a few things i said. wondering how much of tonight i'm going to remember. i wanted to get another drink after my long island but everyone said no and they stopped serving so i didn't get any more to drink after that long island. good decision probably. i don't know how much i'm going to remember, but i hope i can for at least a good portion of it. i felt drunk after 2/3 of the long island. i hope i remember most of the walk back, but there's a possibility that i won't. rachel was decently drunk, i could tell. so was i. we touched a considerable bit. hugged and all. she went around putting her arm around and hugging everyone. i liked it. i told sean she's really funny. sean wasn't drunk though. we went to a small playground while going back. i got a little bit of sand in my shoe but it was okay. sam laughed at a lot of the things i said. i was drunk. many of us laughed at the things i said. i considered asking random people for a cigarette but wasn't enough just yet. i spun around on a thing that resembled a penis/fire hydrant and got really dizzy quite immediately. sean was completely sober. it was a good night though. didn't go to chupito's, but ryan's was just fine. friendly bartenders. everyone could tell i was drunk already because my face was red. i don't know what else happened tonight. i hope i remember a good amount of it. i remember recognizing the arc de trimof. talked a bit with sam. accidentally kicked tyler's elbow, i think. luckily i didn't hit him very hard. rachel was drunk, and spoke a little bit slowly and in a manner that strongly suggested she was drunk. sean was friendly. i apologized to him for something. of course i'm super happy that i decided to go out tonight. i left my bottle of cava at montjuïc. ralf offered me a cigarette there and i couldn't say no. it made me dizzy fast. michelle didn't drink anything. we were fighting over the last of kush's bloody mary, which i thought wasn't very bad. hoping i remember most of the night. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night began at montjuïc. a good number of us took the metro to espanya, including sam, sean, and rachel. i had a full, open bottle of cava with me. it was very conspicuous carrying that glass bottle on the train and probably wasn't allowed. heather had a bottle of wine, but hers wasn't opened. those of us who knew the songs they played at the fountain sang along. there was contemporary pop, there was opera. people posed in dramatic looking stances in front of the fountain. ralf offered me a cigarette. i blew smoke out of my mouth. i told sam i wouldn't be smoking anymore when i get back home. it made me lightheaded again, really fast, then went away when i finished it. dani and kush both tried to get people to lick their hands, it was a game they were playing. i licked dani's hand because she offered me a sip of her drink. she gave me a hug. we lost michelle in the crowd. i left my cava bottle on the ground, half full. split up on the way back to the metro station and waited for her. half of us went ahead. we didn't know which bar everyone was planning to go to so we went back to onix first. i walked to jellyfish with sam, cecili, and michelle. wasn't hungry, just wanted to speak to the waiters in chinese. i talked to the guy waiter, then the woman waitress came and beckoned us to sit down. i overheard her admonishing him about not ushering us to sit down. michelle isn't fluent in mandarin at all and when she speaks she has an american accent. the group waiting for us in front of us onix comprised everyone i loved. me, tyler, sam, sean, marie, eric, kush, cecili, rachel, and jackie. dani's blood sugar was low so she had to abort. rahul went to go get a sandwich and never came back. we walked to chupitos, where we couldn't get in again so we rerouted to ryan's again. i remembered how to get there this time. funny how it's the last night i have here that i remember where to go. i was eager for shots. rachel wanted vodka. rachel, eric, sam, and i got 5 vodka shots. then we got 5 tequila shots. then we got 5 rum shots. then we got 5 tequila shots again and this time i took two because i paid for 2, but sam had paid for my rum. ordered a long island. felt perfectly sober until 2/3 of way through it. rachel had been drunk for a while. i said &quot;sean and his girlfriend are 78% likely to make out within the next 5 minutes&quot; 3 times. i wanted to get another drink, but no one would let me. kush's bloody mary wasn't all too bad. michelle and i fought over the last bit of it just before we left the bar. the rest of my drunk night is up there.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i talked with rachel a little bit. she said she loves us all. i asked her for a hug and at first she said she didn't give them out like that and i was disappointed so i said i was disappointed and then she hugged me for a second. sean was sober and flanking our group and being quiet. i wanted to make sure he wasn't upset at anything. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today is our last day. i woke up this morning to my phone's tritone. it was the delta app reminding me to check in for my flight. in 24 hours, i thought, we'll be in the air, away from here. i'm so happy i went out last night. i don't even know what prompted me to change my mind again. the more time i willingly spend with everyone the more i end up loving them all, despite myself, and the more i'll end up missing them all, this city, the bar, the plane. and why's that such a bad thing? it isn’t.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>final hours in the city aren't even feeling final.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i woke up with wild hair that i thought looked a little bit like goku's hair so i took a picture of myself with it using photo booth and cropped out all of my face that was below my eyes and posted it on facebook where 20 people liked it. people liked it when i went down to the lobby too. ashley called out &quot;goku!&quot; and put her arms together in a way that emulated what goku does when he fires a kamehameha.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>tyler gave me his essay today, as he had promised last night.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the beach at badalona. a much quieter, calmer beach. i brought a blanket. the water wasn't too cold and we rushed in without second thoughts. the waves kept coming. it was so fun. they were biggish waves and i thought i could enjoy riding them, diving under them, and throwing myself into them forever and never come out. my eyes and nose burned. i wished i had brought my goggles, but the water was murky anyway.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sean was in jeans and didn't go in the water. his torso was super pale and white. i had no problem taking my shirt off and spraying myself with sunscreen. rachel was the only girl not in a bikini. i guess she just didn't have one. chris julian arrived with a small group later and was in jeans and sneakers. i didn't play football with them though. i eventually laid down and stared straight up at the sky and the sound of waves became muted. i didn't cover myself with sunscreen evenly enough and now i have some small patches of slight sunburn. went back into the water. rita pointed out the tan line around my neck. i peed in the ocean. my left arm became sore. i swam around with patrick, tyler, rahul, and some others. most of left but i stayed behind with john, tyler, eric, patrick, and rita. patrick and rita held hands while lying down in the sound. i laid on my back and stomach. fed pigeons crumbs, and tyler fed them cheetos. chip came by and shouted &quot;hell naw, hell naw!&quot; in a southern accent and i laughed at it for some minutes. i also laughed watching the pigeons twitching their heads trying to break the cheetos. we stood up at 6:26 pm and took the renfe train in the direction of l'hospitalet to onix. i still had cecili's ticket that she lent me, which i chose to not remind her that i had when she left. it was a satisfactory end day.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>patrick thought to hold a feast in his room in which everyone would bring all of their leftover food. we're going to be throwing a lot of food away. i brought him all of my leftover chinese food and got bored not talking to anyone and left, after buying a last kebab with tyler. he said he wished we could have gotten a picture with the guy. could that have been what he was asking me two days ago, about a camera?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i went to the tv room with john to watch the 2012 london olympic games, but got bored and left with sam. he said he had just gone for a final walk around the arc de triomf and i decided to do the same. i happened upon eric and michelle, and we walked together, past the arc, in the direction of chupitos, but we didn't turn onto the street to chupitos but i really wanted to walk along it and go to the small playground i was at last night while drunk. so i separated from them and went there for a minute and then turned around and headed back.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>then i watched a pigeon drown. i walked towards it and then it hopped right into a long pool of dirty water. it was probably confused and frightened because i was standing right there watching it. a couple were kissing on a bench behind me. the pigeon kept flapping its right wing and running into the wall. then it started floating on its side with its wing still struggling and could barely keep its head above the water, until it turned completely upside down. it turned on its side again and started coughing, it looked like, it kept opening its beak and it was clearly in agony. it threw up blood and then its head turned and it died and floated still in the water. i stared and forgot about it by the time i reached onix. i passed the group going out to a bar.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>packing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
7-28; saturday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it's 6:01pm est and no longer july 28 in barcelona. i got 2.5 hours of sleep from 4 to 6:30 in the morning. eddy loudly returned to our room at 6:12. i so, so gladly packed up my laptop and my last towel and scurried the fuck out of onix room 332. the buses were parked outside. people checking out. i left the cleaning of the kitchen to eddy. i also left my toothpaste behind because he didn't have any left and had been asking me for mine for the past couple days. maybe that was gross too, but oh well. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>while sitting on the bus i watched a man with a shopping cart, that probably held all that he had, sifting through the final bags of garbage we all dumped outside next to the container. i saw him go through the bag that i left. he opened a new bar of soap that i never used and smelled it. also saw him look through one of the blue envelopes containing all the welcome stuff that we got on our first day of school. the buses moved and the music on the radio was cheerful, but unfit for good-byes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my bags were quite small compared to everyone else's. they asked us useless &quot;security questions&quot; at check-in. i used the last of my euros at the airport's mcdonald's. bought a mug at a souvenir shop. watched olympic ping-pong and beach volleyball while waiting to board. we got here 2 hours early, but they passed remarkably quickly. eric chilling on the moving walkway, leaning against the rail. i decided buying duty-free alcohol wouldn't be a good idea. conversations. wrapped up our last ones in spain. boarded the plane. i sat next to elizabeth and adjacent to sam. the several rows of seats taken by  mostly everyone on our group flight made a lively section. i can't wait to get a kebab - ooohh. hey guys let's go to razz tonight - ooohh. i'm sure some among us teared up. and good for them. it means their lives changed.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i wished i had a window seat, because the wings on this plane were huge. engines going full throttle woke me up. i watched men in black, the shining, and the hunger games. the only song i listened to was &quot;little girl' by spiritualized. i'd made a list of all of the songs i've listened to since coming here and i'm wondering which ones will evoke my strongest memories of this place. i slept for maybe 2 hours. all of the window shades were down and it made me think that it was dark outside, but it was daylight the entire time because we were flying west. flying through the night is so much more exciting. elizabeth climbed over me every time she had to get in the aisle. anna and tyler sat to my 8. they gave us all a calzone and ice cream. how do they heat it all?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>our landing was smooth and met with applause. i stole the safety information card. my phone's status bar reads AT&amp;T again instead of yoigo/vodafone/movistar. reenabled data. 5 facebook updates in a row announcing our return. tyler likes calling me dolan. it was only a little bit weird seeing signs in and hearing announcements in english. i had hoped it'd feel weirder. it was also only a little bit weird seeing everyone GT barcelona in the hartsfield international terminal in america. pavan asked me out of the blue if i had another flight. i think he and elizabeth were talking about me. i don't know why. after customs and baggage claim everyone was inexplicably gone. i bid very few of us good-bye and hugged no one. the last people i saw were sam, tyler, sidney, and eric. i rode a shuttle to the domestic terminal with ethan.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sitting at the gate by myself now feels especially lonely. i keep looking around for my barcelona people, jumping whenever i see familiar-looking hair or hearing a familiar voice and still feeling disappointed every time even when i already know nobody is here. our relationships were born and bred in barcelona and will now have to grow in a not quite as exciting setting. the important thing is that we keep growing with each other though. i know a former self of mine that would have steadfastly rejected the possibility of building anything meaningful with the kinds of people i met here, and i'm confident that the summer has eradicated that version of me..i had new parts of my heart break open as well as new demons to deal with. it beats on, because we'll all see each other again. we've left spain, but not us by a long shot, and that makes me so happy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i've saved all of my train tickets/maps/boarding passes/club tickets/bar flyers/receipts. what creative thing should i do with them?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i still have to do my cs2 essay. my flight's been delayed by 100 minutes.</div>
<div><br/></div>

<div>
<hr/>
7-29; sunday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i want to think and write about how spain's changed me, but i just figured that if i do, it would be because i want to remember. remember how it has changed me, and that's not something that can be done by writing it down. perhaps that's just an excuse to not have to think about it and face the fear of not adequately covering every aspect i can think of, but that shouldn't matter. i guess i'll keep writing from day to day here, whatever goes through my mind that sticks. <br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
7-30; monday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking about home while away anywhere never feels strange but thinking now about being abroad feels surreal. just about the onix elevators and walking down the hall to my room and the buzzing the front door always made. wondering did any of it really happen? my house is suppressing my memories. i'm not thinking much about any of it. i feel like i'm on a different planet.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i should be watching more of the olympics. i used to love to. every time i watch the swimmers i feel pathetic at how weak my body is.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'd say the people i miss most so far are marie, sean, sam, tyler..that's only 4 people. i haven't talked to anyone since, either. sigh, i really hope our relationships get to continue this time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i think monique might have written a post about me. if it is indeed about me, then it's making me feel guilty. but i might just be convincing myself again.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
7-31; tuesday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i can never read poems. i'm not patient enough.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i think i'm about to go smartphone-less and ipod-less for the next few months. monetary..concerns..understandable. school life may become rather inconvenient. oh.</div>

7-6 n
<div><br/></div><div>Still on the quest to quell the anxiety-inducing panic I've been in perpetually since late April. When will I no longer remember this? I want to go back to recording my dreams. Everything that was new has become stale. It's a very quick process. I don't think this is a type of limbo anymore. I think this is reality.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
7-9 w</div><div><br/></div><div>Just whatever I find to be interesting, as I am still at an emotional standstill:</div><div><br/></div><div><ul><li>drove past Jessie (I think) earlier this week, never asked her about it. I'm sure she's in this country at the moment.</li><li>on Facebook it was announced, Ashley Rodriquez got engaged. So she's a patient zero of sorts. Thinking about her just glues me to the past again. How much do you she has moved on?</li><li>Pretty sure I heard worship music playing at some churches I drove by. ACF came back instantly.</li><li>It has been nearly one month. I can't predict what will happen to me if I keep going on like this.</li></ul><div><br/></div></div><div><hr/>
7-10 r</div><div><br/></div><div>I guess today was only relatively interesting. Some sad things occurred today. Two happened at Eats. When we got out of the car [the] Amber asked me if I ever talk. Then I relayed to her my car situation, which she had no interest in, which was easy to tell because of how talkative she is. When she and the other quiet dude whose head looks like a bean left to get Starbucks, Valerie and I sat next to each other and didn't say shit. It was painful and I ended up escaping, which is another bad sign. Mark, who resembles Anthony Ihnen, spoke on the phone with somebody and then [the] Amber pointed out that he was meek. I had made the same note in my head.</div><div><br/></div><div>Tom may be trying to help me (small degree) and David is being unresponsive. I'm not important to any of them. This is my own doing.</div><div><br/></div><div>Today [the] Toni randomly introduced me to another worker who I think is on a different team. I found him to be softspoken as well, and <strike>awkward</strike> that's not the best word, maybe this needs a new term. Even though he made me bend just like him, we actually talked for a while.</div><div><br/></div><div>All of these people have spouses/relationships. Literally so far, every one.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<!DOCTYPE en-note SYSTEM "http://xml.evernote.com/pub/enml2.dtd">

<en-note><div><b>7-9 s</b></div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s been one and half weeks since I moved, and I&apos;m now typing this desperately at 1 am on a sunday morning trying to record the thoughts I have left before they evaporate again. the past few weeks have felt like driving on a rocky dirt path covered in potholes and huge dents and puddles. I&apos;ve done quite a bit of work in the past week, though not everything is yet in its right place. I had more things than I would ever have estimated. my retail therapy has been at a ridiculous all-time high, the flux and flow of stuff overwhelming. it&apos;s been two years since I last felt this uncomfortable. feels like hell, I&apos;m so unaccustomed to it.</div><div><br/></div><div>I guess the office move to the third floor comes at an appropriate time as well.</div><div><br/></div><div>when I go back and look at the photos I took two years ago, everything happened in a shorter timespan than I remember.</div><div><br/></div><div>this should definitely be marking the end of a phase, bookmarked by explosions in the sky, but I don&apos;t feel any transition into a new one at all. my procrastination and stagnation if anything feel even worse. case in point: eleven days and I still haven&apos;t called comcast to cancel my service. eleven days!! I have too much inertia now, there&apos;s so much nothing weighing me down and making it ever more difficult for me to get up and move. it&apos;s horrible. I&apos;ve been itching to leave down and head home for a while, even though there&apos;s nothing there waiting for me either. and it would be at most for a measly two weeks. a paltry amount of time down here. and unbelievably, the same amount of time up there.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>7-26 t</b></div><div><br/></div><div>approaching four weeks/one month since the move out/in. this has been the beginning and end of a phase. it&apos;s crazy how wistfully I think of the past one year ago. summer and life is strange. although this is the point where things once again fell downhill.</div><div><br/></div><div>the Crazy phenomenon has been ongoing for at least half a year now. I had tried making a new playlist with all of his remaining amnesia videos but many of them are from too long ago. I would have had that playing on a loop instead of his trolling series, but that&apos;s what I still leave playing overnight. I wanted to terminate it after I moved in, but I couldn&apos;t even make that change. I&apos;m going to try again after returning from my next scheduled stop home.</div><div><br/></div><div>which has been seven months waiting, and is less than three weeks away. every reminder of how quickly time is passing drives me a little more insane. the length of the stop is shorter than the remaining time to it. how can I be looking forward to something that lasts so much shorter than the amount of time it takes to reach it? I get accustomed to cruising through life automatically and can&apos;t pull out of it during my time off. and it just passes, and goes, and keeps going. and I keep hoping for something to change. this will be the fourth stop home. I&apos;d like to make it a good trip.</div><div><br/></div><div>christian&apos;s handed me a few compliments during and after our workouts, about my chest muscle definition and vascularity in my arms.

<en-note><div>7-4 t</div><div><br/></div><div>today was the fourth of july and now is the fourth july since (including) 2014. I feel consistently apathetic towards any sort of celebration as usual. not appreciating home. just endless retail therapy. not appreciating what I buy. that I don&apos;t even get the chance to wear because I never go anywhere.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m feeling a pull but it&apos;s not strong enough to wrench me away. I have so many things that they have their own gravity instead. they&apos;re holding me here.</div><div><br/></div><div>there&apos;s no summer to me.</div><div><hr/><div>7-5 w</div></div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s just occurred to me that we&apos;ve passed the rough one-year mark since I &quot;officially&quot; moved out of the element. and all that it represented. one year ago I was sitting alone in my &apos;new&apos; messy apartment, rig disassembled, things scattered all over.</div><div><br/></div><div>a few days ago my parents wanted to have a day trip to the beach and I let myself get dragged to a foreign IHOP, a chain which gets less and less gratifying every time I visit, and then to a short walk and wasted opportunity along the shore. the area was lined with small houses and slow streets crammed with cars. people walking and biking. summer. I noticed a lot of small kids and a lot of old people, but not as many people my age as I&apos;d find in a place like atlanta, which makes sense, I thought to myself. we reached the path right by the sand that was close enough to the water so that I could see it and the horizon. I kind of wanted to go in, but I was wearing my adidas sneakers and socks and chino shorts. I didn&apos;t say anything.</div><div><br/></div><div>after this, another sleepless night, I only have two remaining until I leave this place and begin the second half of the year. I&apos;ve wasted most days lounging around the house trying to find a comfortable spot to browse on this laptop. I&apos;m going to regret not ever traveling, so much.</div><div><br/></div><div>constantly swinging to and from wanting a life filled with luxuries and a life not dependent on them.</div><div><br/></div><div>the only people I can consider my friends are v, ROdNEY, DOOGIE, and christian. somehow I ended up here, with three of them are around a decade older than me and v never present. DOOGIE again urged me to come back to the city this weekend, without citing a cause, and despite it being when I&apos;d be heading in the opposite direction.</div><div><br/></div><div>not appreciating my time anywhere.</div><div><br/></div><div>sometimes I feel like my incessant texts to v are like those novels that are written in the form of letters to a mystery nobody.</div><div><hr/></div><div>7-11 t</div><div><br/></div><div>the worst part of the trip is the last stretch beginning at the part that merges with 985. I almost feel sick when I turn back onto peachtree. it lasts shorter every time. two days in and this familiar environment has already reverted my habits and thoughts back to the way they&apos;ve been. it was still light out this time when I got back.</div><div><br/></div><div>if I&apos;m able to take another vacation this winter I think I&apos;ll focus on bringing less stuff still and simplifying the trip further. let myself feel a little freer to go somewhere instead of staying at home all the time. it&apos;s all that I want to do every time. wouldn&apos;t it be so much nicer to go places.</div><div><br/></div><div>last friday my parents tried to take us to walk along the beach again, and again I didn&apos;t want to go, becoming moody and stubborn when my mom kept trying to take pictures of me. stemming from my frustrations of being somewhere where memories are created, with no one to form experiences with. maybe that&apos;s why I avoid the outside.</div><div><br/></div><div>I had the on-site interview today and I wore the norse projects white oxford shirt. I don&apos;t think I made a good impression on them. the person I did the &quot;pair programming&quot; with reminded me of someone but I can&apos;t think of who.</div><div><br/></div><div>something relatively interested that happened today was a guy working at publix who bagged my Groceries, then told me I look like a gamer. like I&apos;d be good at a fighting game. I mentioned that I used to play smash bros. and we had a small conversation about it. he pushed my cart out into the parking lot all the way to my car and even helped me load them. it made me feel very awkward. I tried to imagine being friends with him and couldn&apos;t. wonder how I came across to him, a stranger.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>7-17 m</div><div><br/></div><div>I wore a shirt to work and bina came in just before I did. she noticed my shirt right away because for months I&apos;d been wearing a hoodie every single day. she told me she&apos;s not used to seeing me not in a &quot;light shirt.&quot; asked me how my vacation was and mentioned seeing wicked. she expressed interest in seeing &apos;hamilton&apos; together sometime. also noticed my &quot;new&quot; haircut unusually.</div><div><br/></div><div>today christian told me he ordered a few things from uniqlo after I&apos;d recommended the brand to him. I had a hard time understanding what he saying about it. he told me he&apos;d ordered some things, but also that they didn&apos;t have his size in some things. and something about the heattech items. the point is I didn&apos;t know what he was talking about.</div><div><br/></div><div>alice unexpected me asked me to hang out today. pretty sure she just wanted someone to smoke with. I haven&apos;t seen her since january. I didn&apos;t know about or ask too much for any updates to her situation. she works at at&amp;t, is living for the summer in a place across the street from where krish used to live. as soon as she got in my car I smelled her weed.</div><div><br/></div><div>she described her apartment as sketchy. it was messy inside, like a messy den. I took a few pictures but forgot to get one of the living room area. she&apos;d been watching lost, and I thought now would be an okay time to restart the series. she was in the middle of season 2 but I asked her to restart and she did. she wanted to smoke right away. I noticed the bong she had on the coffee table immediately, and it was one of those things that are larger in real life. she had a &apos;grinder&apos; so I got to see what that looked like. she taught me how to use the bong, something I did not know, and said she enjoyed teaching me these things. I felt like a little bitch for taking the time to drive over here for non-sexual company almost as soon as she had asked me to.</div><div><br/></div><div>I felt the high hit but it wasn&apos;t as strong as last time, even after she ground up some more and rolled a joint and I smoked that. lost interest in lost pretty quickly and didn&apos;t feel like watching anything else. she said she wanted to take a nap, and I already kind of didn&apos;t want to be there anymore.</div><div><br/></div><div>I kept expecting the altered state of mind to feel like drunkenness. time is still passing slowly...yet quickly.</div><div><br/></div><div>it wasn&apos;t really anything.</div><div><br/></div><div>she mentioned that she had a boyfriend, mentioning him as an afterthought (to me). whatever. we decided to order sarpino&apos;s, something I had in mind from the moment she mentioned ordering food. I paid with my card and she paid me back with venmo, something I think krish wanted me to get once but I&apos;d refused. I had to be careful not to get any sauce or oil on my shirt. for a brief moment as she was scrolling through the menu on her phone, I leaned in close to her face and imagined snuggling up against her. it was impossible.</div><div><br/></div><div>her roommate and her boyfriend (?) are asian and he looked more put together with me, with better hair and glasses. I feel this pressure in these ultra-rare moments where I&apos;m with real people.</div><div><br/></div><div>the entire time when I was with her, I felt like the DOOGIE of the situation.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>7-20 r</div><div><br/></div><div>lisa and I momentarily reconnected a couple days ago, on snapchat of all places. I don&apos;t know why she was bothered at all to ask me how I&apos;ve been and what I&apos;ve been doing. I also heard her voice again. it occurred to me that the last correspondence we&apos;d had was three july&apos;s ago.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>7-23 n</div><div><br/></div><div>there&apos;s an unremarkable, small story behind the first snapchat I ever received. it&apos;s become nice to be included in as small a way as this.</div><div><br/></div><div>christian&apos;s &apos;communication&apos; continues to suck. I make it no secret that I simply follow what he does when he&apos;s there, and he always lets me go first. then waits until I finish a set to ask me how many reps I did. to point out a difference between the weights on either side. then masking it as intentional. I don&apos;t believe it.</div><div><br/></div><div>I don&apos;t remember if he told me it&apos;d be this coming week or a later week that he&apos;d moving over to a different building, in tech square, and so I won&apos;t be able to ride with him to the CRC anymore. well we all knew it had to end at some point. this is a fine way to start.</div><div><br/></div><div>it was quite unbelievable when I came to the realization that more time has passed between now and when I first met up with alice two summers ago, than between then and 2014. the same with DOOGIE.</div><div><br/></div><div>and finally, the ps4 was sold this weekend.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>7-26 w</div><div><br/></div><div>dismantle the distractions and I find that there aren&apos;t any. there&apos;s no reason to not start anything. this is just procrastination on a grand scale. I finally scheduled a dentist and a doctor&apos;s appointment for myself. it only took me three years.</div><div><br/></div><div>who knows where I&apos;ll be by the end of this year.</div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday I was in-game with DOOGIE, Sir Boolean, and Tracy, and DOOGIE&apos;s out-of-proportion rage towards the game ended up driving Tracy away. perhaps Sir Boolean had been feeling similarly, but if he did he never spoke up, and I myself, while I have in the past, have mostly given up on it as well. but it felt good. Tracy and I ended up having a conversation deriding DOOGIE&apos;s unreasonable antics, and it was rather cathartic for me.</div><div><br/></div><div>turns out christian&apos;s move to the tech square building is temporary; if he told me this earlier, I didn&apos;t hear it. I drove us to jalisco for lunch yesterday, and he asked again about lunch today. I took the stinger up to tech square and we ate at gyro bros. he distinctly addressed me by my name. I felt terribly insecure, around him, out in the open, in my mismatched clothing. we didn&apos;t talk much as we ate. I did a lot of staring and not-responding. we were eating outside, so the background noise drowned out a lot of what he saying and I couldn&apos;t hear much of it. I know he mentioned the uniqlo airism t-shirts that I&apos;d recommended him. he ordered some and they arrived but were too small. we likely won&apos;t be going back to the crc for around a solid month. I smell a lot of laziness ahead of me. the crc will be closed for three weeks, and I don&apos;t see myself looking for alternatives. maybe this will give my neck a chance to get better. it&apos;s been awfully sore for some reason.</div><div><br/></div><div>after lunch, as we were waiting by the trolley stop, matt ward happened to walk by. I said a pathetically weak, &quot;hey&quot; which somehow still managed to get his attention, and opened up the possibility for &quot;lunch sometime.&quot; I was distinctly aware that christian was watching our interaction. later that afternoon I emailed matt ward and he asked for my resume to give to his supervisor.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>7-30 n</div><div><br/></div><div>upset. every year keeps getting worse. I have nothing else to blame and can only conclude that I don&apos;t really have what it takes on my own. just wasting day after day on a worthless existence.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m alone to the point where I&apos;m both too good and shit at being alone. there&apos;s nothing good about it when it&apos;s 100% of my time. when the only people I get interaction with aren&apos;t helpful to me. I tremble when I look at my pile of wasted time that&apos;s so high I can&apos;t comprehend it yet. my words have become a mess. I&apos;m full of the same ones but they pour out of me like shit.</div><div><br/></div><div>I spent this weekend playing the same youtube video on repeat, forming a poisonous, imaginary relationship with a person who isn&apos;t there, who I haven&apos;t met. I keep doing this to myself. the fantasies are fuel for the depression.</div><div><br/></div><div>after learning the news of apple discontinuing the ipods, I went ahead and ordered an ipod shuffle so I&apos;d have one. then today I went to the apple store so I could get my hands on one without having to wait for it to arrive. it felt strange to be outside on a weekend in the middle of the day. a cute girl working at the store asked if she could help me, as I was holding it in my hands, looking at it. I&apos;d love to twist my interaction with her in my favor, but that&apos;s the same familiar fool&apos;s errand. I hadn&apos;t bothered making my hair look nice. I didn&apos;t stammer, but my words were unclear. I mentioned something about apple discontinuing the ipods, but I&apos;m not sure she understood me. I liked her glasses, but couldn&apos;t bring myself to tell her. I thought I didn&apos;t look nice enough. I couldn&apos;t stop thinking about her for a long time.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">7-1 n</span></div><div><br/></div><div>I found it noteworthy that Cody basically just blurted out that I had a &quot;panic attack&quot; that time I went over to his friend&apos;s place. Barb seemingly empathized, but I couldn&apos;t tell if it meant anything. she called David a hot mess who&apos;s probably desperate because he isn&apos;t getting any. so that&apos;s out of the ordinary? I can&apos;t picture of us regularly getting any. are they all? Barb? Cody? Dorothy?</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">7-2 m</span></div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday Barb had texted Cody and me inviting us up to her house to watch another movie, and I waited for Cody to answer because I didn&apos;t want to end up alone with her watching some movie. as soon as he said he couldn&apos;t come, she closed the plans, as expected.</div><div><br/></div><div>Hannah invited me to another poolside cookout. I&apos;m tired of hanging out with her and her friends whom I don&apos;t know.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">7-3 t</span></div><div><br/></div><div>it was just me and Jay and at the expo today. we&apos;re not close friends, but that&apos;s okay. the uber driver that brought me there was hell-bent on making sure I knew exactly how to get to building c of the gwcc. I lost count of how many times he told me the same things. the lady I showed my driver&apos;s license to to pick up my bib told me I have a nice picture. I jokingly asked if she said that to everyone and she said she didn&apos;t. I wandered around all the booths with Jay, signing my name on a big banner thing that was covered in signatures. there wasn&apos;t anything interesting going on or anything worth buying, so when we reached the end we just left. Jay was wondering if we could hang out with Hannah after the race, which was surprising. I&apos;m planning on seeing Dorothy, Heather, and Barb at least for dinner tonight again.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>it feels wrong to simply end the day without saying anything about tomorrow. I&apos;m running the peachtree road race tomorrow. hopefully I&apos;ll be able to get there okay. the group will be fractured across all the waves. there are barbecues and parties planned for afterwards. it&apos;s going to be a very different 4th of july.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">7-4 w</span></div><div><br/></div><div>I experienced both good and mis- fortune today. luck was on my side when the third uber I tried was dedicated enough to repeatedly call me, find me walking along a different street, *and* reroute my destination. so I got dropped off fairly close to the race&apos;s start line. so a miracle saved me from a significantly late start. I was still too late for my start wave, but Barb was already waiting there and she even managed to find a bib. so I was able to begin the race with her. although I lost her at a water station at around the second mile. I proceed without her and ran down the street along all the sections I&apos;m so used to driving down regularly. sadly it was only slightly surreal to see the entire road entirely filled with a teeming sea of people. since we were among the last to begin running, Barb and I were the last ones to cross the finish line. surely enough I sprinted across.</div><div><br/></div><div>I didn&apos;t get a t-shirt because I thought I&apos;d have to pay for them and they wouldn&apos;t let go back to grab one. we meet up with Dorothy et al. by trader joe&apos;s on monroe. then split with Dorothy after taking a few group photos. the rest of us hiked to the midtown marta station, where Cody and I split from the rest as the only ones who didn&apos;t take a train. I ended up accompanying Cody and his friends Bi (?) and Ryan, two people who I&apos;d last meet in march, for lunch at a restaurant called homegrown. I felt okay.</div><div><br/></div><div>they dropped me off afterwards and Peachtree was no longer blocked off. it felt wistful to see the street back to normal, when I had been running down it with thousands of people hours earlier.</div><div><br/></div><div>I turned down Hannah&apos;s invite to another one of her pool parties, because I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d have a good time with all of her friends who I don&apos;t know. instead I played L4D2 with &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE for three and a half hours, then bought some raspberry sour beer from kroger before heading to Dorothy&apos;s. there, everyone made some homes about me skipping sections of the race this morning because my race results weren&apos;t showing up. this is the misfortune section, that I can&apos;t find out what my time is. I wasn&apos;t amused, because I was genuinely upset that I couldn&apos;t see my time. based on estimates though, it was second only to Jay. Barb had a relatively fast time too, and I finished before her.</div><div><br/></div><div>so we went out to the pool again and got to meet Barb&apos;s Mac, the guy she had mentioned she&apos;d been seeing recently. there&apos;d been some discussion about what the deal between these two is, but I don&apos;t want to concern myself with any of it. Dorothy said that in one of our group photos, Barb had positioned herself next to Cody, which I noticed, but what I didn&apos;t notice was her standing close against him. even though I was the one who had run with her this morning. it sucks that it still sings a bit, even when I&apos;ve already known that there is nothing and there never was.</div><div><br/></div><div>we have been back inside for a while now and are clustered around Dorothy&apos;s dining table, the conversation turning towards convincing Dorothy to smoke the weed I brought.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">7-5 r</span></div><div><br/></div><div>after sending some emails back and forth, it seems that I might still be able to get an official race time by applying Barb&apos;s start time to me. apparently the issue was that my bib didn&apos;t read at the start line. I posted in the messenger group about it and Dorothy made another joke. it really annoyed me that they weren&apos;t taking me seriously.</div><div><br/></div><div>last night I eventually didn&apos;t want to smoke anymore either because it was getting too late. Barb left with her Mac and we remainders began talking about her again. apparently she and the Mac were getting touchy-feely when they were alone in the kitchen. they wondered why Barb would continue behaving so flirtatiously towards Cody if she&apos;s kind of seeing Mac already. I made some quips that made people laugh, so that I would feel okay. I&apos;m so glad I&apos;m not terribly jealous, or I would have felt doomed again. I let slip that, last weekend at Cody&apos;s, I had intentionally waited for Cody to sit on the couch next to her first before moving to the couch myself. given her desires in her relationships, I might not exactly be missing out on anything anyway. even if she did display her tendencies towards me, it might not mean much.</div><div><br/></div><div>ever wonder what it is about Barb and David that leads the group to gossip about them in particular (in addition to the Ben) so much? we keep coming full circle about them over and over again. should I be more worried than I currently am about what they might be saying about me behind my back? I have to agree with them, though, David does sound like a confused mess right now. maybe he keeps posting all those photos in the messenger group for validation. wouldn&apos;t that be something.</div><div><br/></div><div>I have to keep my jealousy of Cody at bay by reminding myself that none of the others owe me their attention.</div><div>today some of us at work had lunch at wagaya, upon my suggestion. they liked it. so far, Blessed&apos;s antics have consistently fallen on the good side of my fragile mood.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>now that I&apos;ve gotten my official time sorted out, I don&apos;t feel like updating any of the others on it. it&apos;s 1:03:14, about 8 minutes faster than Cody and only about 2 minutes ahead of Barb. I feel like they don&apos;t truly care for me. I&apos;m not in such a position in that group.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">7-10 t</span></div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s impossible to pay attention. summer has really snuck up on me. it never started, it just always was.</div><div><br/></div><div>if I had been able to go home for two weeks like I have the past three years, that stay would have ended last weekend. the time is just over.</div><div><br/></div><div>I realized that I forgot to wish my dad a happy birthday on sunday. that may have been why he asked to &quot;catch up&quot; on my work. somehow I&apos;m still unsure of the date every year.</div><div><br/></div><div>the Gorm is here again, without warning (to me). caught off guard again. despite constantly feeling incompetent and underperforming, I feel that he&apos;s alright with me. cracking a joke here and there. as unpleasant as working with this codebase is, every time I&apos;m eventually able to figure out the cause of an issue the dopamine or whatever it is washes over me. and for a while everything is okay, and I think, maybe I can stay here after all.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">7-11 w</span></div><div><br/></div><div>Hannah is hosting: yet another pool party. And all of us in the running group are invited. No word yet on whether any members from her other circles will be there. Everyone was quick to respond, mostly yes. Dorothy, wants to try pot beforehand. Yet again.</div><div><br/></div><div>I’m not sure what to make of the Gorm’s habit of walking up behind or next to me by my computer and just standing there. Is he checking on me to make sure I’m working? Or has my aura somehow trained him to do this?</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">7-15 n</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>having just come to the realize that we&apos;re in the middle of summer not long ago, I now realize that there might not be much of it left. a month, a month and a half? how much can one do in that amount of time?</div><div><br/></div><div>planning on using the remaining tycho album as the soundtrack for the next phase.</div><div><br/></div><div>today felt fast. because I woke up late after staying up late last night, and spent most of the day at Hannah&apos;s pool gathering. which I feel like I can&apos;t remember very much of, because I can&apos;t keep my mind present while I&apos;m there. anxiety still blocks too much.</div><div><br/></div><div>I was only the third person there. Hannah was waiting in her building&apos;s club room with her friend Jeff. she didn&apos;t give me a hug when she met me at the lobby. I keep thinking maybe it&apos;s because my language somehow suggests that I&apos;m not open to one. I had once again bought too many hot dogs. I think not even one pack was eaten. the music blaring from Hannah&apos;s bluetooth speaker was uncomfortably loud. four people trickled in after me: Jay, a &quot;Joacin&quot; (sp?), Dorothy, and David. Jay tried showing me a few memes on his phone, that I hadn&apos;t heard of before. Hannah pushed several times to get us to play one of the many board games she had brought. but only three people sat at the table we moved the games to, and I was with the other three at the table with the food. we ate Dorothy&apos;s chip dip. Dorothy did most of her talking with David. I noticed that Jay didn&apos;t say much as he stood by (I didn&apos;t say much either). when Dorothy mentioned Tia&apos;s roommate being quiet last night, I said that I sometimes fall silent too when I&apos;m around people I&apos;m not familiar with. it&apos;s nothing to Dorothy.</div><div><br/></div><div>David leaves early to attend to another obligation. after about an hour or so we gathered everything, no board games having been played, and went up to Hannah&apos;s unit to drop some of it off. it was the first time that the others in our run group had seen her apartment, and they were wowed. Hannah talked to Dorothy about how she had bought it with her ex, etc. she was talking slightly fast and seemed excited to share. she mentioned her John again too, but I didn&apos;t ask her anything about that. the Jeff and Joacin were sitting next to each other on the couch. I saw the Joacin scroll through bumble.</div><div><br/></div><div>we changed into our swim suits to head down to the pool. Hannah&apos;s face and upper chest/back were red and splotchy from drinking. the adidas slides I had bought a few days ago were excruciatingly uncomfortable. I accompanied the rest of them and entered her pool area for the second time. after a few minutes of each of us waiting for someone else to enter the pool first, I got in the water with the goggles I&apos;d brought after Hannah and the Joacin. apparently Joacin is taking swim lessons. Hannah and I have to be the best swimmers. Heather showed up. eventually Dorothy entered the water too. she&apos;s only comfortable doing her pseudo-backstroke because that&apos;s the only way she can breathe. I swam from one end of the pool the other underwater to show off.</div><div><br/></div><div>the rest of the time I spent basically doing nothing. Hannah left temporarily to meet with a &quot;sales rep&quot; or something in the lobby. Tia arrived and stayed for a short while. she&apos;s another one of the members who I just don&apos;t feel natural talking to. a girl arrived, a Christa (sp?), who looked slightly familiar and who seemed to know the Joacin and Jeff. I liked her style aesthetic but I didn&apos;t say that to her when we briefly talked when I went to get my slides near where she was sitting. she also remembered me from somewhere but neither of us could recall where we last saw each other. Jay went back to his phone and I tried to not resort to scrolling on mine. Dorothy suggested getting bubble tea at sweet hut, but changed her mind with Heather to an ethiopian restaurant, and I wasn&apos;t interested in that. after a situation with the security guard where we were detained for having glass bottles on our table, we headed back to Hannah&apos;s room. there&apos;d been some conflict about it ongoing already. apparently, someone reported us to the security guard&apos;s boss so he had no choice but to keep us held? and Hannah could potentially be fined $1,000. I didn&apos;t say anything even though I felt bad and wanted to do something, if I could, to help. Dorothy and I talked briefly while standing outside on the balcony. she wanted to have a party at my place, which I&apos;m open to. this sort of thing was mere fantasy not long ago. when she and Heather left with Jay, I decided to bail with them. Hannah didn&apos;t hug me on the way out. why would she?</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">7-18 w</span></div><div><br/></div><div>this morning Zach missed another meeting and I learned that the Ketul is leaving the company? at the end of this month. another departure.</div><div><br/></div><div>I somehow keep forgetting to record details of Dorothy&apos;s &quot;potluck&quot;, as she&apos;s fond of calling it, that finally happened and during which she finally actually tried smoking. it began again in Dorothy&apos;s kitchen, where everyone kept talking about the usual shit. Dorothy made the cocktail that Barb&apos;s Mac had introduced her to last time. I forgot to drink any of it. I had four slices of pizza, taking the last plain slice. the party migrated to the pool quickly enough. the pool lights were out so it was dark. Cody started another fire. he&apos;s pretty good at it. he suggested to me that Barb would likely begin spending less time with us while she&apos;s seeing her guy. and to expect her to begin showing up again whenever whatever that is is over.</div><div><br/></div><div>Jay tried to get us all to play a game called &quot;game of things.&quot; in it, you take turns, getting 10-15 seconds to name five things that would fit into a given category. I think no one was particularly interested because they kept turning their attention elsewhere. I knew I was anxious about not being able to say enough funny things, and I have an inkling that the others felt the same way (but I could be wrong). it got dropped quickly enough.</div><div><br/></div><div>I can&apos;t remember what lead up to this, but Dorothy said that I have a creative mind. I think this was when she brought up my nonsensical facebook statuses that I post occasionally. how interesting that I apparently come across as someone who&apos;s &quot;creative&quot;. she had given me control of her speaker and I played courtney barnett and various snippets from my previous eras, that none of the others could know anything about. David&apos;s ears perked up when I picked a chase atlantic song from february/march. and again when I picked lights&apos; &apos;new fears&apos;.</div><div><br/></div><div>we end up breaking out the weed right there by the pool, where we were the only ones left. David looked to me like he didn&apos;t approve of the activity much. or could he possibly have felt intimidated? Jay was excited for it too, but neither he nor any of the rest of us (save for Cody) had much experience grinding and packing a bowl. it was simple enough for me to figure out, with some of Cody&apos;s help. I kept asking Jay if he knew how to do it, looking for someone else to take over. I couldn&apos;t help myself, it seems, and I need to stop that. I &quot;cherried&quot; the bowl and, with Cody, helped Dorothy take her first few hits. she had totally been sheltered. after a few minutes she felt the high hit, and her speech slowed and she became relaxed in her seat. Jay and I kept looking at each other and laughing. I found myself having to force my laughter a bit. I felt just a little high and focused on the falling sensation that happened every time I closed my eyes and rolled my head. at some time, Hannah messaged me asking if she could come over, but later changed her mind.</div><div><br/></div><div>we retreated back indoors, where we ate some dessert. Tia and her roommate left while I was in the bathroom; they probably didn&apos;t even notice I was away. Cody seemed to be a combination of tired and slightly high, and curled up on the living room floor. Dorothy kept commenting about spooning, and hadn&apos;t heard of &quot;jetpacking&quot; before Jay brought it up. she loved it too much. David takes control of the speaker and plays a song from of monsters and men, which I&apos;m sure he first heard when I played it during the camping trip in march. we sat around the living room and Dorothy wanted to smoke some more, but every time she brought it up nothing happened. I think we were all waiting for someone else to mention it again. eventually I tore up some more and packed the bowl again, and we smoked a bit inside Dorothy&apos;s living room. David actually took a hit too, and Dorothy said he knew what he was doing. but he either forgot or didn&apos;t know to cover the carb as he was inhaling, I couldn&apos;t tell which.</div><div><br/></div><div>soon, Jay, Cody, and David all trickled out, and I ended up being the last to leave. Dorothy was only talking to Heather as I got up and cleaned the bubbler. she almost never even looked at me, and I&apos;m starting to doubt that she realizes how little attention I get compared to the others. I don&apos;t know if she&apos;s doing it on purpose, or what she truly thinks of me. we did a weird three-way hug just before Heather and I left.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>christian messaged me today, informing me that he should be fit to return to the gym soon. I&apos;d forgotten that his car accident had put him out of commission. I decided to mention to him that I&apos;m considering finding a new job, and he suggested I apply back at gtri.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">7-21 s</span></div><div><br/></div><div>a storm hit this morning as I woke up for the run so I went back to bed and fell asleep to rain and thunder for the first time in I don&apos;t know how long.</div><div><br/></div><div>later, I went to piedmont park on my own after texting cody that I was going, and ran again with my shirt off because it was hot enough outside. as I was walking out of the park after I finished, one of the bums on the bench called out to me, calling me baby, saying he was gay and making a noise that sounded like a catcall, although whether it was to me or his buddies next to him I couldn&apos;t tell.</div><div><br/></div><div>I found cody stretching by my car right as I turned onto that street, and he explained to me again that he always showers before leaving the house, even if it&apos;s to run where he&apos;ll just get sweaty. because he feels grimy when he gets out of bed. he went on a short run and met me at jason&apos;s deli before I finished my croissant sandwich. there he brought up David again, specifically his increased activity on social media. maybe he&apos;s thirsty for that validation. it just so happens that I&apos;d noticed David&apos;s posts on instagram, at least six or seven in a row, the one time yesterday when I was actually browsing my feed. I myself noticed that they seemed contrived, pictures of him in the middle of a workout routine. cody said he definitely took a video of himself and posted screenshots. and then the usual pictures of food and random snippets he&apos;s always sharing. there&apos;s the feeling again. cody and I spent the rest of them discussing the failures in the new star wars movies.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>Claire just posted in the message group that she&apos;s joining us for dinner tonight. this shouldn&apos;t have caused my anxiety to spike a bit, but it did.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">7-22 n</span></div><div><br/></div><div>sundays continue to be &quot;depressing&quot;.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;ve been feeling somewhat stifled. like I have no one to talk to despite having a small circle of friends now. some days I can keep up with the coworkers&apos; banter. on other days their words form an immovable wall.</div><div><br/></div><div>while I was on the way to hello chicken, nita messaged me. I hadn&apos;t heard from her for over a month. she&apos;d gone to &quot;watch puppetry&quot; with the asian meetup group, and said it was so much fun meeting them again. a very nita thing to say. half the sky was sunny and the other half was covered by large storm clouds that just completely blanketed the sky. I saw lightning flash all around me, I had never seen anything like that before. little did I know that hello chicken was literally right next to the mozart cafe. I arrived at the same time as cody.</div><div><br/></div><div>inside I found Hannah with the jiu-jitsu Steven. I saw the two motorcycle helmets behind them and thought that they rode here together, but she&apos;d actually come by herself. she forgot that the Steven and I already knew each other. I wasn&apos;t expecting her to bring any extra people. when in fact she invited her coworker Joacim as well, Tia brought a friend, and Dorothy brought one of her coworkers too. Tia&apos;s friend had a certain kind of sterotypical asian face shape, I thought. I paid attention to my mental state and noticed that I felt mostly good. relaxed. non-anxious. no pressure. Claire arrived, in a black dress and black platform slipper things. I thought she looked nice but didn&apos;t really say a word to her all night. the Joacim was wearing a graphic tee with an elaborate skull print that looked like something mcqueen would put out, jeans with random things printed all over them, and clean new-looking converse sneakers.</div><div><br/></div><div>Cody and I decided to order a plate of chicken just to share between us two while the rest of the group split some much larger combos. the chicken we got was somewhat disappointing, because the chunks weren&apos;t very meaty. I could barely the spiciness, and Dorothy pointed out that my lips were swollen. when I went to the bathroom I saw that they were indeed huge and kind of purple. it was mildly horrifying to see myself looking like that. I was sweating buckets and trying to downplay how much it was affecting me. did the others really think I was handling it okay?</div><div><br/></div><div>we briefly loitered outside the restaurant, which reminded me of ACF. I finally got to see one of Hannah&apos;s bikes, see her in her jacket and helmet, see her riding off. it was impressive and intimidating. Tia&apos;s friend, who I didn&apos;t think much of, turned out to have a dodge challenger. I&apos;d like to think I&apos;m a little more in tune with my emotions by now. I felt the perceived inadequacy and the urge to catch up, and I know the best thing to do is to ignore them.</div><div><br/></div><div>at Dorothy&apos;s, I was torn between bringing my own toolbox in along with Cody&apos;s and David&apos;s, or just letting it be. which one would be less ridiculous? I ended up bringing mine in and for some reason it got some unexpected attention. everyone pointed out how shiny and new it was, but it was just an ordinary thing to me. before we got to work on her closet hooks, we latched onto a new gossip victim: the Jennifer, Dorothy&apos;s coworker whom Dorothy wasn&apos;t expecting to actually show up to the restaurant. there was a long discussion on how people are treated in the service industry, and the Jennifer was cast in a negative light because she had been somewhat stingy, and probably didn&apos;t realize that the reason the service wasn&apos;t the best was because there were only two servers working.</div><div><br/></div><div>so I did take the backseat, mostly watching David and cody do the drilling in Dorothy&apos;s closet. they did make some use of a few things I brought. I thought David in particular was slightly overcomplicating the process, insisting that he drill into a wall stud, which required drilling a new hole into the new hooks that Dorothy had brought. part of me thinks he just wanted to show off, although there&apos;s no way to tell if he legitimately did believe his lengths were necessary. Dorothy and some of the other girls popped in occasionally to see how it was going. she finds it hot when men are handy and fix things. since I didn&apos;t contribute much physical labor, I said some funny things instead. Tia pointed out my deadpan tone at least twice, so she notices that.</div><div><br/></div><div>Barb showed up afterwards, and by around midnight Hannah and the Joacim were here too. Hannah had added him to the running group. her willingness to blend her friend groups together and her quickness with which she establishes friendships annoys me. I know it&apos;s because I feel threatened.</div><div><br/></div><div>after David left with Tia and half the group dove into another gossip-driven discussion about him, this time including Hannah. Dorothy relayed to her and Claire the same stories about him that I feel I&apos;ve heard countless times at this point. questioning his motivations again, loneliness resurfaced and Hannah said that she&apos;s been feeling so after being single for a month. we are entire worlds apart.</div><div><br/></div><div>while we were talking about religion, I fell into the hole and kept trying to wait for people to notice me. please stop trying this, because it doesn&apos;t work. it&apos;s just a weak thing to do that only begets more negative emotions.</div><div><br/></div><div>interestingly, Hannah went against Dorothy and Claire with regards to Claire&apos;s term &quot;choreplay&quot;. she admits she&apos;d rather be submissive and likes it when a man tells her to do something. I guess she gets turned off by men doing certain chores? either this or something else we talked about ties in with the Ben. yes, we touched on him yet again, spilling his personal details to Hannah, who didn&apos;t know most of them. so she thought that he seemed weird, and we all agreed that he&apos;s a beta. this is all real.</div><div><br/></div><div>the topic shifted to something that I think David had initially brought up before he left, &quot;what was the weirdest place you&apos;ve ever done it?&quot; which was a terrifying, exciting question. Barb seemed excited to answer, and multiple people wanted to know Cody&apos;s answer. he had a few stories to tell, and I think he liked the attention. if all the girls were giving me that same attention, I&apos;d like it too. Dorothy and Heather provided their answers, so I know that even they&apos;ve had the experience, too. I still don&apos;t know how the cabin that is my mental space didn&apos;t implode from the pressure, but I felt okay. I wasn&apos;t burning to disclose my status. Claire and Hannah didn&apos;t give any specific anecdotes, but I know they&apos;re both inside, too. I had a response ready just in case the spotlight landed on me, but of course it never did.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">7-23 m</span></div><div><br/></div><div>today is the beginning of the Gorm&apos;s second three-week vacation this year. the Ketul is supposed to have only a week left. I have no idea how things will move forward from here. I&apos;ve been kind of hoping a string of laxer days might help spur me back to jiu-jitsu, but I&apos;m beginning to think there&apos;s a chance that I&apos;ll never go back there.</div><div><br/></div><div>sadly, I&apos;m starting to find petunia a little bit too strange for me.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">7-24 t</span></div><div><br/></div><div>the Gorm certainly trusts the Blessed to run things while he&apos;s gone. I have a suspicion that he told Blessed to make sure I&apos;m doing work. Ketul&apos;s messages on slack kind of remind me of my dad.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>today, after some six weeks or so, I finally went back to the jiu jitsu gym. Hannah&apos;s bike was parked outside. Jacob noted that I hadn&apos;t been there in a while. the smells&apos; familiarity hit me. Hannah gave me an oddly friendly-looking smile. the rolling wasn&apos;t as unfulfilling as it oftentimes was, but it wasn&apos;t rewarding either. I told them I&apos;d be back on thursday.</div><div><br/></div><div>&lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE asked me how I&apos;m feeling. I mentioned jiu-jitsu to him for the first time since I started it. maybe he sensed that I felt bad yesterday, or pretended to, based on my behavior.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">7-26 r</span></div><div><br/></div><div>interestingly, I may have tapped someone out at jiu-jitsu today, the Jang. it was while I had back control on him, and Jacob said &quot;nice&quot; after I gained it. granted, I wasn&apos;t even trying to choke him out, and I think neither of us knew what to do. it&apos;s entirely possible he tapped just to reset. but it was legitimate, it would be my first.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">7-27 f</span></div><div><br/></div><div>last night I had a comforting dream, the rare kind where I feel so completely content. in it I was making out with Barb. it wasn&apos;t anything in particular about her, it just happened to be her that my subconscious picked. I thought it was really happening. kissing someone for the first time. our lips were wet. the dream also involved my dad somehow obtaining a bag of pink &quot;ecstasy&quot; capsules. I chew and swallow one or two and start seeing strange colors and shadows. it only lasts a minute or so. I eat a few more but nothing happens, and keep trying until I get the effect again.</div><div><br/></div><div>Anthony explicitly mentioned to me that next thursday the company plan is to go out somewhere for drinks because some people who&apos;d been using our office space are leaving? one woman, the spanish one, is going back to spain. and apparently Richard wants to go &quot;back&quot; to the cheetah lounge.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">7-28 s</span></div><div><br/></div><div>cody finished his run just after I went off with the rest of group towards jason&apos;s deli. the Ben was there, and this time I noticed his fireman shirt that Dorothy&apos;s mentioned. we sat outside, next to the girl in the group Brittany, and the black guy who I&apos;ve seen a couple times here. cody must have brought up my lego millenium falcon, and I ended up showing them all the pictures I&apos;d taken while I was still building it. I could tell that the black dude was feeling left out, but he spoke up while the Brittany and cody were scrolling through the photo album before I could preemptively show him myself after they were done. he was shy and friendly, and I&apos;m no stranger to his position. I noticed that it did feel good to be receiving this attention, even it was just about a lego set.</div><div><br/></div><div>the Phil at jiu-jitsu is one of the friendlier ones even though he doesn&apos;t speak much, which is why I don&apos;t really have any issues rolling with him at this point, despite not being able to overpower him. Jacob gave me a small bit of feedback today. Hannah showed up on her other bike.</div><div><br/></div><div>for some reason Dorothy and Barb are in florida or somewhere? so we won&apos;t be doing any &quot;birthday stuff&quot; with Jay, or hanging out elsewhere. relying on this group will not be enough, because the semi-regular saturday hangouts we&apos;ve been doing are all I have right now. cody texted me saying he&apos;s bored because there&apos;s never anything to do after running in the morning, but he&apos;d rather do his paintings. I&apos;m not involved in that at all so it&apos;s nothing to me.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>7-30 m</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>when I got back home from the run on saturday, a woman and her daughter and her daughter&apos;s friend? were standing outside the garage gate with their car&apos;s hood up, and she asked me for help with a jump-start. I agreed to help them but was nervous because I didn&apos;t know how; the last time I had to have my own car jumped, the person I&apos;d asked did it for me. after I got out and opened my hood, they stared at me, expecting me to know what to do. it was embarrassing that I didn&apos;t, and I had to look up instructions on my phone while the two teenage girls with her did the same. in the end I/we got it working and she told me her name and shook my hand. I could tell, as I turned to the other two girls, that they weren&apos;t sure if I was about to shake their hands too. I didn&apos;t.</div><div><br/></div><div>this morning Zach finally joined the dev-standup call for the first time in like two weeks. but he was several minutes late, and Blessed ended the call without giving him the chance to speak, because he joined late. Zach had been absent from the calls for so long that I was beginning to wonder if the Gorm had told him not to join them anymore or something.</div><div><br/></div><div>my parents are scheduled to arrive for their visit tomorrow. I dimly recall thinking, a couple weeks ago, about how their stay was still a couple weeks away. now, after seemingly no time has passed, the time is suddenly here. I&apos;m looking forward to parts of it but not eagerly anticipating the habit disruptions.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<hr/>
6-10; sunday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>friday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm finishing up our ethics paper with cely and eller in their room. cely goes downstairs to work on another paper of his, eller chats with his other friends and i throw together a weak conclusion to our stupid paper. heather makes a post in the gt barcelona facebook group announcing a trip to chupito's followed by ryan's. i want to go but can't because of photography class in the morning.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in the morning i go to photography class. i see eller, gillespie, and a girl but i don't remember who the girl is (she may be caroline). the train ride and walk up the school hill progress in silence.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we spend 3 hours scrolling through about 70 photos taken mostly around barcelona. some of the manipulations were impressive and i wouldn't have guessed that some of us were as skilled with image editing as they apparently were. i mentally rehearse the descriptions i'm going to say out loud when we reach a picture that i took. i wonder if julian thinks about how stupid i am while i'm talking about my pictures, especially when i mention the instagram filter. the first photo of mine shown is the one i took of the empty subway station, which several people had comments on. the only comment i remember clearly is by urvashi, who said the blue overtone made her think of air conditioning while subway stations are actually typically hot and humid. 11 people liked it on facebook and it won me a prize: an old photo portrait of a woman printed on i don't know what. nobody really had anything to say about my second photo.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>martin and fitzgerald are planning to leave for the airport at 3pm. i walk briskly ahead of everybody else back to onix and shove clothes into my backpack, which becomes bulky but not very heavy unless i wear it for extended periods of time. i skype mom. i go downstairs to meet martin and fitzgerald, who are packing a lot more than i did. i go outside to throw some trash away and see urvashi outside and i talk down about ahuja and fitzgerald with her and her friend. peyton emerges from the lobby; he is on his way to the airport too and i invite him to join me and martin and fitzgerald. it turns out we're on the same flight. we also go with two other girls who are on a different flight to israel (we're all going to paris).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i almost immediately wish that i had packed everything into a small roller bag instead of a backpack, which is already making my back sweaty.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we take a train to the airport and i'm able to stare outside the window and not see tunnel walls for the first time in a long time. i try to cherish it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we get off the train to the airport and in the crowd we spot vacovsky and she joins our party. she's on our flight too.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the airport is very quiet and not crowded. vacovsky and i throw our water bottles away. airport security is a complete breeze, except for fitzgerald because he brought so much stuff that he had to all shove back into his pockets and he had so much that it took him several minutes. vacovsky briefly sympathizes with me when i mention ahuja is a my roommate. he frustrates her to no end. he wasted his parents' money on plane tickets to a flight he isn't going on. he's the most disrespectful and inconsiderate person we've ever met.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the airport gates are quite minimalist and very clean. there were no visible boundaries between them. the entire terminal was one giant continuous area. sanat, reid, and corrigan join us. i talk a little bit with vacovsky and start falling in love with everybody.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the flight gate information doesn't even appear until shortly before boarding. things are taken slowly and relaxedly here. the flight is one of the shortest i've ever been on but i only slept through half an hour of it. after we land reid and corrigan leave, vacovsky says &quot;crêpes crêpes crêpes crêpes&quot; excitedly, and the rest of us are split between different hostels. we find our way to trains that will take us out of the airport, but fitzgerald is hesitant and martin, he, and i are separated from the rest of the group but we all promise to meet up somehow later. we take the next train and wait for what i think  is an RER line. a train, presumably the one everybody else had boarded, leaves just as we make it to the platform and we have to wait well over an hour for the next one because of a strike that's apparently happening. we use the hour for some awkward bonding time. i underestimated how cold it would be here. i can't keep up with any of the french and regret not learning the language any further beyond middle school. i try to pronounce the names of all the stations with a perfect french accent. gare du nord.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we wait an extra half hour after fitzgerald hesitates again to get on a train that will take us to within walking distance of our hostel, which doesn't have a shower curtain. rain begins to shower on us and for that moment while we're running i was thankful that i had only a backpack on me. the hostel is easy to find and we check in. martin and i leave shortly to look for food at the mcdonald's, but it and all nearby food places are all closed. it's before midnight.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today was host to the worst travel experience i have ever had and i try to not ask why it happened to us nor think about how smooth it could have been without fitzgerald's hesitance. tomorrow will be better. ~</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>saturday:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it's actually sunday now and it's 3:30am and it's simply too late for me to write down everything we did today because that would take me at least another half hour. the significant parts shouldn't leave my memory before tomorrow night though. we're going to visit the louvre.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>saturday morning started at 9:30. we went to the mcdonald's for breakfast. we didn't know french or what any of the breakfast menu items were so we just had to point to whatever was already sitting there and kept saying &quot;l'eau&quot; for water. i got 6 macaroons with martin. they were sweeter than i thought they'd be.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>fitzgerald walks and jogs ahead of us all the time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at the train station he asks a french woman who can speak english which train to take to notre dame but he kept pronouncing it the American way and she didn't understand until i pronounced it the french way and then she instantly understood. we got to notre dame and i laid eyes on the cathedral. there was a man standing still holding a piece of bread, it looked like, in his outstretched arm and tons of little birds were fluttering up trying to hover and get a piece of the bread. he took a little girl's arm and taught her how to do it. she looked happy. we walked inside and i felt pretty much the same way i always feel when visiting a giant church. i thought about how cavernous and  insanely intricate everything was, looked at some stained glass and candles, wondered how much of the architecture actually remained unmodified, and then i wanted to leave. but fitzgerald wished to attend mass so we waited for him while a church guy in white robes spoke french. the seating area was very empty and not even the first few rows were filled.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we walked in the direction of the eiffel tower and stopped to eat a restaurant where i tried escargot for the first time. they smelled great, were covered in a garlic sauce, and tasted like a salty mushroom (slightly squishier than real mushrooms). martin called sanat and reported that they were all at the eiffel tower. we took a train and walked around a little park that gave us a gorgeous unobstructed view of the tower. we walked toward and then under it where we then met up with vacovsky and the others, felt like magic. not the tower though, we didn't stay at it for long enough for the fact that we were standing at one of the world's most iconic places ever to sink in. they were planning to go to the biggest flea market in paris so it was off to the metro for all of us and then walking straight north with fitzgerald asking everybody for directions with his translator until we find the market. it's massive but we stroll through much of it. i wasn't looking for anything to buy but was ready to spend on anything that jumped out at me but nothing did. i got a crêpe at a cute little stand being run by a nice french guy who had probably been making these crêpes for who knows how long. out of fear of impending rain we leave more than half of the market unexplored and head back to our separate hostels save for me and fitzgerald and martin who go to rodriguez's. she falls asleep and we walk around the block. fitzgerald wakes her up and we go to a market where i buy a bag of sour gummy worms and eat the whole thing. fitzgerald buys biscuits and apples and cheese and is interested in getting back to our hostel as soon as he can. plans are made to regroup with vacovsky and co. and find an obscure authentic restaurant for dinner that we can indulge euros on. we do just that an walk into a tiny little local place where we all have a huge dinner and i take a panorama shot of everybody with my phone.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my favorite moments are when everyone is eating in silence. i feel a sense of camaraderie that so rarely wraps its arms around me. i know it's going to be only fleeting but i revel in it while i can.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm going to cherish that night. i knew i would well before dinner. i'm not anticipating many of them to remember me, but walking and talking and, in my mind, bonding with a small group made of people i haven't talked to in barcelona easily made that day one of the best i can remember and was certainly the most fun i've had in europe so far. we had planned to find a bar but ended up staying out too late eating and didn't get to go anywhere else.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the train that goes to the stop closest to our hostel isn't running so fitzgerald asks a person who leads us to a bus driver standing outside his bus talking with two cops and i think he diverts from his usual route to help us get back. it was very nice. ~</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sunday:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>far less eventful. we oversleep and don't make it to the louvre until 3pm. i'm not even subconsciously on the lookout for vacovsky or peyton while i'm walking around with martin stealing his camera to take pictures with. he has some nice DSLR and i revel in the aperture/shutter speed/iso settings. we take over 300 pictures today. i still have a map of the louvre in my pocket. it's as exciting as i expected it to be. slightly above metropolitan museum of art exciting. we lose fitzgerald. (he had to use the bathroom badly but there were lines for all the bathrooms and he politely asked the people in line if he can cut in front. as he went an old man in front of me turned to me, gestured to fitzgerald in the stall, and said something like &quot;he's got no prostate.&quot; i started laughing. he turned to fitzgerald as he exited the stall and said &quot;you've got no prostate&quot; but he didn't hear him and said thank you. i laughed while i peed.)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>text on the back of our ticket says the museum rooms will begin to close at 17:30 which only leaves us 2 hours. we barely even make use of that time and leave before anything seems to start closing because fitzgerald is certainly at notre dame for mass again by now. it's beginning to drizzle and it's windy and cold and i'm still in shorts and a thin shirt. today's mass is much more crowded and almost two hours and i stand and sit down sometimes when everyone is singing. people are still walking around taking pictures. i don't know what the person leading it is called but he keeps waving incense through the place that slowly floats forward towards us. i can smell it. everything is in french and i don't bother reading most of the passages. i look up psalm 115 but can't follow the french.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it starts raining harder when the mass is over and we try looking for a doner kebab place martin and i had passed but can't find it and walk into a little japanese restaurant instead whose food i didn't like very much. fitzgerald then takes off back to the hostel to retire for the rest of the day. it's about 9pm now. i never stop to think about how a lonely and meaningless a trip it must be.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>martin calls the others to ask them about their plans. i worry to myself that if he hadn't initiated contact, they wouldn't have bothered getting in touch with us.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we meet with cavosky and sanat and peyton again (we got fined €30 each after the metro ride because we had simply walked through inoperative turnstiles) and we make a visit to the arc de triomphe. night's completely fallen and the arc is very not crowded and the lift to the top isn't working. i eventually learn that reid and corrigan are also visiting and we meet with them and take a train to the same park that i was at yesterday. we successfully catch the eiffel tower sparkling for 5 minutes after midnight, after which martin and i leave the group because we have to catch trains back to our stupidly booked inconveniently located hostel before they stop running. i had just mentioned crêpes to vacovsky and was hoping to eat one tonight. they're probably at reid's/corrigan's apartment now drinking. i wish i could be with them. i would love to have gotten drunk in paris. fitzgerald has been seriously inconveniencing us. obstructing our schedules with all the masses he absolutely must attend, forcing us to cut visits short to wait for him. booking a hostel in the worst place ever, way off the grid and not even in paris. that's what i and martin get for not booking it ourselves, i say to myself and the others over and over again. we discuss how socially inept fitzgerald is again while walking back.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i never want to walk back here again. tomorrow morning we'll check out of here and eat a big breakfast somewhere, hopefully with crêpes, while fitzgerald has fun at another mass. the afternoon will be short because we have a plane to rome to catch, where we'll be able to rejoin vacovsky, sanat, and peyton and this time do whatever the fuck we want. the weather should be nicer too. ~</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>monday:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i didn't do anything today except walk around a lot and eat two crêpes. one with ham egg and too much cheese and the other with nutella and banana. i asked for orange juice in french. we had to follow him to mass again. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we walked back and forth past a homeless woman who only had €0,05 in her cup the one time i dared to look. i was afraid that she hated us because she might've recognized us from walking past her so many times. i guess if i really wanted to help i would have given her some change, even though fitzgerald was with us and i'm always thinking about when he told me he never gives money to the homeless. at one point there was a black ferrari 458 italia parked about 30 feet up the street from her. it was ironic.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we also went up to the top of the arc de triomphe today. i took pictures of the city with martin's camera again and took a photo of the railing before and after so i would know which pictures were mine. only martin and i were able to go because fitzgerald offered to stay on the ground to watch our luggage (they had rollie wheelie bags and weren't allowed to go up with them). i'm at the airport now and we'll be on a plane to rome in half an hour. i plan to listen to music and try to sleep through the flying.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a man sits down in the aisle seat next to fitzgerald and they start talking. he's gay and an atheist. fitzgerald begins explaining his faith to him and they talk throughout the entire flight.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we arrived around shortly before midnight and everywhere is empty. it was a little unsettling. the train that would take us to roma termini train station was almost completely empty and i couldn't see out the windows to look at the stations it stopped at. it was a short walk to our hostel this time but the streets were quiet and not many people were walking. most places were closed. i don't know why it caught me off guard so much. i was never aware of being used to a city that wasn't so quiet at night. our hostel room has 3 separate beds, more reliable internet, and shared bathrooms that don't provide shampoo or soap. they also didn't have towels. i didn't want to think about how dirty my clothes are. my feet smell awful.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>tuesday:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i wake up really early and keep going back to sleep and waking up again while having weird dreams.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we wake up late and the weather is warm and not windy. fitzgerald sprints ahead of us to a nearby market where we eat a cheap breakfast of bread and cheese and ham. he eats an entire block of some kind of cheese with his bread. is eating that much cheese at once unhealthy?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>he runs off to mass somewhere while martin and i take a train to the colosseum. it's right outside the station which i didn't expect. the temperature is really rising now and the entire area is swarming with tourists. i feel almost no urge to take pictures of anything. we only walk around one side of the building before leaving. several people approach us with tour offers. there are so many more tourists here than there were in paris, which surprised me because i had just learned that paris is the most traveled place by international tourist arrivals and paris didn't feel touristy at all.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the entire city feels old. all the buildings are old, nothing looks modern, and the traffic is awful. it somehow feels more crowded than paris did. i find almost nothing interesting. i buy a nectarine at a fruit stand.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>martin and i walk towards a plaza where he's planning to meet some tech friends of his and we see them and i stand there while he hugs and talks to several girls. male pidgeons everywhere are trying to mate. we walk across the river and back and i eat some gelato. i think i'm going to get a lot of it while i'm here. back at the plaza where fitzgerald is supposed to meet us but he doesn't come because he's looking for mass times at different churches. a group of german people sit down by us and i see a pretty german girl. i decide that i want to make out with a cute german girl. i take random pictures.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>after that we walk down a long street to a different plaza where the group of students that martin's friends are part of are giving presentations on the buildings and things there. there are a lot of different clothing and jewelry shops and little markets and food places but we don't walk inside any of them. they give their presentations, one girl leads us inside a church and talks about it. we crowd around a painting depicting st. peter's crucifixion and i want to stare at it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>martin's girl friends discuss plans involving pub crawls and i want to join them maybe tomorrow night. i'm starting to not care about meeting up with sanat, vacovsky, rodriguez, and peyton, but there's a possibility we'll see each other tonight.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i think my clothes make me stand out a lot and i'm feeling a desire to visit style blogs and learn how to dress more fancily like a european.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm hungry now and realize how little i've been eating while traveling. i've eaten nothing today except bread cheese ham and some gelato.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>wednesday:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night was great. i walked to a plaza with people eating at restaurants and standing in the center playing music. a woman made giant bubbles that kids chased after. she left presumably when she ran out of bubble solution but i didn't see her leave. an old man sat in a chair surrounded by cool paintings of his with a generator to power a little light to shine on them. the area felt very italian. i wished i had a camera with me. two of tyler's friends came but only one walked with us to an irish pub where the others were. a eurocup soccer game was being shown on 8 tv screens overhead. we went to a different bar called the drunken ship after everyone finished their drinks. one of the bartenders had a very raspy voice and spoke mandarin but he wasn't asian. i kind of had a short conversation with him but wish i had talked to him for a little longer. he gave me a long island for one euro less than their normal price. i started losing my balance afterwards and spilled a drink on brooke's camera. i vaguely remember her casually remarking that she'll need to put it in rice. i desperately want to apologize. we went to a hookah bar and everyone smoked it except for me because i was deemed too drunk already. i really wanted to smoke it. i had my arm around brooke the whole way back and i told her i love her. woke up in the morning still slightly drunk.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>went with martin and fitzgerald to st. peter's basilica in vatican city. it was huge. i tried praying halfheartedly. we attended the pope's general audience while i was feeling tired and kept falling asleep while he was speaking.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>rome is old. i said that i'd rather live in paris because it's a denser city, but rome actually is much more crowded. i think what i meant was simply that paris is more modern. all of the architecture here is old and the streets are cobblestone and bumpy and make my feet hurt faster when walking. homeless people sit at the foot of stairs in the train stations. it's sad-looking.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i wish i could learn every language and all of their intricacies. pronunciation and literature intricacies. i wish i could be there at the time the language first developed. how old are french and italian? i see little kids speaking foreign languages and think that they must have no idea how lucky they are to be able to speak perfectly fluently. i want to comprehend languages.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
6-14; thursday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday we went to the pantheon. there were protestors camping in tents outside and police officers standing nearby. it didn't feel large and empty and quiet like it looks like it's supposed to be. there were too many people. we left after a few minutes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>that night martin and i go out again and meet brooke &amp; co. at piazza navona. i make sure the first thing i ask her is if her camera is okay. it's completely fine. she tells me she laughed at the facebook message i sent last night in our thread. i sent &quot;what the hell happened&quot; because i remember so little of the walk home. i remind her that i also said that i love her. she says she's meeting with sorority sisters so she might not drink. i feel a twinge of disappointment and realize that that's a bad thing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>one of martin's friends meets and greets us and we get up and go back to the drunken ship where we order a pitcher of vodka/red bull and another pitcher of irish sex on the beach. i give brooke €2 for last night's pitcher and she appears reluctant but takes it. i feel tipsy already after the second pitcher but remain conscious enough to stop drinking so i'm able to remember most of tonight. she mentions how &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;chill&quot; i am when i'm drunk and talkative. quiet people always have something to say when they do say something, she says. &quot;glad you came&quot; by the wanted. she and sanat go take self pictures of themselves with random people and i join them because i want to follow her. martin and rodriguez say they want to leave because they're bored and i have to go back with martin so i have to leave too. we hug.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hailed a taxi back to termini and ashley smokes a cigarette and i smoke it too, three times. martin and i have a conversation about cigarette addiction while we walk back. fitzgerald sleeps like a mummy and i stay quiet enough to not wake him up.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this morning he went to mass early and martin and i walked around through the vatican museum. i was wearing tight long pants i had to borrow from martin because we wouldn't be allowed in the sistine chapel with shorts. the place was ruined for me by the crowd of people. it wasn't hugely spaced like the louvre and there was hardly any space to walk. we saw very little of the museum and skipped as much as we could to go straight to the sistine chapel. there were tons of people there too that wouldn't shut up no matter how many times the workers loudly hushed. people secretly took photos. i kept looking straight up at the creation of adam. we met with fitzgerald at the vatican obelisk at st. peter's square. did nothing for the rest of our last day in rome except walk around some and sit down at a tiny little playground where parents pushed their kids on swings, old people sat on benches and talked, dogs ran around and chased each other, and a dad and his little boy kicked a soccer ball back and forth. i thought for a moment about how i was sitting on a bench eating gelato in rome, italy. i was in Italy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i've been thinking about how i just happened to land with the people i've been hanging with. i can't help but think that God placed them there with me. i picture some of the other people i've met in spain and how instead of traveling with any of them, i'm with brooke and sanat and tyler and ashley and dan. it's impossible to imagine anyone else. i don't want anyone else now. they've become my world's entire population for the past few days. i'm terrifically sad and terrified of it falling apart when school restarts, and i just know it's going to happen. they all have others, but they're all i'm capable of holding on to. i told them i miss them, and all that accomplished was getting them to tell us that we all miss each other. i guess i can fall in love with people a lot faster than i fall in love with places. hell, i fell in love at the airport before our vacation even began. and now my apocalypse is going to start tomorrow morning when dan and i leave alone for the airport. it hasn't even been a week and i can feel myself falling. accelerating. i'm now able to watch me. as. it's. unfolding. and about to eat me and swallow me whole. 6 people aren't enough to sustain a dying planet, and my heart is its core.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>brooke and sanat left on a train for florence some time today. they may be off it by now. i wonder they are. i wonder where the train is.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i want to kiss a cute girl before i leave spain.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i read bits on wikipedia about roman churches and obelisks and egyptians and i think i can get interested in this subject matter. i'm amazed at how old everything is and i love all of the names. there is nothing cooler than buildings with histories that span thousands of years. i don't think i can tire of pointlessly, fruitlessly wondering about the humans back then.</div>
<div><br/></div>

<hr/>
6-15; friday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>melancholy. this morning was a sad morning. i woke up at 6am and left our hostel with dan by 6:30 after bidding a short good-bye to tyler. sloppily ate a nectarine while dan raced over a block head of me to the train station. tossed the pit onto the street. bought a €14 ticket from termini to fiumicino airport. didn't bother looking out the windows during the ride because it wasn't the part of rome i'd have liked to see one more time before leaving. i'd have gone to the drunken ship last night even by myself if it wasn't so far away. t felt sad because of how rushed we were. i was awake for less than an hour by the time we were out of the city. too rushed to look around at the streets and buildings that had had no time to become familiar. i ran past it all and before i knew it everything was gone and behind. i fell asleep during most of the flight to lisbon while listening to mylo xyloto and kept my headphones on after the music stopped. took a lonely bus from the airport to lisbon's sete rios bus station. a police officer led away a woman with a fidgety white dog. i hope she didn't get into trouble. we missed our bus to fámita and had to wait for the next one. i wanted that bus ride to never end. it trudged through the highway past beautiful green scenic valleys and hills and apartment buildings and pastures and i stared and stared and stared while listening to mylo xyloto again until i started crying. it was cloudy and i felt melancholy and i thought about brooke and how cloudiness makes her sad and thought that maybe i just like being sad. the bus arrived at a lonely station in fámita and we walked in the sun and eventually found our hostel. it's a cute hostel and easily the best of the three i've stayed at this week. the town is tiny and completely empty and deserted. all the shops are closed. all the shops sell nothing but religious artifacts and statues of jesus and mary. the entire street that our hostel is on is under construction. i helplessly followed dan into the courtyard of the sanctuary of our lady of fátima and sat down next to him as mass begins. i excused myself to use the bathroom (i actually had to) and ended up wandering around the courtyard aimlessly. an old couple from korea asked me to take a picture of them. i was hoping they were chinese so i could actually talk to them some more. i had a notebook and pen with me but didn't write anything down about the confusing emotions i felt. about how i suddenly and intensely started to miss everything in rome. brooke and sanat, tyler, our hostel, the cobblestone streets, the colosseum, the piazzas, the city, getting drunk. about feeling more conflicted than ever about my faith in God and how i don't want to choose Him anymore and how the religion is starting to make me sick. i don't know why, but it is. i now constantly waver back and forth but i think my heart has already abandoned Him. now God is trying to call me back by bringing me to places like rome and fátima but i no longer want to listen. dan mentions that he doesn't think it's an accident that i'm here and i'm surprised that never occurred to me. anyway i stood outside the basilica while what dan had thought was mass but was actually the rosary finished and then ended up having no choice but to join him this time for actual mass. it was in spanish and i didn't understand or read any of it. there was a young girl there who was looking around with wide eyes who seemed like she could have been bored but looked attentive. it got chilly and we managed to find a small restaurant still open for dinner so i'm not going to bed hungry. i withdrew cash because i'm planning to take a bus back to lisbon tomorrow and from the bus station take a metro to a random place and wander truly aimlessly through a city i know nothing about for the whole day. i know dan is upset at that, but so am i. and i really don't want to be here right now. i keep thinking about tyler and what he's doing in rome. being struck by the loneliness that overcomes you when you realize you're all by yourself while knowing so much is going on outside you and you're not part of it. thinking guiltily about God and insisting to myself that the things dan's been telling me don't make sense and imagining how the other bcn kids would agree once i tell them. certainly v would scoff at it and tell me to shrug it off. my final decision is that i don't want to live the way i did at tech anymore and i'm embracing the new life i'm discovering at bcn. but i'm ignoring my dark vision that they don't truly care about me, the way my acf friends do. i've recognized that going out with people solely to get drunk in order to socialize with them is a very bad thing. i'm looking forward to smoking a hookah. to smoking a cigarette again. to earn their approval somehow by indulging in night life. i'm already picturing myself at a dead end. anticipating that i in fact won't make permanent friends with these people by the end of our bcn trip and all the effort i'll have put into forging relationships with them will be fruitless. and that scares me because of how quickly i've become attached to the small group of people i haven't even spent a lot of time around this week. i keep going over in my head all the interaction i had with them. friday afternoon at the airport. separating at the train. regrouping at the eiffel tower. the flea market. the restaurant. the triumphal arch. then nothing until the irish pub. getting drunk and blacking out. the piazza navona and getting drunk again. leaving them early. that's it. that's all it takes for me to intensely want their company and interest and friendship which they cast like bait that i'm frantically chasing but ultimately fail to bite because i'm a fish out of water. then there's my fear of a relapse. i'm afraid of becoming uninterested in, and subsequently neglecting, something i'm so interested in at the moment. i can't imagine wanting my old friends the same way i once did before this summer and now i don't want to want them like that. i want these new friends. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm going to try hard, and if i fall, i'm going to fall really hard.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i keep rereading the message thread with ashley rodriguez and 5 others. no one has sent me friend requests.</div>
<div><br/></div>

6-16; saturday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the lisbon metro is unimpressive. the paris subways were small. some had big tires instead of metal wheels, and those also had sideways wheels to make sure the main tired wheels wouldn't be rubbing against the side of the track. the doors could also be opened a second or two before the train stopped. i got to pull a lever exactly once. the doors almost slam shut but back off for an instant and then snap shut. some of the rome subways were covered in graffiti. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i never got a single souvenir at any of the three cities. i was ready to spend any amount of money on anything that stood out to me that i'd want to keep, and nothing did. tyler stole a shot glass from the hookah bar while drunk and didn't remember it until he found it in his dresser at our rome hostel. that's what a souvenir should be.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today i successfully managed to retreat from dan and walked to the bus station by myself and bought a ticket back to lisbon, where i truly wandered with no destination in mind at all. it wasn't as fun as i hoped but was what i expected from myself. i tried listening to mylo xyloto again but the emotions that flooded my being to tears yesterday simply weren't there. i walked through one area of the city where there were a lot of people dressed and face painted to look like statues, standing perfectly still and moving once every minute or so. went towards the shore but never made it near an actual beach and rode a train that took me deeper in the city where everything was much quitter and emptier. i bought a nectarine at a market and walked past a homeless woman three times. the area was depressing. rode around on the subway again and walked through el corte inglés fruitlessly. rode back to the first subway stop i got off at and bought a burger that i threw away half of because it was horrible. took a bus back to fátima that i fell asleep on. tomorrow morning i'm not going to the early morning mass or adoration that dan's waking up at 6 for so i'm sleeping in, taking my time packing everything, and walking to the bus station where i'll finally start the trip back to spain.</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm back at onix. we traveled all day. 9:30 wake up 10:30 fatima bus station 12:30 lisbon sete rios bus station 1:30 airport 3:30 boarded the airbus a320-200 6:00 back at barcelona 7:00 renfe to arc de triomf. &quot;nightcall&quot; by kavinsky &amp; lovefoxxx is the best song ever to listen to while staring out a window while leaving. i want &quot;we are young&quot; by fun. to forever remind me of the night at the bar in rome even though i'm not sure if it ever came on while we were drinking there. i head straight to the kebab place after climbing out of arc de triomf and sanat, ethan, and 4 others are already sitting there we say nothing to each other past the initial hi. kush talks to me only to ask me for a can of coke. i hand it to him smiling. my imaginary world implodes a little. i got laundry done tonight. it's essentially the first time my clothes have been washed in over a month because i don't think my hand washing was very effective. i suspect my ass of a roommate has slept in my bed because the sheets are wrinkled and not neatly done like they should be. i downloaded 7 albums last night at the hotel and should listen to them soon. i wonder if i'm really going to get hammered tomorrow night. it was a little strange seeing the barcelona airport a second time, walking through the baggage claim area and exiting the terminal. there a bit of home in it this time and i fondly recalled the first day i arrived there as a complete stranger cowering in the unfamiliarity. didn't even think twice about entering the onix lobby that i writhed in on the first day.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i remember the first week or two of school when i wasn't sure if i would miss anything about this trip by the time it's over. anything about the city, the school, the night life, the daily commute, the people. the answer always becomes yes, i will miss everything very much and i was sure this summer wouldn't be an exception but i underestimated how much i would miss it. it took me less than a week for my heart's own gravity to turn itself inside out. i have to look through all the photos we took or else i'm going to forget everything. i want to talk to brooke again to make sure she's still there. i'm now not questioning if i'll miss anything because i'm at the phase where the question changes into how long it will be before i forget everything i so dearly longed to hold onto. after we all part? who's going to remember me?</div>

<div>disappointing day. cecili pointed out that i like to get drunk. it's true. i like to get drunk. i'm not sure if she was getting at anything. but i'm recognizing a problem. i sat next to dani and tyler and dani said she wanted to talk to me about travel plans for our second week off. i got a little bit happy but she just wanted to know if i could take her place and  travel alone with john because she doesn't want to anymore because of something john did something during the first week off. i saw brooke walk in for the next class that i'm not in so i have to leave and don't get to say anything to her. everybody's going to the black sheep tonight.</div>

6-19; tuesday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>despite my deep conversations with david i know i'm not changing back this summer. i continue to fear that i might relapse when i get back home where i'll be immersed with my old friends and have no way of hanging out with my new ones. i want and don't want to think about it at the same time. i'm going to feel so helpless. i'll be laying in my bed at nights and not be able to do anything but reminisce while i imagine everybody else still partying with each other. it's a sad noose that'll be strangling me. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night i went up to brooke's room which was already full of people pre-gaming and in that very room i feel my attachment to her start to loosen its grip as i remind it that it's forbidden. they had tons of empty plastic water and glass liquor bottles on their desk. didn't have any alcohol to bring with me. took a few sips of tyler's sangria and heather's wine, and fewer sips of vodka. watched as brooke sipped from a glass bottle of something. went downstairs and outside and everybody had cigarettes and i wanted one too. we were a group of almost 30 people walking to the black sheep but more than half of us separated and from what i gather went to opium instead. i took a lot longer to get drunk this time and didn't get very drunk. didn't talk a lot. tyler and dani started kissing in front me and i asked her for a kiss too but she didn't answer. i was disappointed but didn't press. remembered the walk home this time. discussed germany and kissing girls with ethan.  a meh night for me. i pictured brooke dancing at the club. whatever that's like. ~</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a small shot of happiness after a lonely stroll through campus in the sun after i ate lunch by myself. maybe i'm a little wrong in my assumptions about people after all. i underestimated how much tyler and brooke would enjoy my chronicle detailing our week off. brooke commented on it and tyler loves it too. i'm feeling better. i keep rereading my note and brooke's comment. ~</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>people who might remember me:</div>
<div>• brooke</div>
<div>• dan</div>
<div>• ethan</div>
<div>• john</div>
<div>• sam</div>
<div>• tyler</div>
<div>people who will forget about me:</div>
<div>• well everyone else</div>
<div>brooke suddenly disappeared off facebook. her comments are gone, she's not tagged, her page doesn't exist, she's not on the chat list. don't know what happened. i'm sure it's a temporary thing..i hope it is.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>she walked past us into the lobby as tyler and i left for chinese food and tyler pointed out that she didn't look very happy. i was just noticing that she seemed sweaty and was wearing sneakers and thought she might have been jogging. i don't think she looked at either of us. i like hanging out with tyler now and i think he'll have a good chance of becoming one of the more lasting friends i make on this trip. i talk with him about how weird it will be seeing everybody we met here back at tech, how this city is our hometown now, how he didn't know anybody coming in here either, and that we both hope we'll be able to have reunions and hang out with each other. i remain skeptical about how many people are going to remember me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
6-20; wednesday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today it came to my mind that traveling with dan meant little to me. i didn't enjoy the experience with him, frankly, and i don't feel any closer to him despite spending a week with him and i don't really want to look at or say hi to him if i can avoid it. i wonder if that's how brooke and sanat feel about me. without thinking about it very much, possibly. that although we enjoyed a few nights together our relationships are reduced back to dusty nothing here at school. no hostility. just nothing. i failed at my job. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>there can only be ruins if something was once built.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>things i'm worried about:</div>
<div>not being able to drink when i get back home. not being able to find anyone old enough who drinks to drink with. losing the few friends i've made here to their other friends. that the city won't miss me. not going back to tech in the fall if i find a job. that i've done something wrong.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>up until a few days ago while still on our week off i thought i was going to be happy here. now i'm back to not knowing how i feel and not knowing what to do. i don't want to listen to the one friend i have who has actual advice for me. i think i've already tried everything he's telling me and i'm convinced it's never worked. i saw eric eating by himself outside while a bunch of people were in the cafe and i was in the cafe too because i was waiting for food. i was ready to go outside and sit by him. never really talked to him before. maybe he's like me too. but he got up and walked away before my food came. i wanted to then sit outside by myself in the same seat he sat in but some other guys took the table first. i'm feeling scared and sad.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>becky friended me last night and alannah a little while earlier. i've never talked to them before. i don't understand.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sierra is sitting in a row in front me. by herself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i need to remember my conversations with david because he's been through people like the ones here and has so many things to tell me. things i can actually apply. he's been more helpful than pasta and v and tom combined. he advised me to stop expecting everybody here to become my new best friends. i've told myself to stop expecting love from other people but i guess i haven't realized that i'm still expecting so much.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i want to walk back by myself while listening to coldplay.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>brooke just talked to me. that only makes me happy because of how scared i am at the fact that i can't see her on facebook. david mentioned that it's possible because of an upcoming test and i've learned that she's in spanish class that i've also heard people talking about a spanish test today so now that explanation's feasible. i hope it's true. urvashi told me she skims my tumblr posts. brooke called me &quot;dan the man&quot; and i said that i need a better nickname and she said she'll think of one. she won't.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i think brooke definitely blocked me. haven't a clue why. what in the world is going on. i just booked a flight and 3 nights at a hostel, the same that tyler, sean, marie, and caroline should be on. by myself. haven't thought about what i'm going to do once i get there. to the airport. to germany. how to get to the hostel from there. we should be on the same flight so for at least the first half i can be with them most of the time. tyler's slow to answer me on facebook. dani doesn't care about me. i feel so alone. this just in though, tyler misspelled brooke's last name on that comment of his that i thought he tagged her in but didn't show as a link for me because i was presumably blocked. the tiniest little ray of sunshine..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking about clubbing and drinking and finding it so weird how normal it is for everyone here. they know about all types of alcohol. contrasting that picture to that of my old act friends who've become my baseline. i wonder how it must be the other way around for david. i talked a little bit with urvashi about uptight friends disapproving. hers didn't like her smoking, which was understandable, but she seemed a bit surprised when i told her mine disapproved of me drinking.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i haven't felt this lonely in a long time. not since the beginning of sophomore year when i yearned so much for acf peoples' companionship. i'm feeling the same way i did then, but this time i'm longing for bcn peoples' companionship and i know i have far less of a chance of obtaining it because they're self-destructive and self-centered and are the type who will not think to wait for the quiet left in the dust. i can't imagine feeling this way towards the acf guys again and am afraid that i'll start to after summer is over and i sink back in with them. but at the same time i need to be careful to not be pushing them away when they're the only ones who have a chance of genuinely caring about me..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm keeping a facebook tab open all the time again. staying online too, just to stare at the names of everyone who i'll never be chatting with. i just don't know how to make friendships with these normal people happen. i depend too heavily on people who'll come to me themselves, and too few in the rest of the world bother with this effort.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i wish i had looked at more of brooke's pictures. if she ever comes back online i'm going to save all of them.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lamenting how they won't help people like me and at the same time noticing that i don't want to approach the other quiet people like sierra and cecili and michelle and eric. sanat talked to him about dinner plans though, so it seems people still like him some even though he's pretty quiet too from what i've seen. i'd rather try sticking to the groups, but don't know how to get in. maybe i'm killing myself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>tearing up while reading makesmethink stories as usual and feeling ashamed that i waste my life everyday wallowing and wasting time on tumblr and 9gag and facebook when people are crying everywhere. re-resolved to pour out all the love i have to everybody. if only i wasn't so scared..not about not getting love back, but just of giving it out in the first place..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
6-21; thursday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i woke up 20 minutes earlier this morning to take the bus to school instead of train. it took twice as long, the seat was destroying my butt and thighs, i didn't wait for ethan, i had to go to the bathroom, and i was starting to panic because i didn't recognize where we were at all. then a saving grace came to me when sam, eric, sean, and marie boarded the bus. they knew where to get off and i would have gotten lost if they hadn't come on board. i didn't say anything to sean about coordinating travel plans. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we watched a series of 4 videos called &quot;everything is a remix&quot; that explained that all of our ideas come from copying, transforming, and combining new ones and analyzed today's copyright and intellectual property laws and stuff. sad. i was only thinking about all the old mid-1900's culture it mentioned and worried about the possibility of losing touch with today's when i get older. most parents and old folks now have no chance of catching up with our contemporary culture and i'm scared of becoming like that when i'm as old as they are.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so i overthought again and that's bad for me but good for the overall situation because if i overthought then that means the situation wasn't as bad as i was fearing. i saw her and i think his name is chris romano eating lunch in the cafeteria so i sat with them and she remembered that she had to give me a nickname after calling me &quot;dan the man&quot; again. decided on &quot;danorama&quot; because i had taken panorama shots of our group during our vacation. peter, the boy she's always talking with, had deactivated her facebook account which is why she disappeared. i'm reminded of how bad i am at holding a conversation. i got tongue tied when i was alone with her. it was strange and unexpected i wasn't nervous or anything.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
6-22; friday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>forgot everything i had wanted to write down yesterday. arrived at school earlier than usual this morning so i could get some food. too lazy to eat in my room before leaving. saw ashley, patrick, and chris and went to sit with them. ashley greeted me more enthusiastically than i'd anticipated. i didn't say anything while they're talking and chris blew smoke from his cigarette everywhere. i sat in a row in front of tyler and marie and next to sean and cleared up a bit with them about how the hostels they/i booked in germany are miles away from the airports. they said there should be a train. marie was cracking up at something and i was surprised to find that she was reading my facebook note. sean and paco liked it, too. patrick said he'd take me shopping for alcohol later. he's out playing soccer now with a bunch of guys and several girls and i continue to refuse every time eddy politely enough invites to go play too. i wonder what i'm missing out on. we'll see if patrick holds up to his promise. i'm a little worried about not enjoying the wolf club tonight. if i go. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i just went out to mercadona with patrick and i got:</div>
<div>- knebep vodka</div>
<div>- bacardi rum</div>
<div>- don simon sangria</div>
<div>- don simon orange juice</div>
<div>- sangria</div>
<div>first time buying my own alcohol. hooray for me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
6-23; saturday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it's 5:11 am. i'm so confused. and pretty drunk as of now. i was already buzzed when we went to the wolf club and can barely remember the subway ride there. i danced there like never before. anna started grinding against me for ten minutes or so before i finished my drink and i don't think i excused myself in any way to put my glass on the counter somewhere. was alone for the rest of the night after that. left the club briefly to smoke a cigarette and some i-think-it-was weed. that was with tyler and chris romano and sanat and a couple others. anna and everyone else disappeared after that. i walked home with tyler, csukas, and kush and we stopped by anna's room where i think sidney was sleeping passed out and they all got a slice of bread and csukas took a banana which he put in dani's sink in her room, whose door was open but the room was empty. i'm so confused. i elected to go back to my room by myself but they all wanted to do drunk things while drunk. i'm too tired. we'll see how much of the night i remember in the morning tomorrow. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and now for a more comprehensive review of last night:</div>
<div>after buying my first few bottles of alcohol i went to my room and mixed some with sprite and juice and drank it. didn't watch the eurocup game in the tv room with people. showered. mixed bacardi mojito with a little bit of sprite and vodka into a big empty water bottle. for the first time i was excited about pregaming and had a drink of my own to bring. i was on my way down to reid's room and i think i bumped into tyler and 4 others in the elevator and i went with them instead to eric's and sanat's room. all the girls were in ridiculous outfits. met brooke somewhere in the hall. she had a scarf wrapped around her chest, showing her bellybutton. i complimented it. told her i wanted to be drunk by the time i got to the club and she said she was going completely sober. becky's face was very red. we started playing a game called bet your liver. ashley told me that she thought it was funny when i mentioned sharing a cigarette with her in my note and that that was the first pack of cigarettes she'd bought in her life. that means she read the note. based on the things i heard dani say about birth control and condoms, she's not a virgin. ethan dropped his big bottle of beer on the floor and it shattered and the smell of beer filled the room. he somehow cut himself on the glass somewhere on his thumb i think. he didn't join us that night. finished the rest of my bottle as quickly as i could without chugging and left it on the counter as we all filed out of his room.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>our group separated and some of us took the metro and i think this is when i blacked out for around 15 minutes because i don't remember the train ride, or transferring to another train. all i can recall is the low ceiling in the tunnel we walked through. can't recall much while walking to the club, except that sanat gave me a mostly intact cigarette. the club was called the factory. i think tyler said i was his extra guest and the person looking over the guest list never had to look up my name even though someone said it out loud. i think he paid €5. couldn't hear any noise at all from outside the club. it was just a couple minutes past 1 by now.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>brooke and some others reappear inside. we were given a ticket at the door and i was only allowed to get a free beer with it. it continued to be nasty and i gave almost all of it away, i think to brooke. she assured me again that it was an acquired taste. music is playing and we're dancing. i paid €8 for a shitty drink because i hadn't drunk much of the beer. anna comes out of nowhere and sandwiches me between her and a wall. we grind. i think she was saying to someone that i was a good dancer. well i'd like her to have said that. still had the drink in my hand and was trying to finish it as fast as i could so i could put my other arm on her waist too. don't remember who stopped dancing first, or if it was before or after i actually finished the drink.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we went outside for a bit. i keep looking for tyler to follow. chris romano was there and sanat was there and csukas was there and eddy was there. i smoked an entire cigarette for the first time but didn't think i was doing it properly. chris passed a bit of i-think-it-was weed around and i had no problems with trying it but couldn't taste or feel anything even after trying 2 or 3 times. csukas shook my hand. i kept tapping the cigarette to make the ash fall away. i wonder how i looked holding a cigarette.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we went back inside and nothing interesting happened.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i left the club at around 4:30 with tyler, csukas, and kush. not my favorite people. i don't know where everyone else had gone, if they were still inside or if they had left earlier. the metros aren't running now so we walk back. my legs must have been tired from all the jumping around i did but i couldn't feel it. kush kept calling me a pedophile and i said fuck you every time he said shut up pedophile. (the following may be out of order:) they peed off a bridge, which i thought was so stupid. back at onix, we visit sidney's and anna's room and someone else answers the door. sidney's (i think it was sidney) asleep and her friend gave us bread. we're wondering where anna  is because csukas somehow has her money, room key, and some ID card, might have been her driver's license. then we went to dani's room (i think it was dani's room) where the door was left ajar and girl's clothes and dresses were hung up everywhere. csukas left a banana in her sink. we waited on the couches in the lobby for something but i don't remember what. brooke and peter polack come back inside. we went upstairs and brooke and peter walk into a room together.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i jumped up and down a lot with my right arm in the air. the whole point of coming out tonight was to see ralf popescu play, but i don't remember ever seeing him because i never looked at the dj a lot. the club never got as packed as razz matazz. i remember people cheering for a bit when i think a new dj came on. popeska?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>surprises:</div>
<div>- how often everybody drinks/clubs</div>
<div>- how long everybody's already been drinking/clubbing</div>
<div>- how much everybody knows about drinking/clubbing</div>
<div>- the sheer number of people who are the above</div>
<div><br/></div>

6-24; sunday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>2:10 </div>
<div>i, am drunk again. we were at the beach this time. mixed vodka, sprite, orange juice. we all went to the beach. but i’m not seeing the run rise today. i have a headache and i’m so tired. worried about being hung over in the morning. went in the water at the beach. bunch of us went skinny dipping but i never took my trunks off. fireworks everywhere. john walked me all the way back. he said he’s going all the way back to the beach. can’t type right now. too drunk. i’m going to pass out. didn’t find any girls to kiss today,</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>watched most of v for vendetta yesterday evening and then took what was left of my bacardi mojito and finished that while sitting in the tv room with everybody to watch the soccer game. spain won. we left before the match was over while spain had a 2-0 lead over france so we didn't even bother watching the rest of the game and we all gathered in the lobby for the beach. i was originally wearing shorts over my swim trunks so i could put my socks inside once we got to the water because i didn't want to walk without socks because my flip flops are too uncomfortable but i took my shorts off and just went with trunks. people kept asking me why i didn't just go without socks and i told them my flip flops are too uncomfortable. tyler unofficially made a bet with me that my socks would either be missing or wet by the end of the night and the loser would have to take a shot in class. john told me he liked my note because it was so honest. we started singing lonely island songs when we neared the shore.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at the beach:</div>
<div>people were drunk. i was drunk. i took my socks off and shoved them into my right pocket. fireworks kept going off near us. people went in the water and i took my shirt off and tossed it into the middle of our circle. gave my room key, €20, and copy of my passport to someone, i think felipe. waded in with my glasses on and my socks in my pocket. i'm surprised they didn't float out. not sure if i started shivering. being drunk certainly made the water feel nowhere near as cold as it probably was. several people got naked. sean walked in with his jeans on. someone took a picture of a couple of us (not me) from behind, walking in the water naked. marie said she was naked.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>got out of the water and i started walking with john and eddy to look for girls, i think for me because i kept saying i wanted to kiss one. the dark, drunkenness, and wet glasses meant i couldn't see anything very clearly. we were fruitless and then i started getting a headache. i found my shirt in the sand (looked for a circle with a ship in it) and i think felipe gave me my stuff back and i shoved that in my wet left pocket and i walked without socks with john back to onix. he said he was going all the way back to the beach by himself. i think i washed the sand off my feet before going to bed.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my socks are wet.</div>
<div><br/></div>

6-25; monday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>internet is making me so distracted. i wonder how much my attention span has been reduced. today, nothing happened between me and anna on friday. people frustrate me. i’m one of the people who frustrate me. people don’t look at me. i don’t look at people and we always miss each other. booked a first class train ticket from munich to berlin. oh my god i want to get out of here move move move move </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>walking is something i think i might do more often by myself in the evening in unexplored areas of the city. dogs running and couples kissing. i want to meet a nice girl and sit down on a bench and talk for an hour or two hours or three hours and kiss. i smudged my signature on the back of my new credit card and i’m very annoyed.</div>

6-27; wednesday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday i was ready to endure the hour long bus ride to school instead of the train so i wouldn't get drenched in sweat walking up the hill in the sun, but met a few people in the lobby so i commuted with them instead. this morning i was ready to endure the hour long bus ride to school instead of the train so i wouldn't get drenched in sweat walking up the hill in the sun, met the same few people in the lobby, and walked without them to the bus stop. i was 10 minutes late for class and didn't panic. chris walked in and sat in the row behind me instead of next to me. i thought about how few female friends i have. chris sat by himself in the cafe and the table of 5 next to him ignored him. i sat by myself and the table of 5 next to me ignored me. i still go most days without talking. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday asta talked to me again but wouldn't skype. i sat next to sam in class and we laughed over funny things. i complained to david about my roommate and he explained that some people just don't have common sense. returned to the chinese restaurant and awkwardly mumbled to the cute waitress what i wanted.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i can't concentrate.</div>

6-29; friday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>drunken night. i brought my bottle of rum to the tv room mainly to drink rather than watch the germany/italy game (italy won). it was a lot emptier than i thought and almost no one had drinks. it was too early to pregame, that's why. i left during half time and didn't come back. ethan posted on facebook to meet in the lobby at 23:30 to go to the black sheep. i went to the lobby and it was empty. bumped into ashley who said she wasn't coming with us, then tyler, then eddy. we went up to brooke's room again, where everyone was drinking again and where she smiled at me. tyler helped me finish the rum i had left. on our way to the bar i smoked another cigarette and i and sanat were the only ones in our group who were smoking. brooke and peter were arm-in-arm/holding hands. i got the smoke down my throat and into my lungs this time and coughed. people called me badass. i don't think i'll be smoking again. threw my empty rum bottle into a bin that wasn't meant for glass. a few people called me/tyler out on it because tyler had told me to throw it in there. we arrived at a different black sheep, which was huge. i sat down next to ethan and tyler and near chris julian and sidney and we got another sangria tower and started playing never have i ever yet again. blindly drunk by my second glass. sidney mentioned to me that i could dance and that she knew i had danced with anna. i danced around with sidney for a minute or so. she guided me and i didn't know what i was doing. i made her spill a drink and some of it got onto my shorts legs. as far as i could tell i had just bumped my hand into hers while turning around but being drunk made me unaware of how hard i actually hit her. her glass shattered. i said sorry twice and she was very nice. brooke and peter made out. i learned that virtually nobody around me had never had sex. blacked out and didn't remember the walk home again, but i'm fairly certain i wasn't leaning on anyone. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ashley smiled at me when i walked in class today. i sat in front of her and brooke and peter and next to sam, who's the easiest to laugh with. a lot of people went to the beach afterwards. i know brooke and peter went straight there, where they were probably kissing again. felt baselessly unincluded in everybody's lunch and afternoon plans. was afraid to join conversations because i felt that people might think i'm annoying. ate lunch at mcdonald's with sean marie and chris. they didn't seem to hate me. chris asked me what my burger was and i said a quarter pounder. marie's a really funny person and i adore her laugh.</div>

6-30; saturday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>2:49 am </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>disappointing night. nowhere near as drunk as yesterday. listening to &quot;laughing with&quot; by regina spektor by myself back in my room. pre gamed in room 122 with a cup of rum/coke. slightly buzzed by the time i get a kebab with tyler and rahul. met with the rest of our group at the black sheep, which we took a metro to. ashley hugged me and told me i was her favorite person on the trip and called me badass. they didn't have mojitos there so i got a glass of sangria and drink it as fast as i can by the time we left for the wolf club. paid €5 after telling the person we were with heather taylor. i was never aware we had to sign up to get on the guest list. never saw heather at the club. drunk enough to easily dance. still danced quiet easily after most of my drunkenness wore off. didn't dance with becky didn't dance with ashley didn't dance with sidney didn't dance with anybody. didn't kiss anybody. touched the straw becky had tucked behind her ear and she gave me a weird look. discouraged. got some flavored vodka sprayed in my mouth with a water gun. got my picture taken with my arm raised in the air. i hope it'll be on facebook for me to see. i got bored quickly and even stopped dancing. some guy talked to sidney and in less than two minutes started kissing her neck. i felt an urge to pull her away from him but barely acted on it. didn't get any beer because i was afraid it would make me sick. it was funny seeing everybody moving their bodies dancing. especially those who are usually quiet like me. left the club quiet early with tyler. it was because we pre gamed too early, he said. i agreed. we talk about the other dan again and christianity and god again on the walk back, and how unnatural and strict and meaningless he and his chosen lifestyle seemed to be. i mentioned regina spektor's song about the things that make us stop laughing at god and instead try to start laughing with god. i rarely get back to onix this sober and am sober enough to type all this up and take a shower before going to bed because i'm sweaty and nasty. it was just a disappointing and somewhat of a thoughtful night. a  little bit sad right now. drunk enough to believe that it'll get better some other night.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ashley asked me to eat with her. i think she came to me because she wanted chinese food. she ended up inviting anyone who wanted to go by posting in the facebook group, but it was largely ignored and when i went to meet her in the lobby the other dan was there too. what the fuck was he doing here? i got annoyed at him the whole time for being with us, because it reminded me of traveling with him and how awkward he is. a man dropped a box of tools and dan was the only one of us to bend down and help him pick everything up. the chinese place was closed so we went to a different kebab restaurant where i avoided eye contact with him but caught him looking at me several times, once with that awful smile of his. ashley talked a lot and was completely unfazed by the strain i always perceive from his attempted conversations. i wonder if she thinks of me the same way she thinks of him, socially.</div>

<div>today i thought about how time supposedly seems to pass by more quickly when we spend it all doing the same things over and over. i'm stuck in a far less than ideal work environment for at least 8 hours every day now, but i'm not sure i have the right to worry about something like this. it's my co-workers who have me realizing again that traits i dislike in other people are often ones that i also see in myself. i get annoyed sometimes, thinking about their mannerisms, the way they talk (quiet and not very expressive) but it's impossible to ignore the same in me. one person who i have an easier time talking to is dmitry. i don't want to drive people to lunch in the bmw i've been driving to work in all week.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today i also went to a toastmasters meeting. toatsmasters is this organization (international, apparently) for people who are shy and have trouble speaking in front of other people, and they meet together and exercise their voices and communication. my parents found it online after dale had called my dad, giving him the &quot;shit&quot; about how my communication sucks. i didn't know what sort of setting it would be held in, nor was i nervous (i was just numb to it again). for some reason it made me think of the first time i sat in on a boy scouts meeting. i'm pretty sure it's boy scouts that i'm thinking of. anyway, i hated the entire toastmasters meeting, sitting through the 2 hours with a hard, unforgiving heart. all of the people there were grown-ups. should that have been expected? because i wasn't expecting it, was a little shocked when i walked into the room and found myself staring at all those adults. i listened to them speak. few were effective. everything was planned and carried out unnervingly formally. i listened to some of them give speeches. they clearly weren't destined to be speakers. i shuddered at the thought of myself looking and sounding like they did when i'm their age. when they made the guests speak, i had to say something, and while i was talking, i swallowed, clasped my hands in front of my throat, and shook my leg. for now mom is still insisting that i go to their next meeting, but i'm 99% against it. a handful of thoughts have me swaying the slightest, tiniest bit. mostly thoughts about not even being able to call people by their names, and too afraid to open my arms and shout when i'm happy or sad. maybe i need this more than i'll ever be willing to admit to myself. but i'm too scared to go. how sad it is that i need to practice this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday, a girl cashier at dunkin' donuts told me my credit card is pretty. i just smiled and said thank you. posted about it to facebook as soon as i got home. &quot;why didn't i tell her she's pretty?!&quot; i wrote. strange that it was almost exciting. that is until i thought about jessie roth and all of her interactions with strangers that she posts about.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hindrances. my lack of courage to SPEAK is by far my most hated feature. if i can just remember to not smile until i mean it, from now on.<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>i think i'm going to be glad that david isn't going to be at school next year. i think he stopped considering me a friend. pardon me for jumping to conclusions, but it seems to me that i became someone he let out his negative thoughts to, because i exuded negativity myself, and when he decided to stop it he brushed me away too. every time i've tried to talk to him after that, his responses were always short, oftentimes feeling curt. i'd find false comfort whenever he used &quot;lol&quot; or emoticons. i'm unusually irked by the picture he posted of his workspace, that received over 40 likes when i saw it, and probably has a lot more now. i don't care how his relationship with steph is going.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today my mother reminded me that i need to stay acquainted with my friends at school, and i know i'm going to begin worrying about it and regretting soon. mike texted me a few days ago, and it's a little awful, come to think about it, how surprised i was that he would think to do that (he must have forgotten to respond to my last one). he told me sam was making his move to texas today. so that means he should be there now. i haven't talked to anybody there. now that i know i'm not important anymore, my thoughts have begun to turn to yan, and a little to monique, and not anjaly anymore, but mostly yan. and i know i'm setting myself up for disappointment yet again.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>to recap the weekend:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>again, i wanted to leave the chinese school picnic as soon as i got there. i got out of the car just behind charles and his dad, and at my dad's suggestion we &quot;shook hands&quot; (that's in quotes because his handshake was completely effortless). i didn't say a word to him. i thought about seeing amanda xue there, as i had the last time i went, but i didn't know a single person there, besides family acquaintances. i was very self-conscious of how i was standing weakly and without any energy. i hate standing like that, it makes me feel miserable.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the next day was our lunch for father's day. i think this was supposed to count as one of our big outings with the usual families, but it felt like an exception somehow because so many people weren't there. michael didn't come, charles didn't come, and alex's family has been absent for a while now. lisa meanwhile has lost every bit of her cute little girl persona that i'd been so used to seeing, years ago, when we were all younger. she walked in with her ears plugged in, holding a driver's manual. that really took me aback. she and tracy have been in high school, and they're not kids anymore. so there really were no kids there. i almost feel like i wasted my time by being there, since charles and michael didn't even bother to show up. i feel lame for having looked forward to this the slightest bit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>afterwards came my brother's chinese school graduation. he looked a little ridiculous in his cap and gown because his hair has grown so long and he continually refuses to get it cut. the ceremony was held in a building on rutgers' campus, and i walked around the empty building but there wasn't much to see. it was empty and there were no students anywhere. i don't know if i should have been expecting no students. i thought about the s/e kids who ended up picking this place. kelly, justin...well not many names. maybe some of them ate at the cafe in the building, or played at one of the pool tables upstairs.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'd be lying if i say i don't miss Zora. i've even begun to think back to the day we met online and how much time we had spent playing L4D2 together. all the things i'd skip during school for her. ACF meetings, meals, homework time, studying. then when she had a crush on me while i was in london. i wonder if i would have stood a little bit less firmly against her if v hadn't warned me about how fucked up it kind of was. i must admit that i was happy when she invited me to a game (even though it was a versus game and i'm scared of versus). she plays versus now and has a higher win rate than me.<br/></div>

<en-note style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">
the 6th of June
<div><br/></div><div>It's before midnight for once. My internals have come to completely standstill. All of my habits have come to a total halt. I don't dream anymore, dead or alive. More than two weeks have passwed since the last stranger smiled good-bye to me at the airport. That's a day after the Canadian family got home.</div><div><br/></div><div>I can't remember what some of their faces look like, which is frightening. Dangerous, too. Mind has squeezed itself into its tightest space yet. When I get back down there, a new twist on old emotions will crush me. This time I can anticipate it. There is no telling what will end up in flames.</div><div><br/></div><div>I still need to tell Lisa that I won't be seeing her in New York. And no, I don't think she <u>     </u>.</div><div><br/></div><div>Took a walk with Tom through Battlefield Park last week. How selfish of me to wish I could share it with someone else instead. Hopefully I can see him again before time becomes more unpredictable than ever.</div><div><br/></div><div>Things can get better, but Things can get worse, too. Don't automatically assume gravity disappears after fall once, you're (I'm) climbing <u>up</u> a mountain now.</div><div><br/></div><div>And remember, God lives down there too, so you'll (I'll) be running into H/him again soon.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
6-16 m</div><div><br/></div><div>I can't believe it was only this morning that I woke up in our hotel room preparing to go to my first day of real work. Early mornings do mess with my head. Milestones become little more than pebbles. There was little that was remarkable at the orientation, which went quietly with me and the other quiet people. That side of me and they are one of the things I dislike about this field. I don't like that I will need to become friends with my coworkers to survive my new life. That's what makes me my worst enemy. The ACF crowd doesn't need me and I can't ping them. For some reason I will target Monique and Vince. Finally, and I could not be any less surprised, I miss my mother and wish she were still here.</div><div><br/></div><div>Tom is like God, I only reach out to him when I need him.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
6-17 t</div><div><br/></div><div>Today I obtained proof that I am officially terminated at the CRC. I tried saying something on Tumblr about this, but it was useless. The competition pool reopened some time ago. I became a certified lifeguard some nine months ago. All it took was one glance at the guard stationed at the east end to get my chest going. And I glanced twice.</div><div><br/></div><div>I ate lunch with a large group who go out to a Mexican restaurant every Tuesday. One of them has gone every week for 20 years. I met two co-ops, a girl and a boy. They were both quiet but I was at least as quiet as they were. Jealousy acts unreasonably, and quickly. I was attracted to her.</div><div><br/></div><div>I tried getting in touch with Vince today. Sometimes, as far as I'm concerned, he (with the rest of ACF) doesn't exist. Much like God, again. Maybe I'll see someone soon.</div><div><br/></div><div>Tom is going through what I am going through but the difference is ????????. What help is there to give?</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
6-18 w</div><div><br/></div><div>(The pool a third time)</div><div><br/></div><div>While running between the CRC and CoC:</div><div><ul><li>the guy at the CoC always seems very nervous and stammers a lot when talking</li><li>Brenda in her normal form isn't as nice as she was when she came in to our class 9 months ago (not saying she is not nice)</li><li>Nate appeared. I'd forgotten to send him a thank-you reply email. Seeing him was like being in a flashback. He's a member of a society in the past to me, still living.</li></ul><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
6-22 n</div></div><div><br/></div><div>I've been stuck in a foreign type of limbo all week, dead inside. Nothing exists, hopefully temporarily. I'm always at Ikea to shop for parts, and there are always young couples and budding families. Certain kinds of people make my heart crack instantly.</div><div><br/></div><div>I just realized that I can now go see movies by myself whenever I want. I'll learn to be like Jessie, maybe.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
6-23 m</div><div><br/></div><div>I've been going through a musical drought, too. Not that there has been very much any notes could bring back later. The sickness didn't last so long this time.</div><div><br/></div><div>After hours, I parked in a mostly empty student center deck. No dream this time, and walking on campus, back to the CULC, barely felt like one. It actually wasn't very long ago at all that I walked around all the buildings feeling sad. Now I know there was nothing to be sad about. I wonder if Tom misses his school.</div><div><br/></div><div>Yan drove by me at Tech Square, making her the third (the second was Austin Roberts).</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
6-24 t</div><div><br/></div><div>Still not forseeing any significant investment in making work friends. The youngest ones there are all older than me. They often talk about their kids. I'm pretty sure they're what all the names refer to.</div><div><br/></div><div>Today [the] Dave invited me to Jalisco. I assumed he simply asked everyone, but there were only five of us, although there could have been more going on in the chatroom that I didn't want to automatically join. A girl Susie/Susan I forget which and the girl (forgot name) talked for most of the way. (forgot name) told us about a situation her husband got into with the cops (how's that for a sour taste?). [The] Susie, at the table, mentioned things like Weight Watchers and how her husband committed suicide a year ago. That's new. I said next to nothing except for answering a few of [the] Susie's questions. [the] Dave just seemed to like how many nachos they were giving out. The other quiet guy sat the edge and said very little, too.</div><div><br/></div><div>I wonder how ordinary of a person [the] Patrick is. And [the] Greg. What do you think they do at home?</div><div><br/></div><div>Laurie is the fourth. She just asked how I was. Maybe she too is plagued by the stranger sickness that affects the rest of us.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
6-25 w</div><div><br/></div><div>Nothing, really, and I don't see things calming for some time. Making friends seems so hopeless, like there's no opportunities for it. I know it's just me creating barriers for myself, but they're so strong. Soon Tom will have no need for me. He's probably already ahead.</div><div><br/></div><div>If only I wasn't so quiet.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
6-27 f</div><div><br/></div><div>There's something increasingly disturbing about being left alone. I just got back from the theater, my first time there alone. Increasingly insecure.</div><div><br/></div><div>I had lunch with co-workers. [The] Greg, [the] Patrick, and [the] Bobby today. Still nothing to speak of, really. They asked me a few questions about myself and NJ and I was afraid to answer.</div><div><br/></div><div>Maybe I put more faith in God than I'm willing to admit, because so far He's been the only one changing things.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

I never gave any thought to how strange it was to be driving a new person to such an event. who the fuck am I. incidentally, the plaza we met up in before continuing to the lake is the same one that david and steph took me to on my birthday. after the second and last time I attended their church. my last birthday fell on a sunday.</div><div><br/></div><div>I told her to connect her phone to the AUX cable to play music and I drove up I-85, the same way that I&apos;ll be going again in an estimated two weeks when I should be on my way home for the third time in six months. she asked me what kind of music I listen to and I still can&apos;t answer that simple question. I didn&apos;t say anything about how I deliberately imprint emotional memory to the music I&apos;m listening to. once I&apos;m on the road, I&apos;ll be between worlds. I enjoy the 13-14 hour drive far more than a 90-minute flight.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m a little overdressed for a beach occasion. didn&apos;t have sandals and I&apos;m pants. it&apos;s a little humid. girls in bikinis everywhere. I forgot they have those. the Joanna is standing with a circle of asian boys. this is an asian meetup group after all. she watches me as I respond to one of them introducing himself to me, and laughs. I feel like I haven&apos;t improved at all. I don&apos;t feel like drinking, at all.</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s a social anxiety value pack. huge crowds, half-dressed guys and girls, kids, loud music. three hours. twenty dollars. plus another ten for parking. I&apos;ve already taken off my outer shirt because it&apos;s hot and uncomfortable. follow everyone to a table, in line with the front of the stage. the music is so loud I can barely hear myself when I&apos;m screaming as hard as I can. why is every guy introducing himself to me? I don&apos;t remember most names. a William next to me goes through a question checklist. we strike a bit of gold on &quot;video games&quot;. he knows of L4D2. vs or campaign? pc or console? he gives me his steam name. I&apos;ll add him later. he doesn&apos;t go on steam, he says. will he check?</div><div><br/></div><div>besides the Kat and the Joanna, there is one other girl here. she&apos;s small, and cute. &quot;hello I&apos;m with the cute police, I&apos;m going to have to see your license.&quot; I want to say that to someone, but I have plenty of excuses to not say it today.</div><div><br/></div><div>the William has a volleyball so we head into the sand and most of them play volleyball. there&apos;s no way in hell I&apos;m joining the volleyball. off to the side some dude grabs a girl&apos;s butt as they make out. they&apos;re not very good at volleyball.</div><div><br/></div><div>the fireworks starts. everybody including me has their phones aimed at the sky. incidentally, I had a dream two days ago that I was part of a large crowd, all looking up at fireworks in the sky. by the water, too.</div><div><br/></div><div>the Kat pokes me and remarks that I don&apos;t seem bothered by it. I&apos;m not. it reminds me of lillian, but I can only think of steph who used to do it at all.</div><div><br/></div><div>we all drag some chairs right by the shore and dip our feet into the water. I have to take my shoes and socks off first. the Kat doesn&apos;t want to initially because she&apos;s afraid of things in the water. I tell her she has irrational fears. may she does anyway only because she sees that I am. I&apos;m a seventh wheel. there are three pairs of conversation partners and I am alone. I stare into the distance and think about this.</div><div><br/></div><div>they close at 11, thank god. away from the water. our group starts disbanding. nice to meet you *shakes hand* thanks. we should hang out again. who are you again?</div><div><br/></div><div>I wonder if the Kat and Joanna ever talk about me, and what the Joanna would have to say.</div><div><br/></div><div>I kind of feel like I have some value because I drove the Kat here while most others came alone. for once. if I embrace this it will bite me.</div><div><br/></div><div>I start playing lights in the car but it doesn&apos;t work. lights already has an association. I didn&apos;t want to &quot;contaminate&quot; the &apos;life is strange&apos; songs but they need to be the soundtrack for this era and everything that happens before it ends.</div><div><br/></div><div>she sort of asks if I want to eat at the pho restaurant we met outside and I lamely decline. I claim that I&apos;m more careful about my diet now. that&apos;s only partially true. I&apos;m a little afraid that she&apos;ll try to kiss me. now that is an irrational fear.</div><div><br/></div><div>what does she think? it&apos;s still clear that she likes me, but... I don&apos;t like her so...in return. I ashamedly wonder if, if I were attracted to her, we&apos;d have made out or had sex by now, if I wanted to. a boy can dream. I&apos;ve never had it and that worsens the worry.</div><div><br/></div><div>my playlist finishes right as I drive into the mcdonald&apos;s for a late night snack.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>6-7 n</b></div><div><br/></div><div>158 n</div><div><br/></div><div>interesting developments. today I helped Krish pick up a sofa and ottoman he bought on craigslist from some guy who recently got married. he rented a zipvan and we drove the piece of shit over to the guy&apos;s apartment and then drove back to his place. it was the first time I&apos;ve been inside. it looked rather temporary. a little messy, lots of ikea furniture, sparsely decorated. high ceiling and untiled floor. made me think of an art museum for some reason. I kept making jokes about his relationship with Abbey.</div><div><br/></div><div>I &quot;gave [him] the skinny&quot; on the party with the Kat yesterday, which I guess was a date. I didn&apos;t realize how clueless I&apos;ve been about dating this whole time. I didn&apos;t know it was a date. he&apos;s hell-bent on getting me to explicitly ask her out. there are so many things I don&apos;t understand.</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s obvious now that flirting is easy when you&apos;re not dependent on the outcome at all. Krish pointed out some &quot;good lines&quot; in my text conversation with her. I hadn&apos;t been trying for anything at all. she had even referred to my penis in her last message, the one which I didn&apos;t respond to yesterday, and I actually genuinely had no idea what she&apos;d meant until Krish pointed it out.</div><div><br/></div><div>we went to honey bubble after returning the van to its spot, where he bought me a taro milk tea that I didn&apos;t enjoy that much. we talked more about dating while I kept looking at a really pretty girl sitting at the table in front of us. I agreed to send the Kat a text (two texts) asking her out...officially? after he continually pressed me. I wonder how it made her feel when she saw them. I&apos;m still scared, but I suppose this opportunity is a little something that I can&apos;t let pass. experimentation, exploration.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m starting to think about having sex with her now and it&apos;s terrifying because I&apos;m not attracted to her. imagining giving oral, receiving oral, and her moaning. a small difference would make a big one in the way I&apos;m reacting to such thoughts, that being how physically pretty she is. I don&apos;t like this.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>6-8 m</b></div><div><br/></div><div>neither Mark nor the Amber were at work today, so it was just me and Christian at the gym. well we&apos;re at least basic friends now, something that I suppose would have been hard for me to accept some months back when I was still bent on hating people. although we still are clearly not very comfortable around each other. actually what am I saying. I can&apos;t speak for him; I&apos;m the one not comfortable with being myself around him. I depend too much on the other person to decide how I want to behave. if it were Mark, I&apos;d be far more relaxed because he&apos;d have no problem doing the same. or so I&apos;d perceive it. even Christian was able to talk about things like confronting bullies and refusing to stand by idly while someone&apos;s getting harassed. see, if the Amber were there I wouldn&apos;t have stood a chance at the conversation. we had a nice workout I guess.</div><div><br/></div><div>in the evening was the storytelling thing with Krish and Abbey. I haven&apos;t seen her in almost two months. when they met up at the bar, he gave her a peck on the lips. (whoa) I didn&apos;t know they were THAT close. even though he hasn&apos;t been keeping it too secret from me or anything. it was just unexpected to see it in person. the stories and improv comedy were whatever. I hardly laughed at anything. I wasn&apos;t even in a down mood, I just didn&apos;t find most of it funny. meanwhile all the others were laughing their asses off. I could hear Abbey. I&apos;m not stuck to her at all, but the way my thoughts keep jumping to her remind me of how I used to feel about steph.</div><div><br/></div><div>Krish and I had essentially attempted the same thing with her, and our results are so far apart it&apos;s hilarious. was it easy for him? did he have to do a lot of engineering? have/are they had/having sex?</div><div><br/></div><div>he looked at my phone again to see my conversation with the Kat, whose name I just told him (and Abbey) tonight. Abbey refused to look at my texts at first, saying she would if I wanted her to so I basically asked her to. she commented that I haven&apos;t even saved the Kat&apos;s name to my phone. then that the conversation was indeed &quot;really sexual.&quot; I really don&apos;t know if this has positively or negatively influenced her perception of me. Krish keeps telling me to invite the Kat over and &quot;bang her&quot; and I don&apos;t know if he&apos;s serious or not. I try to not allow myself to think about how I could get lucky right now if I really wanted to. I&apos;m starting to think about whether I&apos;ll be able to deal with having sex with her. but deep down I know there&apos;s no way I&apos;m letting my first sexual experience be with her.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>6-10 w</b></div><div><br/></div><div>hung out with Krish again today. he seemed to have forgotten about the movie. didn&apos;t bug him about it. I picked him up and we went to flip burger. ended up not catching the movie because I ate too slowly. he seemed to open up a little more about his relationships and social life to me. about Abbey, and that woman called Wendy who he&apos;s mentioned several times before, who&apos;s forty years old. he said she was ugly but had slept with her anyway. didn&apos;t confirm for sure if that meant he had sex with her. he told me that I should have sex with the Kat because I should have sex with any woman I can, even if I&apos;m not attracted to her. I disagreed. if she wouldn&apos;t be my first then maybe I&apos;d be a little more open to...considering it at least. I don&apos;t know if he can tell that that&apos;s the case.</div><div><br/></div><div>he looked at my text conversation with Kat again. apparently he didn&apos;t remember Abbey discussing it with us on monday because he was &quot;pretty drunk.&quot; offered some more help on what I should say. small details: he saw that I&apos;d texted Abbey and that she didn&apos;t answer. proclaimed that he liked her a little less now. Abbey digs deep into his facebook activity. they may not date for too much longer. this doesn&apos;t give me hope, just insight into his own person and how he looks at things. although thinking of Abbey still reminds me just a little bit of how I once felt about steph.</div><div><br/></div><div>afterwards we went to his place, second time I&apos;ve been there, and we didn&apos;t do much. he offered me some scotch and I had my first taste of scotch. it actually tasted just the way I expected and I liked it. then a can of some beer which was horrible. we didn&apos;t do much. sat in silence a lot. it wasn&apos;t awkward, it was just empty silence. I hoped he was annoyed at my silence.</div><div><br/></div><div>when I got back home, I messaged Jessie on facebook. we haven&apos;t talked in nine months but Krish said to not burn bridges. I figured I&apos;d give it yet another try.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>6-15 m</b></div><div><br/></div><div>I wonder if she left disappointed, and if so, how disappointed she was.</div><div><br/></div><div>I was distinctly uncomfortable the whole time. always maintaining distance, watching every move she made, trying to hear what she was saying whenever she started mumbling. I decided that I dislike having anyone in my living space.</div><div><br/></div><div>I have almost never been a host to anyone before. scrambling to remember my responsibilities. would you like something to drink? I probably worded that differently, do you want anything to drink? I never heard a clear answer and I never got her anything. she seemed to be more concerned about the chardonnay, anyway.</div><div><br/></div><div>promises broken: to make crepes with nutella and to play a song on my flute.</div><div><br/></div><div>she didn&apos;t know how to react to a lot of my actions.</div><div><br/></div><div>I showed her fucking &apos;amnesia: the dark descent of all things&apos;, and she played it for a while. mumbling in a soft voice, seemingly not reacting genuinely to any of the scares. she is 0% gamer and struggled with the most basic controls. it mildly annoyed me.</div><div><br/></div><div>she blatantly asked me if I watch porn and I made the mistake of including the word &quot;anymore&quot; in my answer. which might not have been entirely truthful because I&apos;ve been slipping a little bit for the past few weeks. then she created a new google account (apparently she can&apos;t remember her own email password) to watch age-restricted youtube videos from the results of a search for &quot;tantric sex&quot;. every one she selected was a slideshow of images with either generic-sounding meditation music or narration provided by computer generated speech.</div><div><br/></div><div>then I showed her the fucking uncle dolan show videos, and we got through ten of them. then some ownage pranks videos. and then I started talking about Life Is Strange, and we played a bit of the game together. I was a little tipsy. we both agreed that the music was really nice.</div><div><br/></div><div>she liked sitting down on the floor next to the bamboo mat. I made sure to stay in my chair.</div><div><br/></div><div>at least I was able to give her a proper hug in the parking garage.</div><div><br/></div><div>I have no idea why she likes me so much but she makes me uncomfortable. I wonder if I&apos;ll ever be able to become intimate with a woman, ever. this whole thing is making me cringe and recoil. is it just because I&apos;m not attracted to her? physically? I hope her person has something to do with it too. I hope she has traits that I don&apos;t like and that they are a major reason I don&apos;t reciprocate her attention.</div><div><br/></div><div>she texted me saying she had gotten home but I had already fallen asleep. Krish asked me how it went but didn&apos;t say much when I told him how &quot;uncomfortable&quot; I felt.</div><div><br/></div><div>I even looked up awkward first kiss stories before she got here. in case something wild occurred and I kissed her. I had to know that it&apos;s okay for someone&apos;s first kiss to not be enjoyable.</div><div><br/></div><div>I am going about this all wrong.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>6-19 f</b></div><div><br/></div><div>today is friday and the Kat came over five days ago. I was honest with her and told her that I don&apos;t really like her three days ago. it was a little difficult, as I had never been in such a situation before (what about morgan?), and again if Krish hadn&apos;t urged me I don&apos;t know how long it would have taken me. he seemed exasperated, maybe even a little angry, that I wouldn&apos;t &quot;man up&quot; and be honest with her. I told him that I told her I&apos;m gay and I think he believed me. I found his behavior confusing because I had always told him that I wasn&apos;t attracted to her, but it was he who relentlessly urged me to ask her out. and I&apos;d followed him then too. I still act like a puppy.</div><div><br/></div><div>I wonder how she feels now.</div><div><br/></div><div>the 15-hour drive home is losing its charm now. it&apos;s still fun and exciting to pack a ton of stuff in my car and leave atlanta. just less. I don&apos;t like staying in hotel rooms alone. they make me feel empty again, reminding me that I&apos;m not leaving anything behind, and have nothing to return to. some people are having a party across the hall.</div><div><br/></div><div>at the one rest stop I stopped at, an overweight, raggedy old man approached me and uh oh, what does he want. he&apos;s going to new jersey too. his car broke down and he&apos;s been stranded for over three hours. his wife is six months pregnant. they need gas. I need to use the restroom first. they must not be doing well financially. his car is old and beaten up and his appearance is unkempt. how will they raise a child? I hand him two dollars. not sure how that&apos;s going to help him. maybe could I take them to the next exit, the very next exit off I-85? there&apos;s a gas station and a walmart. they&apos;d sure appreciate it if I could. I look around. I don&apos;t think I can do that. immediately, it&apos;s okay, no hassle. I drive away in my functioning car.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>6-29 m</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Today was my ninth day home.</div><div><br/></div><div>- I would hate to be stuck here for an extended length of time. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m setting myself up for something by saying that. I hope not. Being home drains me of all motivation to do almost anything.</div><div>- I treat my dad rather unfairly. I&apos;m much more comfortable around mom and I&apos;m only just starting to wonder if he notices and how he might feel about that. He&apos;s the family&apos;s main provider and I don&apos;t have a negative relationship with him. But we&apos;re not very close and it feels kind of strained. I can barely even look him in the eye. Why am I like this?</div><div>- Saw Inside Out today and wanted to cry, but had to hold it because my parents were with me (brother refused to join). Didn&apos;t even try to stay through the credits this time. Twenty minutes later, I couldn&apos;t remember at all what was making me want to cry.</div><div>- I think in the future I&apos;ll make a greater effort to go to the movies at a time such that it&apos;ll be dark by the time the movie is over.</div><div>- Got this thought in my head that sounds strange out of context, I&apos;ll never look at 11-year-old girls the same way again.</div><div>- I&apos;ve always liked the idea of thinking of my mind or psyche or whatever as a vast machine, with part of myself (the emotions in the movie) separated from the conscious mind that is me in everyday life. And communicating with my sub-self. Never really had concrete floor plans though. I should develop some.</div><div>- I&apos;m suddenly not so excited to see V anymore. I&apos;m not sure he is to see me either.</div><div>- I spent most of last Friday sick in a hotel bed and didn&apos;t really mind. I didn&apos;t anticipate Niagara Falls to be as touristy as it was. Almost everyone there was either a Chinese or Indian tourist.</div><div>- Kat waited five days to text me a reply that read &quot;Aww&quot;. I don&apos;t understand.</div><div>- On the July 4 holiday all of this will disappear again. And two days later I&apos;ll be back down to face Atlanta again. And I will be all alone. Again.</div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div><b>6-7 t</b></div><div><br/></div><div>I just let thoughts simmer for weeks at a time before finally deciding to write them down and record them somewhere, and by the time I do they&apos;ve evaporated. it&apos;s been three weeks since I got high with alice and the everglow from that is now pretty dim, if it&apos;s still there at all. I don&apos;t really like the term &apos;everglow&apos; very much at all. alice mentioned that she&apos;d get me high way back when I bought her wine at publix, but I don&apos;t remember her saying that then.</div><div><br/></div><div>from christian asking me existential questions (whether a single word/name or a phrase is better as a username) to the guy who random brought a dozen sublime donuts to work for no reason, what christian thinks of me for never driving to the gym and paying for parking, the awkward employees at the shitty design within reach furniture store showroom, something about Richard the property manager for the place I&apos;m moving into.</div><div><br/></div><div>I just checked and it&apos;s been a day over one year since the shenanigans with Kat.</div><div><br/></div><div>last weekend the family came over to help me with the move-in, which never happened and is still ongoing now on my own. they helped me clean and install wood flooring in the bedroom. I got into a brief shouting match with my dad, something I then realized I had dreamt about several times every now and then. it was extremely disappointing to have happen in real life, after all this time. as my mother calmed me down the floodgates budged the tiniest bit and I almost started to cry. by the next morning they were sealed tight again. I was stressed out the entire time they were here because their stuff was everywhere, something I didn&apos;t anticipate having as hard a time dealing with as I did. a significant part of me wanted them gone</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>6-11 s</b></div><div><br/></div><div>last week, christian went to the gym without me, &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE got laid off, and I saw a movie with Bina.</div><div><br/></div><div>he can say what he wants about anything, but his communication still sucks. apparently I was supposed to take his passing mention of leaving for the gym at 11:15 as an official notice. what was going through his head as he left and drove himself there alone. what was he seriously expecting from me? even I would know better than to leave someone in the dark like that. the following he days he seemed to make more of an effort to notify and wait for me, though.</div><div><br/></div><div>on thursday, &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE asked me if I read the news. when I said no, he assumed that I didn&apos;t know about ralph lauren laying off a bunch of workers, and told me that he was one of those let go. I didn&apos;t tell him that I actually did know, from a fashion subreddit post. I can&apos;t remember if I thought about him when I first saw said post. I immediately didn&apos;t know what to say to him or how I could help. I couldn&apos;t imagine that kind of stress, and a part of me is always afraid of the same thing happening to me. he still wanted to play some L4D2, but I was going to see captain america: civil war with Bina. I met up with her at the theater, where the tickets and food I decided to buy cost nearly $30. remind myself to never buy anything to eat from at least that place, ever again. she seemed bored the entire time and after the post-credits scene immediately got up and left. in the row behind us, two couples were cuddling. she didn&apos;t say anything about the movie at all, but still wants to see x-men. I don&apos;t know if I want to bring her along with alice.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>6-19 n</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>nearly a solid half of the year is over now, and I can&apos;t remember anything. all I have are the pictures I took. depression may be a cause, but this is exactly why I need pictures and music so much. without them, I won&apos;t be able to remember anything, as no events have occurred. with them, I&apos;m barely able to recall a color.</div><div><br/></div><div>missed it by a few days, but it was a certain kind of two-year anniversary for me (not with a person). I look back at my pictures and music and stuff I ordered, and things seem so recent and simultaneously impossibly long ago. a month is now the standard unit of time. I&apos;m doing my best to appreciate the present, remaining time in my apartment before I leave. the ghostly empty spaces and what used to be there. nothing. I was thinking yesterday about everybody having different universes and histories and soundtracks to accompany them, and realized again that there&apos;s nothing special about mine, and that in fact mine is far more boring than most other people&apos;s. even if I could share it, no one would want to be a part of it.</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s taken over two weeks to empty out most of the &quot;inessential&quot; in my focus on living a couple weeks in a bare minimalist room, and there&apos;s no time left to enjoy it. there&apos;s still plenty more to move anyways.</div><div><br/></div><div>last week the qa person Karen kept flashing peace signs at me in the hallway, to which I didn&apos;t respond. she annoys me for some reason. she asked me if I&apos;m alright, and I said, &quot;yeah.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>I skipped my friday workout to eat greasy chinese food instead, with Dave, Ben, and Bobby. Bobby was talking about his fiance when Dave turned to me and asked if I had a girlfriend, telling me to get on it before I even answered. it must be really obvious.</div><div><br/></div><div>I want to get high with alice again, but bina keeps insisting on seeing the new x-men movie with me. I don&apos;t know why, and I didn&apos;t enjoy her company very much when watching civil war. alice has been non-responsive and I&apos;m not taking initiative anymore. if she doesn&apos;t contact me today then I&apos;ll have to go with bina.</div><div><br/></div><div>the earth is not a cold dead place</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s been just about exactly a year since I left for home for my summer trip last year. the time was permeated with whatever unique blend I had going on in my head then, and a lot of life is strange and the emotions it wrought. an entire year. it&apos;s the last of the single-anniversary events. from now one one year becomes two, and then it will become three, and things will keep going just like that. what could make you feel more powerless than knowing you can&apos;t stop that?</div><div><br/></div><div>6:50 pm</div><div><br/></div><div>I just got back from watching x-men apocalypse with bina. no word from alice.</div><div><br/></div><div>the girl driving the audi a4</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>6-22 w</b></div><div><br/></div><div>there are only seven days remaining. including today. of my time here in my first apartment. I&apos;m leaving this here. I feel nothing.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>6-28 t</b></div><div><br/></div><div>we have come now full circle for the second time. my habits are tectonic plates, shaking up everything as they gradually shift. the old continents are forgotten with the rest of this world as it disappears. I wanted but couldn&apos;t pay attention to the last of everything. my last shower. my last laundry load. my last parking on the side of the street. my last package pickup. my last night here. I think 2014 is longer ago than I realize. tomorrow I&apos;ll need to pack up my remaining things and leave forever.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>6-30 r</b></div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m having more and more trouble drawing with words.</div><div><br/></div><div>as much as I want it to feel like the end of some kind of era yesterday, it just didn&apos;t. I had already decided to take the day off so I could take my time moving my remaining things. woke up at 7 and shopped online. that leather wallet I&apos;d been eyeing was sold out. texted Bina asking her to tell everyone at the office that I wouldn&apos;t be there instead of awkwardly emailing Marty. it was past 11 when I finally decided to get up. as always I underestimated the amount of things I had left and how long it would take me to get ready. picked up my laptop off the floor (still playing CrazyShootin&apos;s trolling Amnesia monsters videos on a loop nonstop), put my sheets in the washer, folded up the futon. by the time I had my car loaded for trip one, it was about 2:30. I was only barely almost panicking, but it reminded me of the few dreams I&apos;ve had where I need to pack up and leave for somewhere and I&apos;m pressed for time and frantically running around.</div><div><br/></div><div>the moveout inspection person showed up about half an hour after I got back, with nearly everything else loaded at that point. I started to take off my shoes before stepping onto the carpet before I remembered that I didn&apos;t need to anymore, nor would it make sense to. he pointed out only a few problems, which I already knew would be, so they weren&apos;t unexpected. it was still going to take me multiple trips to carry the stuff left, so he left me with a lockbox to leave the key in, asked me questions about where I went to school and where I work for some reason, and was on his way, thanking me for keeping the unit in good condition.</div><div><br/></div><div>I wandered around the empty rooms for a while, taking pictures of the carpet impressions that my desk left behind. trying to think about all the time I had spent here, even though there was really nothing that stands out as memorable. it&apos;s just that it was my space for a while, and I made it my home, for what that&apos;s worth. nothing special whatsoever to everyone except me. that&apos;s what really sucks. that all this means so much, but only to me. only to me.</div><div><br/></div><div>I want to say that I felt sad, but if I did it was only a little bit. I have to try really hard to feel something. in actuality I&apos;m mostly in denial that I&apos;ll likely never return here and can&apos;t ever revisit it. I don&apos;t know when or how I&apos;ll adjust to the new place, and can&apos;t foresee it happening. but it has to.</div><div><br/></div><div>I simply packed up and left.</div><div><br/></div><div>a slew of anniversaries passing without my noticing.</div><div><br/></div><div>one year ago I was at home with my family and we went on a trip to canada (actually niagara falls), during which I got sick with a fever. images of last summer include life is strange, meundies, beautiful agony, jackthreads, the casio keyboard, toccata and fugue bvw 565, Kat, and Krish. soon it&apos;ll be a year since he and I fell out.</div><div><br/></div><div>and one year will become two.</div><div><br/></div><div>up next: the office, until dawn, and all that&apos;s encapsulated in a sea of split peas and folding leaves.</div><div><br/></div><div>I continuously think about how I would give anything to just relive the past few months. I&apos;ll pay more attention this time. I&apos;ll not waste energy on frivolous things this time. and this is still not able to get me to focus on the present Now.</div><div><br/></div><div>I can&apos;t remember anything from this entire year so far. there&apos;s usually at least a color. with few pictures and little music to paint with, I don&apos;t even have that this year.</div><div><br/></div><div>when I said to Bina that I&apos;m sad about leaving my old place, she confusedly asked, &quot;why?&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>I didn&apos;t know what to do when I woke up this morning. everything out of place, unsorted clutter, foreign environment. I just stood and stared for a while, not aware of where I was. the drive to work felt a little surreal. I couldn&apos;t believe what I was doing. if I felt this way in 2014, and I&apos;m certain I did, I don&apos;t remember it.</div><div><br/></div><div>as stupid as I find some of christian&apos;s behaviors, I still must be grateful for him for providing just a little bit extra motivation at the gym. although part of it is that it would just be awkward for me if I don&apos;t do what he tells me to. maybe he likes being a &quot;coach&quot; for someone. I don&apos;t know why he&apos;s helping me so when I never pay for parking. for the first time I toyed with the idea of paying it all back to him some time in the future when we&apos;re no longer working together.</div><div><br/></div><div>is it a problem when considering the fact we&apos;re all going to die brings me comfort more often than not?</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div>6-5 m</div><div><br/></div><div>I keep thinking about that Alexis from eats and I've dreamt about her now. and last night I had a dream about one of the girls I've seen several times at the chick fil-a drive-thru window, the one whose fingers accidentally brushed against mine once. in the dream we were wandering around an old supermarket/department store, and I nonchalantly asked her out, but she appeared uninterested.</div><div><br/></div><div>the loneliness is taking hold of me again. I continue to hide behind expensive clothing. I've been messaging my mom more about how I feel, but today my dad told me to tell him instead, because I'm making her worry too much.</div><div><hr/></div><div>6-6 t</div><div><br/></div><div>the girl at the chick fil-a was taking orders outside today so I saw her again. I don't even know her name. christian remarked on how cute she is and casually said that I should try and go for it. it's like he read my thoughts.</div><div><br/></div><div>maybe that &quot;experiment&quot; I tried in mid-2015 is worth repeating.<br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>6-9 f</div><div><br/></div><div>this morning the freaking usps lady asked me if I'm doing alright. then if I'm taking the day off. I wasn't sure if she recognized me, as I've been to this location several times now. this sort of thing has qualified as a meaningful interaction for some time.</div><div><br/></div><div>the cute chick fil-a girl recognized chris but none of them who recognize him recognize me, since I'm the one just sitting in the passenger side while he does the talking. I was barely jealous.</div><div><br/></div><div>he asked me about shopping debt and confessed some of his impulsive shopping habits, and also mentioned not being taught to manage money well by his parents. does this count as some sort of opening up? I don't know.<br/></div><div><hr/>6-24 s</div><div><br/></div><div>the anniversaries have become blurred. I do what I can to make the preparations on the day I leave the least stressful I can, but somehow I always end up dragging it out. it's nearly noon and I still need to eat before I leave for home again. the third sojourn since moving. I didn't even decide on this date until barely two weeks earlier. there's no fanfare anymore. and I struggle to write something down for me to remember later.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>I'm at the midpoint now, after having left even later than I did last winter, arriving at nearly midnight. I know it's supposed to get shorter, but still. I thought about home and wondered how many more times I'll be able to go back to it, where my parents are. when it will end and everything will move on. because I got here so late, the hotel parking was almost entirely full and I had to park in a spot in the back of the building.<br/></div><div><hr/>6-26 m</div><div><br/></div><div>day 1 of 12, after a particularly grueling second leg of the journey. although I managed an alternate route this time, and mostly without gps. I always give in to the urges to take so many pictures.</div><div><br/></div><div>I notified DOOGIE that I'd be up here and he immediately wanted to meet up again. the ball always feels like it's in my court, but it's really just an illusion. I think I'd be afraid to ask, and want to react the way I imagine others would to me if I were to ask them.</div><div><br/></div><div>I was so excited to have my fridge cleared out and spaces emptied, doing my best to ignore that I'd be right back there in two weeks.<br/></div><div><hr/>6-28 w</div><div><br/></div><div>so far the summer line is being defined by obsessing over this time's products, DOOGIE nagging me to go to new york, a rash that's spreading throughout my arms and legs, re-wearing previously left behind clothing, a pair of speakers I set up by my bed, and some improvements I've made such as wearing my own pair of flip flops in the bathroom, flossing downstairs, and using a properly sized washcloth.<br/></div><div><hr/>6-30 f</div><div><br/></div><div>before I wait too long, again:</div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday was memorable for two reasons, wicked and DOOGIE. I was uncomfortable going in because of the rash that continued to spread all over me, and wearing uncomfortable pants and shoes whose colors didn't match well. the bus almost skipped me and I had to run after it, waving. I got tired towards the end of the ride and it was cold. as we approached the city I recognized 432 park avenue in the city skyline.</div><div><br/></div><div>I waited for DOOGIE a block away from the theatre, at a starbucks. apparently I hadn't been clear enough about my availability timeframe with him, and he thought I'd have less time to spend with him than I actually did. we ended up going instead to a 7-eleven just a bit further up the street, where he bought me a cheesy 7-pepper sausage for me. it was $2.22 for it and a drink. the cups were large and he filled his with ginger ale while I filled mine halfway. we just stood in an aisle eating, he devouring his dog in a minute (he hadn't eaten all day, he said). I didn't want to stay inside this shitty 7-eleven so I went out and headed back toward the theatre, DOOGIE in tow.</div><div><br/></div><div>I didn't and don't appreciate the city enough.</div><div><br/></div><div>my parents and brother left later than I did, since I'd decided to meet with DOOGIE beforehand. we stood outside the theatre entrance for about an hour, just talking. I get the impression that his charisma is learned rather than natural. despite my negative perceptions, he's never made me feel uncomfortable around him, but there were still some semi-awkward moments when our thoughts didn't mesh.</div><div><br/></div><div>I don't know if he's been single his whole life (I know I'm subconsciously hoping so) but the way he talks about girls makes me uncomfortable only because of my own lack of confidence. he kept making comments on, and asking for my opinions of, various girls streaming into the theatre. telling me about his preferences (nice legs, no taller than three inches shorter) and asking me if I'd date girl X. perhaps it was crude...? but that's not what bothered me. I should know by now that it's standard talk. I think the last time it was ever a normal topic of conversation for me was with krish. and that was over long ago. many of the girls were dressed up in dresses. DOOGIE pointed out some asian ones, one of whom he described as &quot;carries herself well.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>it's a basic and easy-to-dissect insecurity.</div><div><br/></div><div>he also shared some stories about a couple different girls whom he tried to get to know better, who all stopped responding to him. I kept looking at him and trying to imagine any girl wanting to be with him. I told myself that I'd feel better if I were wearing better clothes.</div><div><br/></div><div>he told me a story that I found strange, about how he needed his passport to make a copy of for his new employer, but his mom has it locked up somewhere, and not only is he unable to access it, but he doesn't even know where it is. he seemed to not understand why I thought it strange that he doesn't have his own passport on hand.</div><div><br/></div><div>my parents and brother were late to the show and they had all the tickets with them. so my brother sent me a picture of one of them. I waited until a few minutes after the show began and was allowed inside with the photo. bid DOOGIE an abrupt good-bye. I had to stand in a hall for a short while and watch the intro on a small screen before being escorted inside. so I didn't catch part of the beginning. in fact I was feeling disinterested in the musical altogether, having little idea of what it was about.</div><div><br/></div><div>it quickly changed though as I picked up the wizard of oz references and heard how amazing this actress's voice was. it began to affect me in ways similar to how the phantom of the opera did. I was very tentatively watching it creep up inside me...I need to learn to be okay with being affected this way. it could be something else internal...</div><div><br/></div><div>it was more humorous and energetic than the phantom as I recall. as it ended, I once again fell victim to the dreaded, all too familiar wistfulness brought on by the supplemental empathy and illusory nostalgia. I never have anyone to share it with and am left holding within myself this energy, helplessly watching as it dies.</div><div><br/></div><div>I don't know exactly how upset DOOGIE is with me for refusing to meet up with him a second time today. he had some &quot;gig&quot; in mind with other friends that included dinner and music. while I myself found it fantastic just how persistent he was, I'm thinking it was a mistake to look at it so condescendingly. this was yet another opportunity that I lost...if this was the last one he gives, I've no right to be surprised.</div><div><br/></div><div>I think I'll add the wicked soundtrack to my life's.<br/></div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">6-1 f</span></div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;ve disabled my tinder for now and the plan is to keep it off until I take some better pictures of myself.</div><div><br/></div><div>I had a better than usual time at three dollar cafe after work today with the rest of them. Danny actually called me to make sure I was coming. there, he asked me about progress on the millennium falcon again. Anthony overheard and could not believe that I spent over $800 on a lego set. Rashida sat down next to me and we had our conversation about infinity war after all. I put my scripted lines to good use. she asked me some more about myself and my family. we ended up making plans to see &apos;a quiet place&apos; some time next week. it was rather easy talking to her.</div><div><br/></div><div>after she left, I hovered around Anthony and Blessed as they shot the shit. I&apos;m glad that I&apos;ve been getting along with Blessed pretty easily so far, and I think I&apos;m becoming more okay around Anthony too. Anthony said that Kumar is one of the most brilliant people he knows, and I didnt like hearing that. what makes him so brilliant when his code is such shit?</div><div><br/></div><div>earlier in the office, Aaron was opening a new asus laptop and I heard him pronounce the name &quot;ay-suss&quot; while talking to Blessed. I took the opportunity to correct him, &quot;a-seuss,&quot; but he was adamant in his pronunciation until Blessed came along and agreed with me.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">6-3 n</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>sundays are the most depressing. lethargic, I stay inside all day, get nothing done.</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s now been about two years since I moved into my current apartment. the second two years passed mind-numbingly quickly compared to the first two. I&apos;ll keep saying it until it becomes three.</div><div><br/></div><div>Jacob says &quot;good&quot; every time I attempt a triangle.</div><div><br/></div><div>dinner with the current crew yesterday went fine. Cody for whatever reason offered to carpool. the place was in the same plaza as the h-mart I went to with Nita one time. David showed up late, apparently because he had fallen asleep before coming here. Cody and I agreed that his messages in the group chats seem rather scattered. ever since rejoining after &quot;dropping out,&quot; he&apos;s actually been more actively participating. tried not to get too jealous of the attention Dorothy kept giving Cody, just accepting that it wasn&apos;t mine to have.</div><div><br/></div><div>we all went to a crowded bubble tea place next door, where we stood outside and talked yet again about the Ben. for at least an hour, telling the same stories that we all already know. this time including his friends, the Ai-Ping, and a Nancy, the 25-year-old girl with whom the Ben lives. apparently he doesn&apos;t want anyone to know that he&apos;s letting her live in his house. Dorothy speculates that she&apos;s paying him absurdly low rent or no rent at all, and that he&apos;s embarrassed about that. she also recounted some more stories about him that did help me understand why she was so mad towards him at the camping trip. and brought up the idea that he&apos;s not as clueless as he may seem. I think it&apos;s funny that we give this guy so much of our attention.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">6-4 m</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;d been wondering what would happen if I were ever the only person to show up to the bjj class. that happened today. and nothing happened, because Jacob said he couldn&apos;t &quot;drill&quot; with me because of his jaw. which isn&apos;t a new problem if I recall correctly, because I remember Hannah telling me something about it long ago. plus I&apos;ve seen him practice plenty of times with the other people. it sounded like a cheap excuse to me, to avoid having to spend a class period with just me. I didn&apos;t want to potentially call him out on anything in front of the other guys he was talking with. I stood off to the side and browsed instagram for ten minutes before walking up to him again. he looked up at me and kept apologizing. I was slightly worried about what the others were thinking of me.</div><div><br/></div><div>afterwards I briefly messaged Hannah about it and hopefully I didn&apos;t give her too much of my attention.</div><div><br/></div><div>I don&apos;t like the way I look in this striped t-shirt I initially bought nearly three years ago.</div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">6-6 w</span></div><div><br/></div><div>sure enough, Dorothy&apos;s included the Ben and the new &quot;NanCy&quot; in a messaging group for her pool party next weekend. I wonder if Ben has any clue about the reason Dorothy invited him. what it must be like to have such a standing among a group. I feel a little bit less anxious now, a little less of that feeling like a burden, a nuisance.</div><div><br/></div><div>the company/Anthony bought Blessed a 40&quot; 4k monitor that arrived today. maybe that would make him feel better about staying. maybe he has plans to leave sometime soon. today he sent a piece of &quot;interesting code&quot; that he found, and messaged me saying that &quot;this code base is for real a career ending proposition.&quot; that rooted the idea even more firmly in my head. if I want to Progress In My Career, I can&apos;t stay here.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m having to use more willpower each week to force myself into the bjj class. it&apos;s like I&apos;m steadily becoming more disillusioned with it. this morning I sent Hannah a picture of the mcqueen sweater I ended up buying, and you&apos;d almost think from her reply that she had a small meltdown. in class today she almost seemed legitimately angry, telling Jacob about my &quot;stupid-ass&quot; sweater. he asked me why I would buy a sweater in the summer and was then absolutely astounded that it was (over) $400. the other guys couldn&apos;t *not* hear his outburst, and I&apos;m sure they all see me in a different light after that. maybe they think I&apos;m a rich snob. if Hannah actually is angry with me, I don&apos;t really care because I didn&apos;t do anything to personally wrong her. I don&apos;t know what her situation is with her John and she sure as hell won&apos;t tell me now.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">6-7 r</span></div><div><br/></div><div>Hannah messaged me again asking if I&apos;m going to class. I guess she somehow knew no one else would be there? she&apos;s only going if I&apos;m going. somehow that made me decide not to go. I made a lot of quips that she replied LOL to, and she likes to state when something I say makes her laugh. that&apos;s a good thing, right? that I make her laugh. I don&apos;t know her status with her John and don&apos;t know if it would be appropriate in any case to make some kind of move. I wish I knew.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;ve been taking what I feel are risks while talking to her. sometimes I&apos;m afraid of offending her, but just say what I want to anyway. I made some comment about her &quot;losing&quot; her bike that she didn&apos;t respond to, but then when I restarted the conversation she semi-asked to hang out later. I tried to see if she&apos;d be willing to come over instead, and she wasn&apos;t. should I try inviting her to Dorothy&apos;s pool party on saturday?</div><div><br/></div><div>after a two-month hiatus, &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE and I played a game of L4D2 again.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">6-9 s</span></div><div><br/></div><div>whatever happens in the bjj class is not important. I guess I&apos;ll have to hold out for this first year of membership, but after that, if I&apos;m still interested, I want to move on to somewhere else. maybe I shouldn&apos;t opened up to Hannah about how I really feel towards Jacob and Mallory.</div><div><br/></div><div>the desperate search for signs. she &quot;chose&quot; the pool party I invited her to instead of one of the other four invitations she got. she&apos;s willing to spend the time with me despite me having said all the things I said that I&apos;d been worried about. after class we went to kroger together and bought our contributions. then she came over and I let her shower at my place. she complimented my apartment, telling me it was clean, minimalist and that it was one of the nicer ones she&apos;s seen. I didn&apos;t make the planned joke about showering together. I let her fill up my car&apos;s gas tank on the way.</div><div><br/></div><div>occurrences at the pool. I entered it but there was no point in swimming much. I hang around Hannah every now and then. I ask her to &quot;take a candid of me just chilling&quot; but I don&apos;t like the angle she took the picture from and didn&apos;t ask her again. I put on her aviator sunglasses and she says it&apos;s a good look on me. the new Andrew, whom we all just met earlier this morning, talked to me a little bit, but he was so quiet around just me that I could barely hear him. David makes a strange comment about Hannah and I dating. I don&apos;t remember the exact nature of what he said but I remember he asked if Hannah and I were a couple. she immediately answered no, and so did I. then I quickly tried to make another joke about it but failed, possibly unveiling to her what I&apos;m really thinking. it begins thundering and raining and we leave the pool to go inside, where Hannah cuts the watermelon and we watch bridesmaids.</div><div><br/></div><div>after it gets dark out, we regroup outside and sit around the poolside fireplace. Cody leaves first, not counting those who left while we were watching the movie.</div><div><br/></div><div>there&apos;s nothing there.</div><div><br/></div><div>Hannah repeatedly refers to her &quot;girl friend&quot; and I think she&apos;s referring to Mallory.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">6-10 n</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>after going back inside, most of the rest of them leave while David, Heather, Dorothy, Hannah and I sit in her living room where I ended up listen to them talk about relationships and computer science careers until about 1 am. Dorothy sits next to me and compliments my shirt. Hannah continues to readily open up to people about the details of what she&apos;s going through with her John. I think David and Dorothy&apos;s opinions and advice reinforce what she&apos;s probably heard a lot of already. David gets to the point, asking if they&apos;ve slept together considering that John&apos;s hesitation towards committing to a relationship with her apparently stems from his christian faith. I believe when Hannah says yes, they&apos;ve done it, is the point when David tells her to run. the impact from that sort of blow has lessened by now. Hannah seems to acknowledge that it would make sense for her to split, but admits that her feelings for him are getting in the way.</div><div><br/></div><div>on the way back I tell her that I too think she&apos;s a catch. as I drop her off at the corner of her block she invites me to &quot;hang out&quot; even more, but I decline. she tells me to message her when I get home so she knows I&apos;m safe.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>sundays are the most depressing.</div><div><br/></div><div>whatever I&apos;ve been doing has definitely landed me in that dreaded zone with Hannah. she keeps messaging me about what she&apos;s thinking about doing about John. she&apos;s been back on tinder for a week and already has a date lined up. I think she kind of asked me to be her &quot;safety net&quot;? still, she seemed somewhat eager to help me with my own profile, offering up a photographer friend to take some pictures. I am now attached to that hope. ideally, something good would still come of this.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">6-11 m</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>the Gorm is in town again for at least this week.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m experiencing some anxiety again and much of it is coming from jiu-jitsu. thinking about my constant discomfort there with just about every person involved. I don&apos;t like the Angel, and maybe he doesn&apos;t care about me but is able to perceive my negative vibe, causing him to view me negatively too. Hannah made another facebook group with a few of the other people in the class. I don&apos;t like the fact that she&apos;s okay with them all while I&apos;m not. it&apos;s discomfort that I am actively avoiding. this is me walking away with my tail between my legs.</div><div><br/></div><div>I am able to recognize ongoing attacks now. I become more sensitive to others&apos; words. casual conversation between the rest of them becomes annoying. I see them having a good time with themselves and feel so distant and alien. I think about how this job with this terrible codebase isn&apos;t helping me or my Career, how I&apos;m always distracting myself and stagnating. while people Hannah are surely soaring high above me.</div><div><br/></div><div>in other news, I asked alice if I could get some weed from her.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">6-15 f</span></div><div><br/></div><div>why will I be up writing so late today? well this time it&apos;s to chronicle a parallel to almost this exact date three years ago. I did not expect this to happen. Barb put out an invitation to dinner into her running group chat. I was okay with dinner with her and any others. but it was just the two of us. we informally agreed to fellini&apos;s, the first place that had popped into mind. neither of us updated the other on our whereabouts but there was no need, I found her just fine. I greeted her with, &quot;how&apos;ve you been, buddy?&quot; we side hugged. we ate our pizza and talked about stuff. she&apos;d think of some question to ask me whenever it fell silent. we had some common ground for a little bit on barcelona. turns out that&apos;s where she was for the last couple weeks. she was wearing a flowery dress. she said that I seem to be in good shape, but I didn&apos;t make the &quot;hot&quot; joke here either.</div><div><br/></div><div>the high&apos;s almost completely worn off now.</div><div><br/></div><div>she&apos;s the one who bluntly asks, want to smoke weed? she doesn&apos;t have a bowl, and we do indeed go to that smoke shop I first discovered that night after David&apos;s dinner. I pick up a random &quot;bubbler&quot; and a plastic grinder. Barb reminds me that I don&apos;t even have a lighter, surprising the shop employee. she pays for the lighter.</div><div><br/></div><div>I start driving to my place without declaring anything, just assuming that we&apos;d agreed on that because we certainly weren&apos;t going to her place. oh that&apos;s right, I&apos;m letting her into my space because she had already allowed us into hers. I kept thinking about her questions being &quot;shit tests&quot;. about how I didn&apos;t have the energy to bother dodging them, if any. I wasn&apos;t invested, figuring she just wanted to smoke some weed. I wasn&apos;t wanting, expecting, or hoping for anything at all...and I still sink and get stuck in my head. everything I said, everything I did was stupid. I vacuumed the area underneath the couch after moving it so we could sit by the window. I put on kraftwerk, which didn&apos;t work for me. everything was a mess. I wasn&apos;t sure how to use the simple &quot;equipment&quot; that I&apos;d just bought. I&apos;m sure my lack of confidence and decisiveness showed. it sucks knowing that if I were trying for me, I would not have gotten anywhere close.</div><div><br/></div><div>she asks me questions like what&apos;s on my bucket list? suggested a game like never have i ever or 20 questions. I was too anxious for those. she tells me to tell her a story, and I end up lamely telling the one about the portraits we tread dangerously close to Kat territory when we get up to look up youtube videos. I show her &apos;room 8&apos; and a few other old short movies. she showed me one too. she had told me she likes scary movies and I said we should watch alien together. but this time, I knew that I didn&apos;t really mean it.</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s a couple hours of nothing. I get a little bit high and she presumably does too. her questions just to keep it alive. sitting next to her, afraid to even look at her. she has her arms crossed and I keep moving my feet around the windowsill. so. stupid.</div><div><br/></div><div>I poorly relayed my concerns to petunia, who repeatedly reassured me that everything is going to be okay.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">6-16 s</span></div><div><br/></div><div>I had resigned myself to simply not care about what the JP thinks of me. always talking to me with that condescending smile. it makes me dislike him. until I think about my own opinion towards the (work) Ben, as well as the way the other ops guys seem to treat Aaron. there&apos;s just something about being too soft and nice that makes people look down on you.</div><div><br/></div><div>at first, the JP seemed to think that I had brought nothing with me for the potluck on thursday, saying, &quot;you&apos;re good&quot; while laughing to himself. because I had left the box of cupcakes I&apos;d bought that morning in my car instead of walking into the office with it. when I did bring it in and the others saw, though, they seemed impressed. I was relieved. I think the JP was still making fun of me because he quoted that old &quot;damn daniel&quot; meme. I spent nearly $40 on just a dozen cupcakes.</div><div><br/></div><div>alice decided to reply much more promptly to my text asking to buy weed from her. well would you look at that. I was asking because of Dorothy, and alice ended up picking up later that same day. I drove late at night to the building she lives in now, which I think is where Krish lived three years ago. I parked right out front by the door and got out when I saw her come out. but she said, &quot;let&apos;s get in your car&quot; and it took me a second to realize that no, we weren&apos;t going anywhere. she asked me, &quot;how&apos;ve you been, buddy?&quot; in an almost sweet, genuine way, that I&apos;m going to borrow in the future. I paid her with venmo and she handed the bag to me and immediately left. a few minutes later I noticed that the edibles she said she&apos;d include weren&apos;t there, but she shamelessly refused to come down a second time and I was only persistent for a few messages before giving up.</div><div><br/></div><div>on friday I wore the same floral shirt that I wore to the pool party last week and it kept getting compliments. I kept overthinking my responses to those compliments. first I sparred with Richard and came up with a natural response. then Blessed told me he liked it and for some reason I said, &quot;everyone does&quot; which was a stupid thing to say. later in the day Aaron asked me, &quot;is the ceiling interesting?&quot; when he saw me looking up as I was stretching my neck, and I stuttered while replying, &quot;why don&apos;t you have a look?&quot; which was a stupid thing to say. the RJ laughed while shaking his head. he and the other ops guys seem to always be passively condescending when they talk to Aaron. I don&apos;t agree with it, but I can see why they do that. I wonder if this is an example manifestation of &quot;you train others how to treat you.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>everyone goes out to three dollar cafe again and I leave late, only after running out of material to waste time reading. Anthony tells RJ, Aaron, and Richard about my $800 lego set. Aaron tells me he hopes it&apos;s a lego death star, but I say it&apos;s a giant dick and everyone laughs. before I left I had texted Danny to order some tater tots, but the service was so slow that by the time I left over half an hour later, they still hadn&apos;t come. Danny had left before I arrived, and for some reason he told me that an Elena would be there later. she&apos;s the woman with that other company sitting in the back of the office, who I think is kind of hot. RJ and I make some jokes about me owning balenciaga clothing, and I see him looking up some balenciaga product on his phone. as I leave, Aaron reminds me once more that they all give me shit because they like me.</div><div><br/></div><div>dinner at fellini&apos;s with Barb who ends up coming over to smoke pot and for nothing else.</div><div><br/></div><div>true to her word, she was present at the run this morning. but there was little to no followup to last night and we didn&apos;t talk much. I tried to focus on just being relaxed and comfortable around her, closer to the level I can reach with Hannah. but there&apos;s just nothing that comes to mind to say to her. if there is, it&apos;s always blocked. I stayed behind with her, Jay, and Cody, just sitting outside on the second floor of jason&apos;s deli. I didn&apos;t talk very much.</div><div><br/></div><div>today, I skipped the fifth bjj class in a row. I wonder if they talk or think about me, but I don&apos;t care. I know I&apos;m avoiding it because it&apos;s frustrating to me and the people there make me anxious because they&apos;re stronger than me. what is the reason that my attitude towards the Angel is different from my attitude towards the Mallory, when they both treat me similarly?</div><div><br/></div><div>I will declare today, june 16, to be the official anniversary date of the day I started living on my own, and this one marks four years now. all the other anniversaries have melted. they barely remain fresh for a single year.</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s been several days since I had this dream, but it was one of the feel-good dreams where I experience that rare contentment. it starts off in some kind of retreat or getaway in the woods with a group, whose members I don&apos;t recall. i enter a large house and when i exit, i see several bodies lying around. i realize that someone is massacring the group, and pick up some sharp kitchen knives to attack and defend. someone comes at me with one; he cuts the back of leg near the tendon behind the knee, but i manage to slice his throat and kill him. we ultimately lose the battle and the next scene i remember is in a shared shower in some kind of concentration camp. the walls are frosted glass. i&apos;m with a girl with long, slightly curly/wavy hair. we stand naked together under the shower as i massage her head. her eyes are closed and we&apos;re cherishing this moment together because we don&apos;t know what will happen next. some guards walk down the hallway towards the shower, and we separate before they step in, so they don&apos;t see us.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>I might as well update some since it&apos;s already late.</div><div><br/></div><div>joining the same crew as this morning, I went to go see a horror movie. it was a satisfyingly creepy movie. I sat between Jay and Barb with Cody on Barb&apos;s other side, and I think I saw him with his hand on her leg or something during a scary scene. as much as I&apos;d like to think nothing of it, I couldn&apos;t. and it&apos;s weird because I&apos;m not obsessed with Barb or anything. while walking towards the middle of atlantic station, we bumped into Hannah. she gave me a side hug.</div><div><br/></div><div>afterwards we went to a bar in the same plaza as the one where ormsby&apos;s is. where I stood and exchanged an occasional bit with whoever. Barb and Cody seemed to be getting closer. I wanted to be part of it, but that&apos;s not something you can ask for. the anxiety is ruthless whenever I let my thoughts settle on this.</div><div><br/></div><div>apparently one of the guys in a group next to us spanked Barb&apos;s butt when she was standing next to them. a short girl among them apologized, trying to defuse. they disappeared but reappeared nearby outside some time later after we went outside. it had pissed Cody off and he told me he stared intently at the girl as we walked past them on our way out, and that he could see the fear in her eyes. I thought it was appropriate. I had nothing to add to the conversation about why a guy would do something like that to a girl, when she&apos;s with her friends no less. so I didn&apos;t really say anything. Cody and Barb hugged, but I stayed where I was because I didn&apos;t want any sort of pity hug.</div><div><br/></div><div>I feel bad.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">6-19 t</span></div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m not sure exactly how much I like/dislike Ben from work. His weak voice and silly demeanor annoy me. how has he been married for 11 years with 3 kids? I&apos;m reminded again of how my own voice and immature behaviors can come across to other people. although, I&apos;m sure the others in the office get along with Ben just fine, differently from how they do with Aaron and maybe me.</div><div><br/></div><div>as I think back to the emotional overtones from the earlier years&apos; phases, I can see how they all feel younger, more naive.</div><div><br/></div><div>Hannah messaged me again just now and it seemed to be just to talk about her John again. responding to her feels so much easier and more natural than responding to Barb, who just makes me anxious even though I&apos;m not trying to get with either of them. I can&apos;t tell if Hannah is just using me, but I don&apos;t want to upset her with my non-serious responses either. she said she was drinking in her apartment with John over, and I&apos;m curious as to why.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">6-20 w</span></div><div><br/></div><div>I think I&apos;m beginning to find comfort in things again. new shoes, new shirts. I can&apos;t picture myself wearing them, but they&apos;re new and I like just having them. until I don&apos;t.</div><div><br/></div><div>lunch happned with Zach, Blessed, and the Ben today. the Ben still annoys me with his slow speech and constant smiling at me as though I just said something stupid. I made a comment about most continents being bigger than america after he said something using the word &apos;continents&apos; when the word &apos;countries&apos; would have made more sense. he said I seemed angry when I corrected him. perhaps I came across as angry when I didn&apos;t mean to.</div><div><br/></div><div>blessed asked what my dashcam was. apparently he had never heard of such a concept before, and found it laughable. at lunch he was blunt with Zach about his smoking habit and how the smell of cigarette smoke follows him. Ben was able to relate to Zach regarding how difficult it is to quit smoking. I learned that apparently the Aaron is leaving the company, some time next week?</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m falling deeper still into that undesirable hole with Hannah. yesterday she told me that despite all the &quot;shit&quot; she&apos;s been through with her John, he still makes her &quot;stupidly happy&quot;. he was over at her place, to pick up his stuff? and she drank enough to make her still feel slightly sick two days later. maybe she wanted to have sex with him one more time. she keeps updating me on the status of their relationship. what am I, and how did I get here?</div><div><br/></div><div>I can only wonder what you have to do and be to make a girl feel that way about you. some red pill shit? everything I&apos;m not. instead, I&apos;m low key asking her for help on dating apps like tinder and okcupid. I&apos;ve already willingly told her that I&apos;ve never had a relationship with anyone. I mentioned to her that she&apos;s gone on more dates in the past week than I have in my life. seeking some kind of validation. from her. that&apos;s even more pathetic than I had already realized.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">6-23 s</span></div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s not often that I let myself go as far as I did last night, but here we go.</div><div><br/></div><div>I arrived at the daiquiri factory at least an hour after everyone else, because of traffic in the uber. the driver might have been new to the app. her car was not messy but dirty, and smelled a tiny bit like weed. she tried to start a conversation a couple times, and mentioned that eleven 45 club down the street from me. mumbled to herself a few times. now I know how I must look when I&apos;m mumbling under my breath like that.</div><div><br/></div><div>Zach was the first to see me and called out to me. I had changed into shorts and was wearing my light blue common projects. within five seconds of me walking over to the table, Ben accidentally knocked some food bits off and some of hit my shoe. he awkwardly apologized several times, which I basically ignored. I had to fine tune my pissed look so that he could tell, but not feel like I&apos;d hold a grudge against him. Rashida noticed that I went inside to get water to clean my shoes, and said this is why she likes me.</div><div><br/></div><div>the rain began to fall so half of us head indoors while the other half leave. the service was terribly slow and Anthony looked pissed. oddly, Aaron and the others kept complaining about the heat, while I for once actually felt fine. we ordered a few pitchers of one of the slush flavors and I started drinking. Blessed told me that he had only been to two strip clubs, and both times he got horny enough to fuck one of the girls there. he was so paranoid about STDs that he put on five condoms.</div><div><br/></div><div>apparently the daiquiri factory is a gay bar. and Rashida is lesbian? I remember Anthony mentioning her saying something about her sexuality during her interview, but never pieced it together. I sat by Anthony, RJ, Zach, and Blessed, while Aaron was off to the side by himself for a while. sweating and looking uncomfortable. Blessed talked a little bit to two girls who were sitting at a nearby table; turns out they were married to each other. Anthony began talking to Aaron about his weight problems again. they don&apos;t beat around the bush, as I found when Anthony gave him a bit of shit about a time he had several packs of skittles &quot;for breakfast&quot;.</div><div><br/></div><div>we moved back outside and the conversation turned towards our codebase. Anthony&apos;s not exactly pleased with our setup either. I listened as Blessed railed at the Ketul&apos;s and Kumar&apos;s terrible programming habits. finally, out in the open. we all agree the code is shit.</div><div><br/></div><div>Aaron gets up to leave, and we have a small farewell moment, although we&apos;ll see him at least one more time next week. Anthony wants to migrate to the 11th street pub again to continue the evening, and Blessed drives us there. I learned that he&apos;s never been drunk. he leaves soon after, probably because of the smell of cigarette smoke inside. they don&apos;t have sweetwater blue anymore so I work on a 420 instead and get progressively drunker as the night goes on. the bartender had a pet name for Anthony, &quot;princess&quot;.</div><div><br/></div><div>they call the JP a vagina because he didn&apos;t want to drink much. Anthony guesses my go-to hair salon just from my mentioning that it&apos;s korean. I send some messages to the running group and to Hannah. she told me her date was boring and invited me to hang out &quot;for a minute&quot; because she wanted to see me drunk. I remember thinking about making out with her, but she changed her mind and said she was tired. I was at least lucid enough to not persist, thankfully. eventually I reach the point where I take a cigarette, light it, and smoke it. I recall Anthony saying he was proud, but I&apos;m slightly embarrassed that I smoked one. I enjoyed it less than ever this time. every time I went to use bathroom, I looked in the mirror and at the lights and tried to focus on the drunkenness. Anthony&apos;s speech slows down considerably when he&apos;s drunk.</div><div><br/></div><div>something in me pushed me to finally call an uber back. maybe it was the two shots that I took, but I began feeling slightly sick and stepped out for fresh air. I didn&apos;t go back in. to my surprise Zach seemingly came out to check on me. we chatted for a little bit and I mentioned Hannah&apos;s invite and cancellation. I fully realized that he was drunk too, and we were having a drunk conversation.</div><div><br/></div><div>the uber passes me again so I have to walk to it. I&apos;m feeling way tired on top of being drunk so I say nothing on the ride back. the driver was being super chatty with two college girls in the back. at least one of them gave short responses to whatever he was saying. I wonder how out of it I looked.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>I keep thinking of better responses I could have given to Barb when she was over and inadvertently opened a tab with an ASMR video playing.</div><div><br/></div><div>why does Hannah keep telling me I&apos;m funny?</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">6-24 n</span></div><div><br/></div><div>this is bad, when I take my negative feelings and try to find an external source for them. I almost want to be annoyed with Hannah, but that would make no sense. this time I could plainly see the anxiety from miles away, before I even left my apartment to drive myself over there, to the birthday bash for two of her friends? and a cat. I arrived last, sauntered up to the group, and said, &quot;this is that birthday bash?&quot; I walked up to Hannah and said what&apos;s going on, but I don&apos;t think she heard me because she seemed surprised when she turned and saw me, giving me a little hug. several nearby people introduced themselves and I forgot their names instantly. after that, one girl at least made an effort to talk to me. she had a notable, high-pitched voice and pointed out two guys on the grill, one of whom was her husband (!) and the other of whom was another girl&apos;s husband. they all looked around my age and it caught me by surprise to learn that they were married. but I just said &quot;okay&quot; instead of making it known. if I couldn&apos;t even be genuine about that, then there was never any chance at all.</div><div><br/></div><div>I ate some food while the rest of them trickled into the pool one by one. one of the other girls asked if I wanted to pull up my chair to sit closer to them. when she asked me who I knew here I at first kind of joked that I didn&apos;t know anyone and just showed up, but was already too stuck in my head to continue it any further. soon after they got into the water as well, and I was left alone with just one other person who stayed dry, a Bobby. I tried to talking to him a bit, and he seemed to be the slightly nervous one, mentioning that he isn&apos;t the most social person while stuttering a lot. I guess he just wasn&apos;t comfortable with me because he seemed to do fine with the others. he had a funny laugh. I can&apos;t remember if I saw him at Hannah&apos;s birthday lunch three months ago.</div><div><br/></div><div>most of the remaining time there was spent caught in the abyss, catching nobody&apos;s eye, faded to the background. the mosquitoes did not help. the second girl who talked to me brought the cat out from somewhere. they sloppily sung happy birthday. I had a small slice of the cookie cake. I reached the state of mind where I listened in on conversations and thought they were all a waste of time. when Hannah finally talked to me for a bit, I watched myself feel a little better. but there&apos;s nothing left there anymore. Hannah brought up my lego set again but I didn&apos;t feel like talking about it, not bothering to clarify that it was the millenium falcon and not the death star, not correcting her when she said it had 5,000 pieces. I told her I didn&apos;t want to go the asian meetup dinner anymore, and said she was welcome to join me and Dorothy et al. at masti. I realized the other asian guy there was the one she came here with. when they left, I followed them out. I could feel myself projecting onto him immediately.</div><div><br/></div><div>no one is going to remember me, and it&apos;s because of me. it&apos;s like hoping people will remember you as a star of the crowd when all you did was stare through a window from far away.</div><div><br/></div><div>the last and only other time I&apos;d been to masti was probably nearly two years ago, after Bina mentioned the place. I was banking on emotionally recovering there, with familiar people, but it was slower than I&apos;d hoped. Dorothy and Cody, the only others there, still talk much more to each other than they do to me. every time I want to say something it feels like I have to butt and force myself in. like I&apos;m just an addon rather than a core member of the circle.</div><div><br/></div><div>Dorothy drove us to the area in decatur where I had been to one other time, over four years ago with monique. Cody paid for the parking. while walking around the streets, the conversation settled on David. I should just accept that the gossip will be an ongoing and normal thing. so David exhibits some signs of bipolar disorder and gets deeply absorbed in his own philosophical talks, while expecting/borderline demanding others&apos; attention as he&apos;s talking. apparently on the night of the pool party he got annoyed that Dorothy wasn&apos;t listening to him while they were walking around target looking for firewood, and did an eyes-on-me gesture while reminding her that he was talking. maybe my personality just doesn&apos;t invite anybody out, because I would never have known about these sides of people. also he&apos;s hit on just about every girl in our group, according to Dorothy even on Hannah, although I didn&apos;t hear him say anything that night. he wouldn&apos;t leave Dorothy&apos;s house as she and Heather tried to hint at him they needed to go to bed and wanted him gone. and based on his behavior, he&apos;s slightly desperate to connect with someone. all of this backside discussion is intimidating, not only because they might also be talking about me when I&apos;m not around, but also because it makes me realize things about people that I wasn&apos;t able to detect on my own.</div><div><br/></div><div>I feel like my attempt to be nice by buying Cody and Dorothy a popsicle was in vain, because they were nearly $4 each and tasted very artificial. none of us liked them that much.</div><div><br/></div><div>the brick store pub still exists and it took me a minute to locate the hefeweizen on their menu. Cody didn&apos;t think much of the picture of my glass that I took, and showed off his own outside. Jay appeared and joined us. I don&apos;t think neither of us said very much. most of the activity was again between Cody and Dorothy, as they talked about Cody&apos;s ex once more.</div><div><br/></div><div>after dusk we relocated to a crappy-looking pizzeria. I saw no point in having more beer. Dorothy confirmed with me that I&apos;d bring my weed to David&apos;s place today, and Jay noticeably addressed me directly, telling me that he&apos;d be present if I did bring it. if any of them happen to be looking forward to my presence, it&apos;s only because of this.</div><div><br/></div><div>I didn&apos;t care to potentially see the Claire again, so I left with Dorothy and Cody, leaving Jay alone to possibly meet up with her himself later. and on the walk back to the car, Cody showed Dorothy a text message on his phone, which I assumed was from his ex. he said that &quot;she&quot; had never texted him out of the blue like that before, possibly playing the pronoun game with me, before cluing me in that they were talking about Barb. there isn&apos;t too much jealousy cooking, but only in this particular instance. this insanity is a narrow bridge. there is so little separating me from that terrible devastation. is it worth the continued safety?</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>while I never officially confirmed with petunia that I&apos;d be going to his pool party, I&apos;d generally been hinting that I would be there, only to cancel on him this morning when he, intentionally or not, kind of gave me an out. I was willing to meet him for lunch, but things weren&apos;t clear so I didn&apos;t meet him today after all. I felt a little bad but wasn&apos;t 100% comfortable with the idea anyway.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">6-25 m</span></div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday turned out to be uneventful. on the way to David&apos;s, I stopped by the smoke shop to pick up some screens. it was $1.08 for a little 5-pack but the lady let me have it for $1 because I didn&apos;t have any change. I was the first one to arrive at his place; he was still in his shirt and pants. apparently he had forgotten it was his dad&apos;s birthday until earlier that day and had to scramble to accommodate those plans. Jay was the second one there and asked if I brought my pot. I don&apos;t think anyone had clued David in on our plans. Dorothy and Heather were the only ones remaining, and we had an ordinary dinner. I didn&apos;t talk much, as usual, but I felt okay because there was nothing threatening or anxiety-inducing happening. Dorothy decided against smoking tonight yet again. she must either be nervous to try, or not be really excited for it at all. I wonder if Jay was disappointed.</div><div><br/></div><div>today I took the day off from work because I&apos;m certain I got food poisoning from something I ate at David&apos;s. but I didn&apos;t ask any of the others how they felt.</div><div><br/></div><div>today Hannah messaged me for the nth time because she wanted to talk about her John, who I&apos;m kind of over hearing about. I gave my usual flippant answers. out of blue, she told me she was going over to Tia&apos;s place to have dinner with her and her mom? and some others. and invited me, with Tia herself messaging as well. I declined this invite in favor of staying home and playing L4D2 with &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE. continuing messaging Hannah here and there, she asked me if there was anything going on she should know, that I wanted to tell her about. just checking up on me, she said. what is that?</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">6-29 f</span></div><div><br/></div><div>wednesday night: I smoke quite a bit and the high is finally considerable again. it&apos;s the first time I smoke alone, and it&apos;s only because I wanted to use up the bits that I had already ground up. I didn&apos;t know how long it would last before going bad.</div><div><br/></div><div>on thursday a bunch of us at work go out to lunch at pho king. Blessed pushes me again to drive. I don&apos;t mind but I&apos;m annoyed at the same time. he initially doesn&apos;t believe that the restaurant name &quot;pho king&quot; was intentional, for some reason. he tells me I&apos;m a good driver. he asked me about the suicide knob on my steering wheel.</div><div><br/></div><div>I go the crc after work and am able to bench 225 lbs for the first time. I tell chris about it and he just says nice, congrats.</div><div><br/></div><div>this morning Anthony gave me some positive feedback about my groovy scripts, and I made a quip about not being used to hearing positivity from him. Danny has been modifying them himself and I have to manually incorporate them into my copy of the files because he doesn&apos;t use git to track them. I think I&apos;m getting worse at coding every day I stay here. dealing with their shit code and not learning anything new.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">6-30 s</span></div><div><br/></div><div>I had been worried about what I was potentially getting myself into.</div><div><br/></div><div>Currently we, Barb, and Cody are sitting together on the couch watching <span style="font-style: italic;">Predator</span>. I&apos;m paying attention to her body language. Not towards me, but to him. She&apos;s curled up facing him. They&apos;re touching.</div><div><br/></div><div>Barb was the one who sort of proposed that we get together later today. Bringing up the movie that I had suggested a couple weeks ago. Soon after, I figured that she mainly just wanted to hand out with Cody. She was actually willing to drive me over to his place, so at least she&apos;s comfortable doing that. I think that was the first or second time I&apos;ve ridden in a convertible with the top down. I kept forgetting that people could see me.</div><div><br/></div><div>The first thing we did was go down to the pool, where the water tasted bad and felt kind of slimy. Barb confessed that David had acted creepy and almost hateful towards her. We talked about him again for a while. How he&apos;s systematically hit on every girl in our group. Barb thinks he&apos;s desperately lonely.</div><div><br/></div><div>We talked a little more after climbing out. Barb said that I say funny things. I guess ultimately I don&apos;t come across too negatively overall. I tried to not stare at Barb too many times.</div><div><br/></div><div>That leads back to Cody&apos;s apartment, which smells nicely of a home. He was happy to excitedly show us some of his framed artwork.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m still slightly confused about how I feel about Cody and Barb. Snuggled up against him under a blanket. He keeps quoting lines right before they&apos;re spoken. Barb finds it endearing, it seems. I deliberately waited for Cody to sit on the couch first before joining, because I figured she&apos;d want to sit next to him.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>all I need is to have an easier time relaxing around Barb. there&apos;s really no reason I shouldn&apos;t be able to. I felt mostly fine on the ride she gave me back home. she suggested she teach me how to drive a manual. I&apos;m toying with the idea that she&apos;s going back to Cody&apos;s apartment after dropping me off here.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

03-01; thursday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>steph's mom is a cannibal and she's chasing me through the woods with a pack of kids. the kids are trying to attack me and I'm trying to bat them away with a backpack or something but I can't because I move too slowly and it's annoying. I make it to a small circular house surrounded by a high-tech fence. I check a map to see how long the woods go on and find it makes a huge circle around the entire bottom half of the city. but (mike?) reassures me that she only patrols the eastern half. how could steph's mom be a cannibal? I wander around upstairs and do something. I go back outside to see what up with her now. she opens her mouth and tons of bees fly out. I run away but feel a couple under my shirt. I take it off and shake it. the bees are gone. <br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>steph and sam and I are walking by an uphill street. we reach an intersection and meet someone and stop to talk for a bit. we continue.. ..we're in some big classroom building. we enter a room lined with chairs and a projector screen up front with a podium with a microphone. it's empty save for us and perhaps two other unknowns. I think one of steph's friends who I don't know is also with us. steph takes off her shirt. she's completely topless. I don't react besides staring every few seconds and in the back of my mind wondering why. I sit next to her and she leans forward and folds her arms across her front. I think she later puts her shirt back on.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I get another D on my intro section for psyc2015. also several emails I find in my spam inbox concerning the class that sam had sent.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my torrenting caught up with me today. my network finally became disabled. strange that it happens two months after it was supposed to. I hope things go okay.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sam lets me borrow his gt login. he tells me his password.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I end up going to the aquarium with sam and a guy named kevin. steph isn't there. I don't like kevin, but have no reason for it. I hope it stops and I get over it. sam talks a lot more to kevin than to me while we were there. what does that say about me?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>from unwrittenspokenwords:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Initiative: the ability to assess and initiate things independently; the power or opportunity to act or take charge before others do. We all take initiative whenever something excites us, something that interests us. I think what the problem is: maintenance; Maintaining that initiative and drive to keep it going. We are a generation that has many ideas and many dreams. We dream big and start big but our problem is, we do not finish big. I see the spark in some peoples voices when they speak about their dreams. I see the determination and motivation when they first start out but as the time wears on, those same dreams and goals seem to disappear.. The keyword to describe this generation: boredom. We do not see the finish line, all we see is the opportunity to start; the opportunity to get our feet wet. We never go far into the deep end and I cannot figure out why. I have seen so many great ideas start yet never finish. As time passes, we become lackadaisical with the project at hand. We are the generation that asks why and how; we look for the faster way of doing things because we believe in “the balance of life.” We want to do things as fast as possible so that we can move on to the next task. The funny thing is, if it does not happen as fast as our timeline says it should, we move on without even finishing it. We lack patience. We lack the finishing touch. We really need to see both the starting line and the finish line.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>maintenance then. motivation that stays. a bit of force isn't enough because it isn't an object-in-motion-will-stay-in-motion thing we're talking about here..too much friction. we never go far into the deep end and I cannot figure out why either. has anyone?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>750 words 750 words I just need to surpass the limit and I'll be right back to tell the rest I promise. so close. now.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>steph and david. no more need said.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>over the past year I have convinced myself that she's perfect for me. I stare at her face and ignore the scratches. they aren't flaws anymore. they're parts of her and her imperfections are perfection. every move she makes speaks to me, her every action holds meaning. but her actions mean nothing. I'm seeing phantoms. when my eyes are opened, and if I don't stubbornly shut them again this time, I'll realize I've been walking through a mist. laced with hallucinogens. love drives me crazy.</div>

<hr/>
03-03; saturday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I still can't understand why it's so hard to start. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>food for thought: what is faith? what are we going to do regarding steph? are we any different? can we smile? can we walk with a skip in every other step? can we find a content perfection in every imperfection? live and learn.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>let's not waste any money on lego architecture sets. let's not center our new desire around that. we went to target last night with sam, steph, david, and mike and nobody bought any legos. even though we all love legos. but there are important things. no one bought a 3ds or ps vita either. it would be fun, but we have more fun with each other in the time we spend together. make the moments worth remembering and the words worth sharing. don't waste money on legos. they're overpriced.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>she pats my arm a couple times. I look her in the eyes every time she laughs at something I say.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I walk into the room and she has her head on his lap. seven hours later they say a soft, quick good-night to each other.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>she sleeps peacefully.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I don't know how likely it is to happen, but if it does? I know there are depths in my heart lined with explosives set to detonate upon hearing the news. maybe this time a river will wash through newly made crevices. my face will not twitch. but I'll be plagued with the lost thoughts of my dreams. and she'll happily cruise while I drown again in the sea I don't know how to swim in.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>loneliness</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>but now also with a hint of contentment. God is with me. I've felt His presence grow. I've followed as He guided me. I'm very grateful that even though I've barely started to chip away at my obliviousness, I still aimed enough attention at Him to realize He's moving me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>bitterness dries. consider my roommates: kenny and tam and phammy. I loved tam and pham and then hated tam and pham and then loved tam and pham again. I judge kenny a lot and that hasn't changed. I don't like rooming with him still. I think of all the ways in which I'm convinced I'm better than him. even though he's intelligent but he's dirty and doesn't know how to talk and I'm convinced he's one of those living a blind life with no goal or contentment. every time such a thought skirts my mind I ask myself the about the same regarding me and never come up with an answer.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>but if the puddle shrank, perhaps it'll dry up completely one day. as long as I let the sun push the clouds out of the way. and learn to enjoy sunlight, not just rainy days.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>these moments, when I slip. when I tentatively, temporarily place things in front of God. make them a higher priority than God. I can't let them become perpetually temporary. prithee, God, forgive us. the best people I know fall so often. it's an imperfection that's bound hand-in-hand with being a human. brought forth by all the world's temptations and selfish sorrows. pray just that we can always find within ourselves the rock bottom resolution to try with all our hearts to be loving like you. pray just that we can always have an always burning, nondepletable faith in You to draw upon. make us greater than ourselves. our hearts will be changed. really, our hearts will actually change. we will realize the perfect heart is truly impossible for us to fit in our chests. but we'll love anyway.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>every day.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>doesn't have to be different. just worth living. every day we'll find something hidden as we walk to and from class, taking bumpy bus rides, eating food at the student center. there's no waiting, no lines. every means of changing what needs to be different lies within us. it's so simple and kind of beautiful when you first unwrap the discovery. it is for me.</div>

<hr/>
03-04; sunday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>750 words in 47 minutes. can I do it?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so I was going to just give up again today because of all the time spent hanging out but here's a chance.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today kicked off late in the afternoon when david just happened to walk in on me just as I was doing laundry. ended 5 hours later when I decide to come back here instead of watching kung-fu panda 2 with him, sam, and steph. on second thought, maybe I should've stayed.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>if I hadn't bumped into him, today would just have been another dreary dull sunday. not necessarily miserable. but maybe only because I wouldn't have known that he was going to hang out with them anyway.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>without including me. but why should they anyway? there are others we're all close-ish with that aren't included all the time. nobody is included all the time. we just need to make sure that the times we are included in will be remembered. so don't ever skimp out on anything no matter how bitter we may be feeling.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>skipped church at midtown today because I basically didn't feel like going and I had laundry to do and thought I had psyc2015 homework to do too.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we the four of us went to mcdonald's where they just wanted to get apple pies but I thought I'd get dinner there until they reacted with surprise and I just went never mind. and again I waste money (almost $9) for 20 chicken nuggets on some seriously unhealthy food. much of the time these days I just feel like a foul bachelor frog who doesn't know how to do anything with himself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and it's still fascinating, the speed with which david became a part of our community. I'm truly glad, now that I realize it, that no part of me is bitter, that nothing's ever cropped up in me that resented him suddenly appearing. that felt like he was stealing something from me. is my heart changing..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>as we pass the vending machines kenny glances at us and pretends to stare at the food. we look in his direction, he doesn't look back. I smile, I judge.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ah, I have reading to do for english.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>turn all my attention to only the thing I'm doing right now and then I'll actually do it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>david and I play portal 2's co-op mode. it's my first time playing the mode and glados is very condescending. I actually felt self-conscious.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I lose my earphones today. I don't know why I don't feel disappointed. I'll just have to go and splurge more money on another pair of earphones that I'll have to make sure are bass-heavy. money again. recent wastes: $86 on apple in-ear headphones, $50 itunes card, $75 on sennheiser hd-280. but since none of it's my money maybe I haven't really made any serious mistakes yet. I still want to get legos, but oh God, don't let me pour money and center my heart on materials. such as $6000 on a car. that would suck. I would hate that.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I wonder how cs3750 will continue from here on out. the quickchat. now I also have the oit meeting. me. my friends would never have these problems. they would never have to deal with themselves like this. perhaps everyone has problems, but everybody seems a whole lot more set than I am. I feel incompetent and inadequate to go out there. useless. weak. what would I be good for? nothing's happened to me, nothing traumatic to flip over and draw strength from.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I would very much like to learn how to cook and brew tea and read books and study efficiently and learn how to lead and how to talk and be able to work a job. some people aren't so awkward on the outside. but he hides inside a shell and that's when it's safe for everybody to think to themselves about how in__________ and un__________ you really are and how you're really going to need to get shit together to be able to walk anywhere further. me? I need someone with a hammer to break my shell open. why not me though?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>still</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>haven't</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>fully</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>realized</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>stupid useless words that get cloned and I don't know how to organize them into what I really want to say. I want to be able to travel back a year or two and read my news and smile at it, not blush. point at pictures and cry and smile and not try to cover it up. but I've always wanted to cover up my drawings and essays. every time</div>
<div><br/></div>

<hr/>
03-05; monday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>just keep swimming</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>keep calm and carry on</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>paula kept praying</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>oh what do I want to do?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today I actually went to the barcelona meet &amp; greet instead of being lazy and antisocial and skipping out. I sat at the end of the front row and was one of two or three people who weren't talking with anybody (the others were one girl who was doing work on her laptop and a group partner from a class last semester). still apprehensive about the upcoming summer. just almost desperately hoping that my introverted-ness won't end up hindering another once-in-a-lifetime experience.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>she makes a sad face when I leave starbucks to go to class. that leaves her alone with craft.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>no more complaining, I say. I'll stop lamenting. about the way things are or the way things could be now or could have been. reading marc and angel gets my heart excited and pumped up and ready for something that I had always ended up not doing. until now. maybe. that's up to me. I know for sure now that the only I have to do today is smile. everything falls into place when you smile and welcome it all in.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I want to point my gaze to the stars and moon as I walk and not have to worry about crashing into anything.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>gosh, what goes through my head if it's this difficult to find stuff to write down?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I want to write and I want to take pictures and I want to blog. I can escape into my head where nothing is taboo and vent steam and cry gloriously to my heart's content and nobody will ever know.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I don't have to learn how to play a musical instrument. for now being able to hit the right notes with my vocal chords will be enough. as long as I can hear myself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a work in progress.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>silly how recently it was that I thought life had a finish line to reach.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>buying a thousands-of-dollars watch is completely useless if you don't know anything about clockworks and gears and metals and how they all spin to tell time with an accuracy of within 0.0001 seconds of whatever time it actually is.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>enough with the metaphors.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so I know now that there really is no end to this race and trying to sprint towards it will just exhaust you and leave you with no energy to look around and no room to breathe deeply and slowly to inhale sweet air.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my limbs are stiff and tight. I've forgotten how wonderful it feels to stretch. I'm starting to extend my reach though. and unfurl the tight ball my mind's curled up into.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>what would I include on a to-don't list?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>but I've stopped wasting time on tumblr and stopped exhausting happiness on facebook.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>despite all the Now I've gathered into syringes that I am ready to inject myself with I still insist on waiting 11 days until I arrive home to get myself a Bible and a notebook to read. and write. it's harder than it looks, isn't it? aha. putting everything off for later still.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>envision, visualize. doing the little, arty things I want to take up, it's not as easy as sliding down a rainbow but I'm sure it'll be colorful and it'll bring a rewarding rush. sometimes things turn out perfectly by themselves.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>how remarkable was today? hanging out is quite a normal occurrence for other people. for weeks I've gone to bed halfheartedly posing to myself the question, &quot;what did I do today that made it worthwhile?&quot; without ever answering myself because I knew every time the answer was &quot;nothing.&quot; but just writing this brings it a step up from nothing and if I'd like, it'll only go uphill from here.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a list of things there's no reason to not start doing today:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the Bible. pore over a chapter and absorb the words into my soul and reflect them in my life the next day, or throughout the same day, and every day after.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>watch people around me without judging. not an ounce</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>pour out my heart to the one and only who'll listen. it's so simple so long as it's wholehearted..an all or nothing thing. pray to God.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>if however deep down I know I still won't do it in favor of doing something else, or simply skimping..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I don't like obfuscation and will have to make sure not to do it. how do ones like paradoxical sentiments and kreesha do it? I hope I'll learn. maybe a notebook will help. it's so dreamy, light, like a cool misty breeze softly caressing my eyelids. everything is white and I open my eyes a little bit wider. I hope I can become like you guys someday. I mean why not? I'll do it if I want. I won't become discouraged and I'll learn and I'll achieve this. of this I'll be sure.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
03-06; tuesday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>1738 wondering if I should start time stamping these or else there will be no way to tell. I figured I would have to start this since small group will be at 7 and I typically end up staying over for 5 hours or longer.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I really need that notebook.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and I can't figure out why paradoxical sentiments hasn't answered me. the nasty blend of real emotions that emerges from virtual conversations online is back, this time with somebody I don't even know and with a conversation that lasted all of two lines. it's been so long since I last held a conversation online with somebody I want to talk to.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>everything that runs through my mind that I consider putting down always seems so trite and meaningless and sometimes plain stupid and I can never come up with some elaborate, artful way of mysteriously and somehow successfully conveying this mystical blur that's raging through my mind. maybe not so mystical.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm such a simple person. there's a purpose for all the bareness and blankness that's present in intentional minimalism but me? I feel like one of the more pointless-seeming pieces of abstract art, the child of an artist who was simply bored and never really had anything in mind when he declared his blank canvas a work of art. I'm quiet, but there's no method to my silence, just shyness and social anxiety and the fact that I really have nothing to say about all the things I don't know. I fear I'll always be the awkward sort of introvert, voice straining to be heard, unsteady unsure posture, shallow eyed, unsophisticated. if I tell some people this, I'm sure they'd say it's untrue. but that won't do much good unless I already know it's untrue.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it's the same things over and over that run through my mind. I want to make the bubble burst. look everybody in the eye, say fuck you, and induce so much pressure until it does snap and nothing will matter anymore, I'll be happy and floating in the wind doing what I want and being who I want to be. clichéd words but how many people here are really who they want to be? that I can't judge.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I saw a guy and girl in the student center while eating chick fil-a and couldn't stop judging, couldn't stop looking how the guy was somewhat awkward while the girl just carefreely rambled on whenever she talked and a second stopped by and he seemed awkward too, holding his thumbs up when the first guy asked how he was while they proceeded to have what in my mind was a stupid and meaningless conversation. I never really admitted to myself that everything I just thought was the same with me, that maybe it wasn't even true for them but still was for me because I know it was for me, with people like lisa and christine, when I used to talk to them, and her of course too. I go outside and see ritche and say &quot;witchie&quot; and proceed to do the exact same thing I had seen the first guy do. asking questions like &quot;where are you going&quot; while stupidly smiling in silence. I had no other words. I lied about not attending church with him last weekend.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>there I was: lying to someone's face, judging, eating junk food, sitting down. here I am still believing I'm better than everybody.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I promise I'll narrow the new life down into little doable bits and deal with them all one by one.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>but I still wait. for that notebook.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm unpleasantly impressed by the length's I'll go to to stop myself from starting to write.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at least tim from english class is nice enough to say hi to me when we bump into each other at starbucks again. he asks me if I've done the english reading. he goes to get his coffee or whatever he ordered at starbucks and we don't say anything else and start walking in the same direction.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I could say what the signals she gave off that I'm making up that I'm making myself see were but I think it'd be better if I don't.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>but after small group I could tell I was going to be bored because she and henry and tam were cooking and I was left sitting on the couch doing nothing even though david came in again (I forgot he was going to stop by) and also because I couldn't get windows 8 installed on the macbook air and even if it did work I'd just be customizing it all and it would have been a terribly unfulfilling way to spend the evening. I say nothing in small group again although I did smile a few times and laughed at things enoch said.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
03-07; wednesday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today I bought a sandwich from subway after english class and ate the whole thing. then I actually worked on combinatorics homework during the hour-long stretch I have left after eating before my graphics class. I didn't see mike again today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I walk with sam back to ULC even though I keep thinking of going back to my room. I do go back to my room after stealing a few pieces of pineapple from mike. it was deliciously sweet, I have to go buy some pineapple soon.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the ipad 3 announcement today wasn't so exciting. I'm not getting excited about apple product announcements anymore. I think that makes me happy. I'm hoping that it's not the product spec bumps that are getting boring, rather that I just don't hold so much stake in apple products anymore. ever since blowing those $86 on the pair of unbelievably terrible earphones. I won't be getting anything apple in a long time, I say.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I haven't worked out in two weeks, and today since it was a busy hour at the CRC mike decides to switch over to a different workout routine. we do pull-ups and dips and push-ups and the ab bicycle exercise and squats. full body. it was nice finally burning some energy, but I don't know how I'm going to make myself keep it up every day until next wednesday.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>maybe dead space crashing every time I reach this particular area is a sign that I should stop playing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I was unsurprised when the ACF leaders did their group prayer without me this time. maybe they pulled a couple other new people into it this time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ACF large group today started with something unexpected. I was in a group with her and helen and ethan and we had to build a freestanding structure with spaghetti sticks and marshmallows. it was I who suggested that we build a triangular pyramidal base and go up from there. everyone else built disasters. our group's was pretty much the only one who had something standing when mike said time was up. jack's group had built something probably about as tall as ours but it was toppling and jack kicked it. a couple people suggested I become an ME.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the speaker's name is phillip today and he talked to us about talent. his definition of it went something like &quot;a set of skills that are productively applied&quot; I forgot what he said but the word &quot;productive&quot; was a key point in his definition, which is why the terrorists who blew up the world trade center didn't really qualify as having a talent because blowing up buildings is not usually &quot;productive.&quot;</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>during his entire message all that runs through the back of my mind is my complete lack of talent and how &quot;talent&quot; and &quot;talent shows&quot; always make me think of chinese yo-yo performances. I hesitate when diana prompts me to sign up for ACF's &quot;A Coffeehouse Fundraiser&quot; talent show. tam suggests we dance, but I don't consider his proposal seriously as I doubt he put it forward seriously.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I get the better of myself this time and skip out on eating at jimmy john's with the rest of the group. I briefly ponder my true reason for leaving this time as I head toward chick fil-a again, hoping to make sure it wasn't bitterness at the happiness all the others were having socializing. to be honest with myself, I'd say that I'm afraid that my social ineptitude would just block me from having another happy night shared with other friends over a meal. that I'd just be glancing constantly at her and her face. over and over, getting nowhere, just tearing at the hole in my heart that only gets bigger when she fills it. I hope I'm not becoming someone who doesn't truly appreciate fellow ACFers' companionship anymore, by not following them out of the love building and into a nice restaurant to eat what typically is the heartiest dinner I have every week.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I hope the chick fil-a sandwiches become nasty so I won't be eating their chicken every other freaking day and night, alone, sitting at a table in the empty student center reverberating with lonely empty background noise. and then walk a dark walk back down to room 110 at sixth street.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I wish I had a warm comfy cozy routine to go through to get me warm and fuzzy and drowsy and content when I fall asleep.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I realized that emulating jessie roth and the way she blogs won't lead me to the thing I want because I'd just be trying to create artificial copies of her words, her words that work so well at capturing her emotion. I have to figure out a way to make it work for me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
03-08; thursday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today I failed again. and spend the rest of the afternoon feeling defeated. I just couldn't stop myself from deliberately holding on to a heavy anchor and drifting away from the others today as I said not a single word as we climbed up the short flight of stairs to where she was waiting with food for her brother up until we parted and headed for class. in fact I haven't said anything since, not since the class ended (chick fil-a does not count) and I made my typical way to starbucks again.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>read over the lyrics to owl city's &quot;honey and the bee.&quot; read several articles on love on thought catalog. heart jumped and began revving when I noticed her laugh and I turn to my 4 o'clock and see her and david again, snap my head back around and begin packing up my stuff. I was going to leave soon anyway, I was sure, to work on my english presentation. hear her laugh one more time. turn around again to make sure they're still there; maybe I can walk in front of them and sit down at the seats across from them. that can be my entrance. didn't they see me as they walked in? why did they say nothing to me? anyway even once I sit down across from them I'd have to raise my voice and yell words at them to keep a conversation going, something I'd find awkward doing in the loud starbucks and I'd feel failure again right there.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I stand up and I turn around and they're gone. I can't see them outside or heading towards the stairs. they hang on my mind for the next several minutes as I begin slowly walking back, and I begin to honestly question myself about whether I just hallucinated the two of them sitting there. I'd rather it be that. but I've never hallucinated before. I probably didn't. if I go to hid midweek munchies tonight, I really don't want to ask if they were at starbucks. they, because surely she will already be in the room with him by the time I get there..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>realize that if I were to hang out with her best friends I'd be a laughable failure. even if it's only for the time being, I just can't do it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I lost a little more faith in myself today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>feeling substanceless. existence just a cloud of grey. to exist may be to encompass meaning, but I'm finding very little of that in mine. and as much as I've read and eagerly told myself about all the wonderful glorious meaning I'm going to create for myself, I still haven't found out how and am wondering if I ever really got up to start.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>&quot;how you know&quot; by talia ralph.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I think about her as I read every sentence and am disappointed whenever one doesn't apply to her.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm considering turning my phone off and just leaving it off for a few days. what'll happen?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I also want to delete asta's emails and texts and photos. don't want those butting in ever either.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I just watched the 48-second video I took of a skype video call and know I can't do it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm also about to ask david if he was at starbucks today. I simply can't help myself with these things.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>but I didn't. I'll leave the text there and the next I go to send something to him I'll see it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>he applied and got a call for an interview less than a week later. how does that happen?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I still always feel left behind in the dark.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>but even after the recent weeks, especially those after emerge, today feels especially down.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a day of retreat, hiding, silence. weight falls back onto me. I can feel it crushing my heart. I'm convinced that I can find a key to happiness, that I'll find some way to do without all the people I want right now. but it isn't happening</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I've stopped trying to engage in conversations and interactions that I find empty, resulting in complete emptiness brought on by no interaction at all because I'm refusing everything that's being offered to me because even though I want to try it's always disappointed me every time and I'm beginning to refuse any more bait.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I can't ask for any of the things I so desperately crave right now that all the people around me seem to have. what am I missing about myself and about them? this is no wishlist I can hand over to a santa.</div>

03-09; friday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>here I am at their apartment again on a friday afternoon. I'm anticipating a rough weekend to be preceded by tonight's movie night so I figured I'd get started writing now to meet my 750-word quota.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I decided to not exhibit super irresponsible behavior today in cs3750 and asked one of my group members what the plan was for part 3 of our project. I still haven't read the requirements so I don't know what's going on. turns out it'll be mostly coding, which would be much easier for me to help out on, even though I know little HTML and javascript and all that stuff so I don't know how much help I'll end up being yet again this time but at least it'll be easier than coming up with bullshit to write.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I think I'll be able to carry through with my idea well &quot;my idea&quot; for my pecha kucha presentation. I'll be finding stuff to blabber on about how I dislike the shift towards touch-based controls. I'm thinking I'll intro with a little discussion on the iphone's leading all smartphones to become all touchscreen, then mention things about our hands and tactile feedback and how we feel no interaction when sliding our fingers across panes of cold glass.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>there was no enoch lunch party today. I see hyo jae get sad/mad about it on facebook. heh. tons of people like my comments on diana's post on my wall suggesting I make a video for the ACF fundraiser but only because I told them to. jokingly of course. and by tons of people I mean ~5.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm feeling a lot better today emotionally than I did yesterday. not feeling amazing or anything, since yesterday somehow felt so draining that if I didn't feel significantly better today I think something would seriously be wrong. but today just feels normal. sitting on the couch halfheartedly pondering what I can actively do to make a day different.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sam shows us a 9gag post and breaks the silence.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it's only being punctured with henry's clicking.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I might be going out later tonight for dinner with some people everybody else knows well but with whom I'm only just acquainted with. and who I less than halfheartedly socialize with. I know I should do better, but I can't stop staying still and can't bring myself to move.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it's a strange weight that I chain myself to. I don't hate them. I just don't bother.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>friday nights have yet to disappoint. though I didn't go shoot hoops with them at around 5 I did go eat a nice hearty pizza dinner with them when mike got off from work and it was nice. I didn't totally stuff myself with nothing but pizza, I ate some baby carrots to make myself feel better just like everyone else's every other plate was also a salad and in total the seven of us used 26 plates.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I managed to stay happy the whole way.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we go back to sam's apartment and take our sweet time making our way to david's place for the third movie night in a row now. steph plays two rounds of temple run on my phone. I end up using my dell computer to play the movie again even she brought hers. I almost feel like I'm standing somewhere close to the center of the party.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now I'm hurriedly typing up the last of today's 750 while watching the school of rock with mike, david, steph, pham, helen, hyo jae, and jose (who has his arm around her, shocking) and God knows how late we'll all stay up this time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm still not looking forward to this weekend but I do think I'm gonna try to make the most of tonight while it lasts..probably will end up staying for two movies after all.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and afterwards there'll be nothing left to do but just to plow on through the last week of school before spring break.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>classic rock on the movie. I have to find out the songs they're using.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>just searching for ways my eyes were opened a little bit more today. for one, I'm certain I'm suddenly not as judgmental towards helen anymore. anything else? she's not inflicting as much pain in my heart as she used to. I don't feel particularly sad or depressed when I look at her. she's just cute. this is all just filler.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>buuut I'm taken aback at seeing his arm around hannah. who knew? now we all know.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and that's all today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
03-10; saturday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this is the best start to a weekend I've ever had this semester. it started off with a tiny GIGs meeting. it was only four of us today, so it was the most intimate ACF group I've ever been in. despite that though, we didn't have much to say about today's topic, the ten commandments, and what makes laws good or bad.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>from what I gather the others had only watched half of my sassy girl before deciding to switch over to white collar because the movie was simply too long. maybe it's a semi-good thing that I didn't stay too late last night then, because I didn't find the show all that interesting when I watched an episode at sam's a while ago..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>helen asks if I'd be interested in having lunch and I get foolishly scared for a second before she continues with the question and asks if I'd be interested in having lunch as a GIGs group to which I say of course. we look through a slew of places to eat in scoutmob before simply deciding on mcdonald's -_- so we go to mcdonald's and eat unhealthy crap again but it was good and the most full I've ever been on a saturday.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm still not looking forward to finishing my pecha kucha presentation. I think I'm always underestimating in my head how difficult it's going to be speaking for 200 seconds nonstop. I'm not sure how I'm going to come up with three minutes of original material covering a dislike for touch based control.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I may try to make myself play through earthbound again. maybe super mario world and super metroid while I'm at it? no I don't think I'll have that much time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>spent only a brief moment on the walk back to my room pondering what exactly the facets of me that I'm so dissatisfied with are. there are just so many things that make up a person that are underdeveloped in me. so many things a person will have to deal with in life that deep down I know I'm so unready to face.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>all this time and time again, and every day is the same. was today the same? I wasted so much time today on gizmodo and the like, and further organizing my itunes library, which I'd promised to stop doing. it's just one of those many places where there will never be any contentment to be found in perfect organization, and it shouldn't be so hard at this point to stop caring and putting so much stake in it. I'm sure nobody else I know thinks of these things this way..they have it nice, don't they.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>all my perfect movie in my head scenarios pathetically consist of nice cars and high-end electronics.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I don't know how well this 750 words thing is working for me. that don't-break-the-streak thing is keeping me going every day so far, but I'm honestly wondering if I'm being subconsciously lazy and convincing myself without realizing it that the 750 word minimum isn't all that great because it's just making me churn out stuff, and that if I really wanted to write I'd just be writing whatever, not always 750 words of things.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>tomorrow I have to shopping for &quot;groceries&quot; while squeezing in studying for all the material we've covered all semester in UI design. I'm also starting to think I should have signed up for a monday presentation in english, so I can get it over with sooner..unsure if I would be thinking similarly if I actually had. but finishing the presenting, leaving behind the nervousness, and not caring about how good or bad people might it is is very appealing right now.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at least it's not some essay or writing I have to be working on right now. finishing the psyc lab report early was worth something after all.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I wish I knew how to cook. it's just so much better in about every possible way than going out to buy hot pockets and eating a little carton of yogurt every morning. add to the list of ways I need to revise my lifestyle that I'd really like to start checking off soon.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>what I need is a notebook to write in, a clean desk..some place where there is zero electronic interference. I'm spending more time thinking about creating the optimal environment and envisioning what I'm going to be like living in it than doing anything else. how do I do this?</div>
<div><br/></div>

<hr/>
03-11; sunday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I stop seeing because I stop looking but then I start wondering where it all went when all I have to do is open my eyes a little wider dilate my pupils and let some more light in.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>once in a while something I had almost forgotten existed finds its way back to me on its own. it's cute, it's happy, it makes my heart pound for a few moments, like a little lost puppy. love is a puppy licking your face after you've left it alone all day.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I love you too, mo, and I'm praying for you too! ~</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm in a lighthouse. there's no sign of life. the wind is dead. the water doesn't dare move. the birds are still. the insects are still. the rocks are still. the only light comes from the stars. ships stopped passing by long ago in favor of friendlier water. sometimes you can hear them blowing their horns as they sail by other lighthouses that smile and guide and wave them through. I'm alone in my dark lighthouse and open a window and let ice snake in and wrap a hard blanket around my face. I clutch a candle in my hand. it's the one thing I have that will give me light and warmth. that can dance and sing to me as I watch contentedly while falling asleep in its arms. if only it were lit. but it's not, the candle is cold and hard too and pushes against my palm. I wish I could hug it but I'm afraid to light matches. ~</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>&quot;feeling so weird. uncomfortable again. i wish i’d quit picking myself apart trying to make sense of things. i have a new moment of clarity every day, sometimes every hour, i make incredible sense to myself and then nothing makes any sense at all. i spend so much time trying to nurture my self-perception, and i don’t even do it for myself. i do it for anyone else. whatever. sometimes my existence feels like a collection of different stories, and it’s so nice in the mornings and so confusing before bed. makes me feel vulnerable and tired. i don’t know. i don’t know who i am at all some nights, but i know that i want everyone to want me… and i know that i need to travel again, soon. i need to go. i need to go like i need to breathe. need to take the very familiar drive to the airport, need to be on an airplane. need to take in ten new atmospheres. i think things will feel better then.&quot;</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>gotta drink these words until I can feel them flowing to my fingertips. ~</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today I walked past a girl on the way to the dining hall. she was looking at the ground and lifted her head up slightly and we only made eye contact for an instant before my eyes involuntarily flitted away. she looked sad. some people look sad all the time, whether it's because they actually were crying their eyes out in bed the night before or because it's simply the way their neutral face happens to look. I found myself wondering which side she weighed more heavily on, where she was going, what she was walking back to. what if she just had her heart broken? she was probably just heading to her room to study for some test before spring break. either way I wish I had smiled at her. ~</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ritchie and I are late to church today because he had a meeting. I meet a girl named jane. she talks to me a little bit. the speaker is named scott and he speaks about anger and patience. I naively think that none of it will apply to me before quickly realizing that every word he said very much applied to me. I had felt a lot of anger and impatience during my freshman year and only began to recognize it at the beginning of sophomore year and am just starting to quell the rough seas now. bring me that horizon!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I lift my hands in the air during the ending worship. ~</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I thought I heard her laugh while I was in starbucks. of course she wasn't there. I'm hearing things. I'm still not really sure if I actually saw her and him laughing together the other day because the second time I turned my head around they were nowhere to be seen. I'll never ask either of them and I'll never know. ~</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>

<hr/>
03-12; monday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today had its ups. english class ended 15 minutes early and psyc lab ended two and a half hours early. sam and I almost didn't know what to do with the extra time. we walk really slowly back to our rooms.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today had its downs too. I'm quite sure the cs3750 midterm destroyed me but I walked out of the room with a strange sense of calm that I rarely feel after a test even if I end up doing well. I just didn't care about this test and I'm not sure why. I'm still normally frantically studying for my two other tests this week though and am not looking forward to scrambling to finish the ray tracer project that is reportedly very difficult and I haven't even glanced at it yet. sam will get another head start on me. that means he can explain much of it to me. thanks sam.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on our way back to west campus we walk past my roommate. we both look right at him as he passes us. he obviously deliberately looks in the opposite direction as we walk past each other. I highly doubt he's genuinely stupid enough to seriously think that I thought he didn't notice us. fine then. I'm somewhat amused by the look of incredulity on sam's face when he asks why my roommate ignores me all the time. I shrug nonchalantly because I honestly felt that, for him at least, I couldn't care less.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I had to attend OIE's mandatory part ii meeting today. I walk into the mostly filled student center ballroom feeling really conspicuous standing and walking when everyone else is seated. The feeling of being alone in such a crowded room was uncomfortably familiar. it's been a long time since I've last felt its bite. I try texting a friend about it. it doesn't help.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I scoot past two people to sit in the middle of a row and realize that I walked past a guy I barely know through pham. I recognize him just as I'm about to sit down and awkwardly nod to him and realize that getting up and sitting next to him, even though it would have made for horrifyingly broken small talk, would still probably have been better than sitting by myself. I sit still by myself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>apparently my family will get paid some thousands of dollars if I die overseas.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>something popped into my head.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>novelty always wears off. no that's not the actual thing that came up, and besides google autocompleted the phrase so it's not exactly a new idea. I do miss driving quite a lot and catch myself daydreaming about racing around in a fancy car all the time. but I suppose I could own one of the most prestigious cars on this earth and still get tired of it eventually. it could be a lamborghini or a bentley. my heart would all but burst from an adrenaline rush if I ever got to pilot one of those. but then I'd become self conscious watching everybody's heads turn towards me as I'm trying to quietly inch by. and after a while there'd be nothing so special about the car anyway. it'll become ordinary and everyday.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the only high-end thing I own is a very thin laptop and I feel silly now for being so excited when I first opened the box. I've had it for a year and it feels so vain, a cold aluminum hollowed-out shell.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>only a person can be eternally new, right? you can know someone for years and wake up next to her one morning and still feel like you just met her. she'll never become anything less than the most special little thing in the world and nothing in your dreams could replace her. because she's all you dream of. isn't she?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'd like to stare into someone's eyes instead of at my laptop screen all day.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm afraid I've run out for today but still have 85 words to write in 25 minutes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I wish I could cry sometimes. I don't know if it's because I'm a guy and subconsciously don't want to be seen by myself crying or because my heart isn't soft enough for sad movies to hit or because my life is just too not-sad. I have nothing to cry about. I've never even come close, really, to crying over her. I wonder how robust my heart really is. maybe if I never cry over her my heart doesn't truly and wholly want and love her after all.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
03-13; tuesday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>small group ends. jeff closes in prayer tonight. I can tell he was trying hard to look for words. does he not do this sort of thing often? I don't anyway. I do my best to not judge. the group laughs loudly at my comment, which was funnier than I thought it would be too when I said it because I started laughing before I could finish my sentence. all I could think about for a moment was something my professor said in psyc class today about how people who tell jokes laugh significantly more than the people who listen to them. I pay attention to see if this is true in this case.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today in psyc class the teacher lowers the projection screen and writes a word behind it that we can't see. he asks for a volunteer and asks him a bunch of simple arithmetic like 2*7 and 11+3 that all equal 14. we're waiting for the unexpected question to come and it is to name a vegetable. he answers with &quot;greens.&quot; the class laughs. the prof asks other students for other answers and several people say &quot;carrot.&quot; the word he had written behind the screen was &quot;carrot.&quot; because people associate &quot;14&quot; with &quot;carrot&quot; because of gold. but I had thought of a turnip because the number 14 made me think of the color purple. I'd like to think that I think differently.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I don't understand why helen playfully/jokingly but consistently acts upset when we poke light fun at her for saying yaaay a lot. she has allergies so she holds napkins to her face and makes herself look as though she's crying.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>come to think of it it's a similar thing with mike and the funny finger wave he often does. becomes self conscious and starts repressing an adorable little behavior we all love, actually.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I fairly completely annihilate the combinatorics test today. it's a nice contrast to yesterday's UI design midterm. I should have smiled as I walked out of the room and down skiles walkway without dispair. knowledgeably answering every question on a test! doesn't happen often, especially here (I begrudgingly admit).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>begrudgingly because I'm never amused by tech jokes and only at tech jokes. I have yet to explain this to anybody. remarks about the tech ratio of boys to girls and our penchant for studying fails to hit my funny bone. I'd attribute this to having endured four years of this previously during those glorious s/e high school years. those were great.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>something magical</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>how often do you feel magic?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>take a step back</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and love, encourage.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my pecha kucha presentation is tomorrow and I'm looking forward to blowing through 3 minutes of casual conversation style presenting on touch screens. I haven't presented since the senior projects I had to do in kovalcin's lovely class. pure bullshit in a not-so-strictly enforced no-bullshit environment.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>david walks in. does he get invited over or does he come on his own? on tuesdays because it's during our small group and he's always busy during the actual small group time but decides to stop by to visit? I forget every week. another gap in my memory. eric just asked me a question about last week's large group and it took several moments for me just to recall who the speaker was and what he talked about. I couldn't answer his question. he turns to her, who kind of shrugs off his question too and doesn't answer it. I'm a little surprised because I thought I had just failed again where she would succeed. again. she didn't though. I actually feel better.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>small groups, I realize, are still memory gaps too. this is the first week I've thought about thinking about our discussion outside of small group. I don't think sam ever emailed to us our applications last week. if he did and I don't remember than I just reinforced what I just said..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>things are supposed to be different now. I'm supposed to be aware, focused, and living it all out. still I go to sleep feeling incomplete. I'm desperately hoping breaking away from school for a week might give me some time to cool down before re-firing and launching myself somewhere.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm looking forward to the plane ride. I wish I had better headphones I could use to listen to some nighttime trance-y music. but with no wires to worry about I can better appreciate getting on the subway train on my way to walking through the giant terminal halls.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
03-14; wednesday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my thoughts last night never turned to the student who committed suicide.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my pecha kucha presentation went rather smoothly today. I can't remember the last time I was almost excited to present something. I'm not expecting everyone in the class to vote me up, as there were a few people who presented surprisingly well on some unconventional topics, but I'm simply glad I wasn't caught swallowing after every slide. I kept my voice steady enough for the most part and stumbled a little towards the last two or three slides because I had had words in mind but hadn't planned out transitions so the presentation ended before I could pull my graceful conclusion by pointing out the fat people in wall-e. it just occurred to me now that I could have edited the last slide to not disappear after 20 seconds. well. it's done and over with and was such a nice change from the presentations in kovalcin's class I had to do. my professor added a few of his own comments after I was done and thought my spin was fairly unique. I hope not too many people know of the article &quot;a brief rant on the future of interaction design&quot; because I pulled several points from it and while my viewpoint was honest, I'm not the first person to think this way and hope I didn't cite the article too many times and make it seem like plagiarism.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>what's left now is to lightly, carefree-ly study for my research methods test tomorrow and then wing the computer graphics project, which will probably mean staying up all of thursday night with sam. I'm not particularly worried about whether or not we finish it, which is awfully strange. there is no way I'll be toiling away at the project at all for the rest of friday because I'll be on a soaring homebound plane.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night, after I had tapped out my 750:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>she plays temple run on my phone. she whoops and gasps as the game speeds up. I concentrate on the look of concentration on her face. she is so adorable.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I look her in the eyes every time she laughs at something I say. her eyes narrow and her teeth shine when she smiles. she shakes a bit when she giggles.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I go with david and sam on a late night wendy's run. we drive up to the drive-thru and order 50 chicken nuggets but they can only give us ten so david gets us four burgers instead and I lose the last burger to them via rock-paper-scissors. I go to bed not full, but not hungry that night.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>2100 sam and I aren't hungry but we stay with mike as he eats lunch in the shade of the parking deck, on the ledge right in front of his car.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>afterwards sam returns to his room for study, while I elect to go back to mine and spend my time on a little bit of nothing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I reach the love building slightly late and realize hannah's behind me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I walk in and I see she's in summer wear. I don't think I've ever seen her look like that before. I casually comment about it to her and she asks what about last year where were you last march and I don't know. maybe the reason I can't recall her is [chime].</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm with two people I don't normally talk to a lot as we set out on our prayer walk, but I feel fine with it. the feeling of togetherness while walking mostly alone, instead of feeling so alone when I'm with people, is so rare. I felt content, even though the prayer walk I think wasn't as fulfilling as I had hoped. we stopped three times in our route circling around campus to pray together. I prayed the third time. I thought we should have been praying while we were walking but instead we just casually talked while I stayed in my silence. it was warm outside. I found it easy to smile outside. we're the first group to get back even though we had one of the longest walks to walk. and we weren't even walking quickly.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we have ourselves a barbecue in front of maulding today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I do silly things but she smiles widely when I look out the corner of my eye and I don't care how silly I might have looked because she laughed at me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I leave the group after shying out of asking for a hug from her. I wanted to study for tomorrow's research methods test, which I actually briefly chat with her about. she reminded me of the time I didn't realize I had a psyc test until an hour before class. that was at least an entire semester ago and she remembers.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I left the group now about half an hour ago and instead of sitting at starbucks looking over research methods notes I'm still planted in my room churning out words. but I'm going soon, soon..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it'll be two weeks until I see her again.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
03-15; thursday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today I paused. something beckoned to me so I sit down in one of the chairs by skiles walkway by myself and I was going to take my computer out but whatever it was that told me to sit stays me. I notice an older man a few tables away with his arms crossed staring out across the field. I look up at the sky and think to myself and concentrate and think until some part of reality seems to dissolve and I forget where I am and the ordinary becomes unreal. I stare at the clouds. they're thick today and super bright and plumy and look like weightless cauliflower, white smoke, an explosion. a passenger jet is a grey shadow swimming through the sky thousands of feet in the air. it's a little low and flits in and out of the clouds before disappearing behind a big towering one that I can't see through. there's a spider above my face, hanging from its thread that I can't see. it doesn't look like it's flying even though it's suspended in the air, its legs are scrambling. I try taking a picture of it but the camera decides to focus on the tree branches instead of the spider. a tiny little beetle thing two millimeters long falls from the sky onto the table on its back. I lower my finger onto it until it grabs on and then it spreads its wings and it flies.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I wake up an hour later than I had planned to, giving me nine hours of sleep which should be enough to prepare for tonight's anticipated all nighter. the psyc test today went a-kay-o and hopefully there won't be any surprises there. I wasn't expecting sam and allison to be waiting for me outside the room because I used almost the entire hour and a half of test time, and it's a bit funny because I wouldn't even have seen them if I hadn't decided to make for the stairs at the end of the hallway, which I don't usually.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>her hugs are my best dreams. I wish I could have one every night. it starts before I know it and I can never remember what happens during one. I wish it'd last a little bit longer. I wish I was more aware so I could appreciate and feel and sink into what's happening. it happens all too fast and I wake up too soon.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night as I finally leave my ream to head for starbucks I see her and him again. he goes to his room to change because they're going off together to shoot some hoops. we talk. he comes back. he gives me a bro hug. she hugs me and says a simple &quot;have a nice spring break.&quot; I mess up my hug with her again. we part.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm considering handing my ipad in to best buy for $265.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I've been in sam's room for about four hours now, minus an hour when we and mike and henry went out to eat at wendy's. it's 10:34 now and my drowsiness doesn't typically set in until around 1. staying up all night with sam to &quot;work&quot; on our graphics project is almost going to be fun, probably because for some reason I don't really care about not finishing it. I say not finishing, because I honestly can't foresee how we're going to figure it all out in one night, with little help from the few people in the class sam knows, and I'm just not worried..a can of monster from around two weeks ago is all I have to combat my upcoming deadening tiredness.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I don't have a window seat on the plane back home, but at least it's the on the side of the plane with two seats and given how tired I'll be by the time I get on the plane I'll most likely end up sleeping through the flight anyways. this may mean that I'll be better off not driving home too.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I miss instant messaging. I only open aim twice a year and that's only for fun, to see the names of people I used to chat with who'd usually only ask me for homework. the breathlessness as whoever-it-is-on-the-other-side is typing. going away and back. signing off and on. annoying online behaviors. chatting with [lobster]. these days I already spend so little time on gmail and facebook and I'm never online on chat anymore. I miss it, in a way. but who do I chat with now?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
03-16; friday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it's 5:46 am today. sam and I gave up working on the graphics project long ago. unfortunately I have little faith in either of us advancing any further right now. I'm pretty sure the parts we have done will only net us the bare minimum of points since we don't have anything that draws and haven't coded any of the math-y parts that are the real heart of the ray tracing project. oh well. it's been a while since I've been this defeated by a computer project. but it seems that much better when I'm not alone. we jammed to two and a half hours of switchfoot during the night's early hours.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>there is no way I'm sitting through UI design tomorrow morning but I still want to watch the rest of the pecha kucha presentations in english. hopefully after that I'll see mike at the culc and we'll be able to hang out during my last hours before spring break. today really was a kind of friday.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>oddly I haven't yet crossed my record time that I've stayed up this year. that stands at around 6:30. sam's roommates are still watching tv. incredible.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I think the can of monster actually worked because I didn't dying until around 4am.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>there's now simply nothing to do for the next three to four hours and I'm not going to bother sleeping and I'm bored.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it's 6:38 now. it occurred to me that I probably won't get very much writing done tomorrow so I'll tack on a few more lines now. sam's passed out.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>oh snap, I wonder if my alarm clock will ring. I don't think I turned it on..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm playing galcon with both the ipad and my iphone and I'm fairly wide awake.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it's almost 7am but it's still dark outside. starbucks will open soon.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I should return to my room a while before 10 so I can eat something and maybe shower too..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>oh hello.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I almost lost my phone today. I left it on one of the little table things the chairs are put around on the first floor in the culc and got up and went to the bathroom and decided to go back to the chairs area instead of to my english classroom or somewhere and noticed my phone still sitting there. I hadn't realized in the time I was away. I would have had one of those heart attacks if I did. but not only did I not have one, but it was still there by the time I happened to go back..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a bunch of kids who are in the room before me are all chatting and making fun of our professor and the pecha kucha presentations we're finishing up today. it's usually rather quiet in the room before our professor walks in, and I'm not sure why everyone was talking slightly trashy about him. a couple people cited our lack of use for twitter than we had been promised at the beginning of the year.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I fall asleep several times for several seconds during the presentations.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I've been up for 25 hours and feel fairly fine.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and mike texts to tell me he won't be able to meet me here at the culc, sorries. somewhat disappointed, but hardly surprised that such a thing happened again. oh well.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I skimmed through an article online about a man who woke up after some medical procedure with a strange case of uncontrollable laughter that he and his wife have had to deal with for the last three years. I think for a moment about laughter and laughing and how strange the action seems. it's one of my favorite things to do. I'm sitting at starbucks again and I'm looking around but only one person's smiling (not me). everybody is spread out across the tables with several seats in between all of us. we're all by ourselves staring at computers with some sad looks on our faces.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>one more class standing in between me and my plane.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>2307 I almost thought I wouldn't be able to finish all of my words today because I wouldn't be at a computer for about 7 hours since I'd be flying. but then I realized that I'd get home an hour and a half or so before midnight and here I am now.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I give sam and mike little awkward one-armed hugs. she was with us with some guy named alex and they were all going off to do something but she left first by herself without saying bye to me a second time. I sincerely doubt it but I wonder if she just happened to have been thinking the way I often have when I resign and just leave her..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a guy in line behind me at the gate starts a conversation with me which I awkward am only somewhat able to maintain. he asks me if I'm on flight 504. I'm pretty sure he knew this was flight 504, in which case I wonder what prompted him to talk to me. and then what prompted him to just leave me standing there outside the gate after the plane landed because he had told me to meet him after the flight so he could give me his email address because I had mentioned I was looking for an internship and when I waited for him he said a hasty bye and strode off. what did I do wrong?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>dad drove the camry to the airport which slightly disappoints me but I drive anyway and am content. the car is silent as it always is with my dad, slightly strained.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I saw ryan at the train station and airport and I don't know if he saw me too but we basically ignore each other.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>home feels a little less unreal every time I go back. mom snaps at brother. same old same old, no increase in discipline, rather the other way around in some senses, with her actually acquiescing to some of his requests.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I drive down church road in the dark. the old familiar.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'll have more tomorrow I'm sure.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
03-17; saturday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>oh man a way too late start today and I'm hoping I won't have to resort to cheating to get past 750 within about 20 minutes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today I slept until 2:30 and it wasn't until 3 that I walked downstairs where my mom was in the kitchen and my brother on his computer in the dining room. things haven't changed a whole lot here. I ate..lunch (lunch description) and then I went out for a walk with my mom in a neighborhood trail, something which I think I might have been willing to do a few months ago. it was good bonding time, something I never really appreciated before with anybody in my family. I don't like admitting it to myself, but I need a lot more of this, and this needs to be more intimate. how it'll ever happen, though, I don't know.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we went right back home after that, and I wanted to go out somewhere on my own but ended up playing a sizable portion of my tenth round of dead space 2 while my brother satisfyingly watched a good part of my gameplay.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I ordered pizza tonight. first night and pizza already..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>during our walk I saw a black toyota camry drive down a newer, smoothly paved road and somehow that, combined with simply the trees and grass and blue sky and wood fences really gave me a warm sense of home. home as in just the atmosphere and environment, coupled with the fact that I'm in new jersey once again and in a quiet, surburban area close to my house. it made me want to drive too, want to drive a cheap average looking car, like the camry. not a shiny luxury one. even though we have a bmw but the thought of driving a mercedes through the same road didn't have the same warm feeling that thinking about being the driver of that black camry gave me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my mom mentioned to me about how our house parties that we have with our old family friends have changed over the years. we've been having them every year during the holidays, thanksgiving, christmas, new year's, whatnot, always with the same group of four or five families. and while our parents are all wonderful friends and have all known each other for a really long time, some since before I was born (probably..maybe. at least since when I was incredibly young), the same can so not be said for me and all their kids. our classic activity used to be hours long super smash bros. gaming sessions; the game would be almost the only one that we would play and in fact pretty much all that we'd do for the 10-12 hours we'd stay, besides eating (sometimes I'd skip meals for that game and just munch on what my mom would feed me). every year it's gotten less and less sociable as we started getting laptops and playing games on our computers. I remember being taken aback when one of my friends would bring his own laptop. a computer? bring to someone else's house during a party? it used to be something unheard of for me. my parents and I would arrive late and everyone would rejoice because I meant smash bros. and we all would finally have something to do instead of playing plain online games on the computer, and I clearly recall how that rejoicing diminished until now we barely socialize at all and we never play the game anymore. so much that I still beat myself over driving back home to pick up the wii during the last party we had for new year's. I had even made sure that if I did bring it, everyone would actually get up and play with me, and I was not surprised when no one moved after I had gotten back. disappointed. I spent the rest of that night alone on the couch facing the window listening to music through new over-ear headphones that were uncomfortable and that I had to take off every once in a while.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so that's all gone. we're by ourselves now. the seemingly typical future visions of people never talking to each other anymore and all ensnared in their virtual worlds projected into their faces is becoming a reality after all, isn't it, no matter how cheesy it seems every time we try to point out to friends examples, because a lot of the times we never really realize it happening right in front of us</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
03-18; sunday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>as always, being at home changes things. every day is a lazy day and it's getting harder for me to push myself to write these every day. I'm holding back on the writing until 11 at night now, but luckily the don't break the chain motivation is strong enough to keep me moving.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm too lazy to brush my teeth tonight and just want to snack on my special k bars while finishing up my dead space game.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I spent over three hundred dollars today while driving around from store to store for almost four hours. I did in fact go to best buy and trade in my ipad 2 for $265. I then promptly splurged 160 of it on a 1.5tb seagate portable hard drive. I'll figure out what to waste the remaining $110 on sometime in the following week as I won't be able to go to another best buy for a while. I could get a mouse, or a cooling pad if it'll fit in my backpack without my parents noticing on the way home, or an ipod nano..and I'd have to hide it all from my friends so they won't how much of everything I waste on useless electronics. I had simply left sam ipad-less as I left for home..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I then went to the apple store and looked at their earphone selection and decided on these ultimate ears 600vi's, which made my wallet $130 lighter. hopefully I'll be satisfied..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my last stop today was barnes &amp; noble where I spent over $30 on lolita, the hunger games, and a little set of two small moleskine ruled notebooks. let's see if I'll actually end up writing anything in them..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>driving almost guiltily down the same old stretches of route 18 and route 9 over and over again knowingly wasting gas and the boring last drive home.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>things were uneventful today and I can't find much to talk about.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking about my &quot;ocd&quot; problem and the dots on my foot more and more distresses me. the doctors my mom have talked to said visiting them would be unnecessary. I just want to be unaware again. ignorance always was bliss..and you can't even appreciate it while you have it because you're unaware.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>here's something I forgot to mention yesterday. it seems my brother cares more than I thought about himself, and his education, and whatnot. similar issues to the ones I had when applying for the science and engineering program. when he found that he didn't make it in while all his friends did he was fairly distraught. it was a stunningly quiet car ride home that afternoon, as my mom relayed to me. so similar to me, I thought. I had seemingly barely made it in while my middle school friends were well in the zone.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I barely even try sometimes, I definitely work at nowhere near my full capacity, like a supercar whose driver has never pushed it past 60. I wonder about all the things I could do and clean up in my life if I bothered working. I just wonder what I spend all my mental capacity on. it's not gaming anymore, and I'm still adamant that games don't take up a huge part of my time despite the 80 hours I've put into ds2. that's only because it's just one game that I'm drawn to for long periods of time rather than a whole slew.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I do need a hobby. she had said so too. when people ask me what I do in my spare time, what I spend all my time on, every time I embarrassingly shrug off the question that I so desperately want an answer to. I still don't know what I'm doing every day. nothing but browsing blogs? I don't spend hours scrolling through tumblr anymore, and intentional time waster browsing sessions on the likes of 9gag seem sparse and occasional. a riddle, like one of those trick math money questions where a dollar goes missing. I don't see many options for myself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my praying is once again slipping too. it doesn't help that it had already started doing so in the few weeks leading up to break. I think I had been holding off until this week to start regularly exercising my routines again and pick up a copy of the Bible and read verses everyday without realizing I've just been kidding myself again and subconsciously delaying myself so I won't have to really work at anything at all. I too much time dreaming about how to eradicate all un-necessities and never applying anything I think of.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
03-22; thursday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>not quite sure what I was thinking when I decided it would somehow be better for me to stop writing these. because I was wrong and this is about all the motivation I can get to keep me writing since I'm successfully unable to convince myself that I'll write things and post them to my tumblr or somewhere just for the sake of writing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today I went with my mom on a little trip to the bank and found out a little more about how I'm going to be spending money while abroad. I'm still apprehensive, and will be up until the trip, about flying for ten hours on a giant crowded plane filled with people I don't know to a place so far that's so populated and alive and is somewhere where I'll feel so much more hopelessly lost than I've probably ever felt in my life. I have only myself to trust that I'll make it over barriers I've never encountered before with new people I'll have to get to know all over again. even me though, I've managed to make friends every time I've been thrown into unknown water and I still have doubts, but also faith that I'll be just fine.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'll have five days between the last day of finals and the day of my flight. shouldn't be too early to start preparing..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>one of the primary reasons I'm even considering reading the hunger games is because she's read it too, and she's mentioned that she's learned that burning wet leaves creates smoke by reading it. the movie's being released in only a day or two and I'm really not so sure I have it in myself to read the book start to finish in less than two days. I can't remember the last time I finished reading a book, just a book for fun, and I can't remember what book it was. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>distress</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I applied for three or four internship positions today, which the most I've ever done in my life. everybody else is being interviewed left and right, has an offer(s), or is already and has been working and here I am with my wheels firmly still and my engine barely coughing..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I bought my two moleskine notebooks and I once again don't know what to do with them. I hope this sort of habit shapes itself over time, as soon as I get it started at least. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>disorganization</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>that's it, I'm leaving my old ipod here. I can't ever put up with too many devices to manage. I can never organize it all perfectly. I have visions in my computer-oriented head about perfectly organized files on a computer, a perfect itunes library, perfect copies of movies. it shouldn't be too hard to simply completely drop it instead of trying to perpetually refine it into something I can never make it be, something that I can't make myself realize doesn't matter.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>maybe what's difficult is finding something else that's better worth concentrating on and putting my effort into. once I find whatever-it-is, I'll be able to stop it with my electronic digital life and all energy will be directed towards whatever-it-is, like energy shields on starships in star wars. those always fail and then all the power has to be directed to the shields covering some certain area of the ship, leaving and neglecting the other parts because oh well those don't matter as much do they.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I hadn't kept in mind how old of a book lolita is (it's 57 years old) and how it'll be a drastically different read than, say, oh the hunger games. I seriously doubt I'll have the willpower to read a book like that while I'm away at barcelona so that leaves me the less than two months between now and my departure date to plow through that while taking care of school and job finding. I doubt I'll do it because reading that is something I more easily imagine myself doing while going through some boring phase of life, perhaps while working some job, every day having become a new kind of monotony. there can't be any school, because school leaves with too much of the feeling of having no time to do anything I want to do that'll require the least bit of mental effort. so a thought just appeared, maybe I'll leave that here too..</div>

<hr/>
03-23; friday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I haven't really thought much about high school.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I got a call from thomson reuters today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I don't mean to bear ill towards sam but..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I remember an IM conversation with melanie about leaving high school. in fact I should still be able to find it somewhere in my aim logs. back when I still barely chatted online with her and well after she would actually start a conversation with me. one of the few topics recalled is mentioning to her how I was afraid I'd miss the little things about high school, like waking up to my alarm clock and walking through the hallways. of course waking up to my alarm clock was terrible, but it's just one of the small things that you're just able to fondly reminisce about and wish you paid a little more attention to in the past.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I was suddenly imagining an argument between a goofy high school senior and a teacher over being late to class, where the goofy student suddenly acts all serious with a straight face as he carefully and logically details the situation that made him late. the classroom and rows of seats with the desktops attached and wired baskets/platforms under the seats to put folders and notebooks on. the teacher's desk. blackboard. being lazy and walking from class to class with just a single folder or notebook and a random pen or pencil in pocket that found on the floor somewhere. mcleod's room. classwork and assignments simple and straightforward (compared to college). stubbornly tuning out everything outside and listening to music through sound-isolating earphones on the bus ride home. sleeping on the bus ride to school. pasta. there's little my mind can settle on there's too much.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I was surprised to get a call back this morning regarding one of the internship applications I had submitted only yesterday. sam had gotten a call three or four days after one of his. I called back with my dad next to me listening and stumbled a little, answering his questions with too-short responses but overall my voice was strong and daddy was pleased because he and mommy never hear me talk this way in front of them and thus underestimate my speaking ability. whoever the guy on the other end was reminded me of my cs3750 professor. the job involves designing applications for the iphone and ipad so my short-lived but present experience may give me a bit of boost. receiving any offer and being able to accept would mean bidding farewell to all of my summer plans in spain (which don't really consist of much anyway) but I'd gladly take a job in the summer, school with friends in the fall to proceed normally, and any semester abroad before I graduate. as long as I have a freaking car.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my dad's always encouraging me to boldly tout even the slightest of computing knowledge I may have as a skill set in which I'm presumed to be at least somewhat proficient. I'm smart, he says. I'd like to agree. all I can think of now though is how I'm going to recover from the wounds my two cs classes are inflicting on my gpa this semester. I haven't contacted my group mates for UI design in forever and I just miserably failed the ray tracing project with sam for computer graphics. I'm so averse to admitting failure to myself that I don't ever even think about it, but I'm making myself turn to face it now and I do know that I probably could have figured out the ray tracing things on my own. could have gone to the TAs, could have spent more time other the very last hours before it was due figuring out ray representations and object intersections. I'm smart, right? I should have been able to do this. instead I'm going to get a Very Bad Grade on project 3 and am really hoping I can count on myself to pick me up and drag myself through all the hindrances project 4 will bring. source of motivation where art thou.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I've also always let sam step ahead of me and figure out the first basics of every project to report to me. being too lazy to work the kinks and untangle all the knots on my own. I've made sure to never let him leave me behind. but wouldn't it be nice if I were the one to be able to leave him behind. not that I would. I'd help if I could, sure, and I'd be able to help if I could find enough gas somewhere to push myself to redline and do what I can do.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I still suck and organizing thoughts into words. tl;dr mentality. too much to sift through.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
03-24; saturday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it's 2:30 am but I'm moving forward with this since I know I won't be able to make myself write in the morning right after I wake up tomorrow.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today I hung out with lillian and sam. I met them at the rec center that's right outside manalapan high. I wasn't expecting sam there because she hadn't told me that he was going to be there with her but I wasn't surprised to see him there too. lillian called out my name upon seeing me and I said nothing and just started walking towards them. this was only the second time I've seen the two together and I can't know whether they usually act as such around each other or if they modified their behaviors because I was present. sam was fairly quiet. based on what I saw of them today I would never guess that they were together if I hadn't known already. though I can't be sure if that is due to my lack of any sort of experience in this environment, or again, if this was not their natural behavior.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we walked around in the fields for around an hour because lillian was waiting for her brother to finish his tennis tryouts and she dropped her dog poofy down a slide where sam and I failed to catch him and afterwards he became afraid of the slide. poofy would chase after her and neither of us. a girl and her mother stopped and absolutely adored poofy, the girl was just squealing with delight and her mother kept forgetting that poofy is a he-dog. I couldn't not notice lillian and sam become visibly more awkward and tense and quieter around them as they were petting. I found myself imaging how sam (L) would behave in the same situation and knew that he'd be different, more sociable, more normal. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>when lillian's brother was done I followed them in her car to her house. both sam and her brother sat in the back seat. why..?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>her brother opted to stay at home while the rest of us went to wendy's. I followed my techie friends' example and ordered things off the dollar menu while I listened to sam and lil order five-dollar combo meals.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we talked and chatted about various school things, high school teacher things and college things. apparently the physics teacher who had replaced mr. kovalcin is seriously lacking in all sorts of expertise, which got me a little worried about how my own brother would fare in s/e.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sam's dad came to pick him up. he came in unexpectedly and I watched lil awkwardly say hi and avoid eye contact with him. I hadn't seem him since the day I went to six flags with a bunch of friends from lil's s/e class, where on the way back lil and sam listened to me having some seriously strained conversation with sam's dad in the car. she's afraid of his dad, lil tells me. not surprised.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back at lillian's house she hands me my physics notes that I had lent her a year or so ago. I was a little happy when she mentioned how my physics sand calc 3 notes are just about the only things that she and a good portion of the rest of her class have to depend on. she then gives me a fairly terrible hug.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I had a lot of dreams this morning. I was able to remember and write down snippets from four different instances. if the fact that we forget some 90% of what we dream within minutes of waking up is true then I must have dreamt up entire worlds' worth of stuff. I really wish I knew what it all was.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my mom opened up a new bank account for me today after we found out cashing traveler's cheques came with hefty fees overseas. the lady knew my mom and was very nice and a bit passionate about europe. I was still quiet and misunderstood one of her questions. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm suddenly hoping I can find a job somewhere over the summer and cancel my study abroad plans for the summer and instead go abroad some other time during a fall or spring semester. that way I'd finally make some money over the summer and get to stay at school with my friends for the fall instead of having a twisted up summer across the sea and miserable-seeming fall semester working. the single phone call I received yesterday is all it's taking to fill me up with hope at the possibility of getting an offer somewhere.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
03-25; sunday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last hours before heading back into georgia. I saw several facebook status updates by people making note of the joy felt at being back at tech. I scowl inside as I read them and look at the people who liked them. posts by tam. I almost taste disgust as I log off.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>as per usual I've never given a thought about reverting to my tech lifestyle. it'll be back to no car, no clean bathroom, no walking around the house barefoot, no food, no brightly lit room. back to sleeping hungry, exhausted-ly turning off the computer before showering and going to bed, to avoiding touching my roommate's stuff, to lonely weekend grocery trips that end up taking two hours because I have to wait for the shuttle. I'm embittered, but I know as always that I shouldn't. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>seeing some of the relatively high gpa requirements for the internship applications I've been seeing while searching is lighting a spark within me that hopefully will lead to some motivation to keep me maintaining the gpa that I was barely able to hold onto last semester. I've already slipped and fallen back a lot this time around with my two cs classes, and I don't know how I'm going to overcome the overwhelming feeling of laziness that I've felt almost physically stifling me, numbing my limbs and my mind so that I can't muster up the energy to get up on my feet. I'm ready to leave my friend in my (thin) dust should that prove necessary, and it'd very likely be quite satisfying but it's something I'll have to make happen.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm not quite sure what I got myself into today as I went on a downloading spree and bought five games whose prices had been slashed by 75%. one is deus ex: human revolution and the other four are all tomb raider games. so far I've been fairly aware to not begin putting any of my stake into these games, though I've already found myself thinking about the high-end specs of a future laptop I'd buy myself that would now have to accommodate game-playing too. I'm going to stay sharp and careful to not allow myself to sink into deus ex and tomb raider lara croft world as my graphics projects become harder and I have more to work on for UI design and research methods also. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>oh I have to remember to do those fucking poems in my pocket. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I finally renamed my tumblr to a name nobody I know will be able to trace to me. the only tie left now is my coquerel's sifaka picture which I'll need to change too..and of course existing follower friends who know me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my mom called my grandmother for me again tonight. I feel awful while talking to her but always let it easily slip away as soon as the poorly held conversation is terminated. my brother is always uninterested in speaking to her and our grandfather too, but so am I, though I'd like to think to a lesser degree. it's been almost six years since I've last been to china to visit her and since then, from what little I've gathered from my mom, her health has deteriorated a lot and she's lost weight and gotten skinny and come to think of it just now..she's nearing her time. I feel a little guilty for the thought crossing my mind and I don't think about her enough to be able to fully even regret not having the close, warm type of relationship so often valued between children and their grandparents in closer-knit families. I think the only thing I can do now that'll put my own heart at peace is to wholeheartedly pray for them, and although the consideration embraces me now, I have so little faith in myself that I almost know I won't do so even tonight when I close this laptop lid and go to sleep. what must I do to save myself?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>tear me away from me and do what's necessary to satisfy my heart.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm so sorry.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I say so with my lip trembling and tears in my heart but I don't pay attention to my own words and neither does the one I'm speaking to. they pour out of my mouth substanceless and weightless and meaningless and slip through your ears and don't even leave them ringing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>truth stirs your heart and takes your heart and takes all that you are and shakes you until you start crying with the meaning you suddenly see with your heart.</div>
<div><br/></div>

03-26; monday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I elect to not sit at starbucks today. something came in my head and told me it's harder to concentrate there. instead I'm on the third CULC floor which bears more resemblance to the fourth CULC floor that I always used to sit at last semester. I'm not at the student center eating a chicken sandwich for once because I actually ate a breakfast this morning after feeling unexpectedly refreshed waking up unexpectedly early. now I'm listening to gas (mat jarvis) churning out the words being produced in my mind after getting over my inability to begin.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I wake up at 7:30 and feel perfectly fine. even during most of last fall when I routinely had to be jarred awake before 7am I had never felt this awake. I had swallowed a melatonin pill the night before but I thought those were supposed to make me sleepy. I did manage to fall asleep some three hours earlier than the night before.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>that dreamy back-at-tech feeling had weak effects on me when I got back to my apartment last night. I hear michelle's voice through the door, laughing. I open the door and walk in and she's the only one who seems happy to see me. phammy stares at me, while fucking kenny is behind the wall and the first thing he says is &quot;oh you've been in jersey this whole time I'm so sorry.&quot; I ignore him. I don't think I'm mad about him insulting my home but his comment just significantly reinforced the very strong annoyance I already hold towards him. in the next few minutes several potential comebacks form in my mind, without even much effort. who the fuck does he think is? coming up with a what-he-thinks is a smartass comment and then executing it disgustingly drably.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I never understand peoples' reactions when I tell them I'm from new jersey. maybe I just know too little about my home state. and I have never watched and have no interest in seeing the show jersey shore. their reactions always seem to lean towards negativity, on the verge of expressing aversion. I can't confirm if the things they seem to think about NJ are true.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I had a strange &quot;oh holy fuck, I'm 30000 feet in the fucking sky&quot; realization after snapping awake from the mini-naps I kept having on the plane yesterday. I fly often enough now for the experience to have become a lot less remarkable. what novelty it had is slipping away. I had an aisle seat this time so I couldn't see much looking out the window during takeoff. sally sat in the row right in front of me and we hardly talked at all. she didn't wait for me after getting off the plane either.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this morning I heard the telltale brake squeals of a stinger shuttle for the first time in a week, while walking down 6th street. it reminded me again that here I am back at tech. when I didn't really want to be reminded of the fact anymore at all.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I got this from paradoxicalsentiments:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>“you know that point in your life when you realize the house you grew up in isn’t really your home anymore? all of a sudden even though you have some place where you put your shit, that idea of home is gone. you’ll see one day when you move out it just sort of happens one day and it’s gone. you feel like you can never get it back. it’s like you feel homesick for a place that doesn’t even exist. you won’t ever have this feeling again until you create a new idea of home for yourself. I don’t know, but I miss the idea of it, you know” - garden state</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and I'm thinking my house has reached that point. it didn't feel like a home base, a mothership, a place with protective walls to sleep behind. and since school sure as hell does not feel like such a place either, I've found another question for myself, which I'll be able to answer once I get home, but since I don't know where home is anymore I don't know the answer</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>can't say I'm surprised that break seemed to never have happened when sam walked in the classroom. I'm kind of disappointed that I thought it'd be any different. the first thing he did was to show me the paperwork that had to be filled out for him to get his windows phone from the microsoft store. I thought he had already won one without me, and I was going to content myself by not being mad about it much at all, but later I realized that he actually hadn't won a phone yet and that he had yet to go, which most likely means I'll be able to go with. I'm already getting excited about getting a new phone, don't really know what I'm getting myself into, and am readying my iphone for a complete erase.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
03-27; tuesday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm back at starbucks today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I had gotten myself so excited over going to the microsoft store with sam that I spent some time turning off all the icloud features on my phone and logging out of every app that I have to log into to use, like tumblr and evernote and etsy, to clear out any personal information to prepare my phone for a complete erase upon switching it for a windows phone. the more I'm thinking about it now though the more I'm realizing that I probably won't be able to get a new phone at all because of all these contract issues. sam had showed me plenty of paperwork yesterday and my mom just warned me to not sign anything until I'm absolutely sure of what I'm agreeing to and I have no idea what I'll be agreeing to should I go through with this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>she sends out the email so I will seeing her tonight after all. I'm nervous. not, I'm quite sure, of seeing her or asking her for a hug, but of the sight of her crumbling my paper walls again. my walls that are only able to fragilely stand in air that's absolutely still. but she, she's a hurricane and I'm so so frightened that once my eyes strike her again the paper will burn to a crisp and expose my heart and make me feel raw again. it'll hurt again, I'll lay stiff and unable to move. I always feel slightly devastated when I think about the mess that's me that she's evilly dissolving without a second thought because she has, no, clue, what she can do to me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I get an A on my research methods test and an A- on my first full report. I score nine points higher than sam. it made me a bit happy, but it's only a tiny little thing so I stop me from getting ahead of myself here. it's nothing, really.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this is from about a week ago: what are all the tiny things I’m constantly doing that I’m obsessing over and that are swallowing every day’s hours? basically my what do I spend all my time doing question. I can’t figure out because I never really give it much thought because the important things always blissfully fade and give way to current satisfactions unless my mom enters my room and lectures me time and time again.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I feel ridiculous.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>whenever I manage to pull priorities up to the surface so that they’re all I think about for an hour or two. desperately trying to hold on as it all slips through wet fingers again and sinks back to the bottom, like a retreat high, or cleared sinuses that clog back up after a sneeze. I wish I knew how to make motivation stay.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>maybe I already have too much and am too lazy to work for more.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>small group just finished and since a few of us are actually considering going to watch the hunger games I'm finishing this as soon as I can, but I doubt we're actually going to go anywhere.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so I see her and it's all the same. I make sure to smile when I look at her. it's usually after cracking a joke, big or little, so she's smiling too. my heart doesn't race too much. she's close to her friend. I try to not care. I don't care. it doesn't matter to me. anymore. it's not for me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my application for this week is to smile at people I walk past when I manage to make eye contact with them. followed by silence when I announced it. they twisted it into making it sound creepy, completely unsurprisingly. what actually surprised me is the positive response I got afterwards. I knew it was a little weird, which is a little part of the reason I said it. I enjoy it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the typically unspoken-of lack of eye contact that becomes obvious every time someone is asked to pray is voiced this time because of the application I had assigned myself and I end up..chosen. I made sure to include a nice clever word choice which completed it. I didn't say a lot, and my prayer lasted probably less than thirty seconds. it made me want to pray more. for practice. I keep thinking I want to do things for the wrong reasons. not bad, malicious reasons. they can be selfish though.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I mentioned a quote while discussing the ways we react to the bad things that happen to us. “We have no right to ask when a sorrow comes, 'Why did this happen to me?' unless we ask the same question for every joy that comes our way.” I had no one to give credit to, but I did say I didn't come up with it. wouldn't have been to guess that it wasn't mine anyway.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>david comes in the room, earlier than he usually does I think. on second thought it may have been because we started an hour later since she had a test today. it's weird. I wonder what he's doing here all the time but he mentions that he visits the thursday group too, diminishing the threat a bit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
03-28; wednesday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>he strokes her hair. I don't know whether I'm surprised. I wonder what's going through her mind as he does it. they're both cute. she's curled up on the couch with her eyes closed, looking very content. my biggest problem is being unable to decide whether to stare at her or to try to look away. like two like poles of two magnets resisting each other, but bring them too close and one will whip around and smash into the other. I'm that one.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>bring two magnets' like poles together and they resist, until they too close together. then one of them will fall head over heels, whip around, and latch onto the other with all it's got. they sit next to each other awkwardly, neither moving. the force holding one to the other is invisible, but good luck prying them apart. I haven't managed to do that yet.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>interaction with my group mates during english class is tense and awkward. one is absent, most likely sleeping through class again. another cracks strange jokes referring to things I don't know and bestows plenty of that-awkward-moment-when-mkeeps sliding my laptop across the desk surface and resizes my chrome window and nearly went to the liberty of changing my trackpad settings to deselect natural scrolling. fuck you. the last member of our group, she at least asked &quot;may I?&quot; before using my computer. both of them admired my little totoro decal I have stuck on the left palmrest area. she asked me if I had seen any of miyazaki's other movies and I sadly had to reply mostly no because the only other one I've seen is howl's moving castle.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I bump into hayson on the stairs and we see each other and he stops walking and I stop walking and we have smiley chat in the middle of the stairs. it's not a bad thing at all.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>then I bump into jeffrey at the food court and feel awkward again walking away from him after ordering my food only to wait for him because just leaving can't be right and then walking again after paying for my food only to wait for him and then finally sitting with him where our conversation isn't strained but I'm still too quiet. I'm always worried about my ability to carry on a conversation especially with people I'm just slightly acquainted with, but have never truly hung out with. he leaves before I do but invites me to chill under the couch. I don't know if I should go. out of my way to see if he's there. I would still say lunch with him was cool though.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sam jokingly asks me &quot;are you sure you want a windows phone?&quot; after graphics class. I get surprised because I thought we weren't going to get any new phones. mike would meet us at sam's apartment. they ate lunch outside while I just sat and played with mike's phone because I wasn't hungry and had no food. for an hour or so while hanging out we'd keep touching upon whether or not we'd go to the mall. I would have said yes, but the both of them were so hesitant that I was very sure we'd go nowhere. plus I can't imagine going anywhere off campus on a wednesday afternoon, so it wasn't hard to see that we wouldn't be leaving. maybe it's another asian thing. talking and discussing about going for so long that we left ourselves with no time. I would have just left and gone.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>while we were outside I thought for a moment about the gay (happy) relationship between all of us. I've been trying to pinpoint the root of the differences between our type of friendship and the more usual-seeming ones between guys like me and V and the high school kids I always hung around. we're so nice to each other. we barely even tease, let alone whip out the inane insults that dude friends usually pass around. we don't make dirty jokes, and always seem to shy away from them whenever one peeks out at us. then we get a little tense and are a bit afraid to laugh. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>noob</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>or am I just seeing these in my head? seeing what I want to see? is this something I want to see? not being some of these ways, to me, is to be freer. I should just say whatever I want even when around them. I'll swear if I want to. it makes me feel like I'm better than the rest of them. which is twisted, because I'm not. but even though my heart lies with these types of people, the limitations I can feel are still barring parts of me from completing my image..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'll start the night's writing off with some reflection on ACF's message on idolatry we had today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the speaker did a pretty good job. she quoted verses from Samuel about saul and how he put his own desires before God's desires. she spoke about idols and idolatry and the reasons we fall so hard for them. she went over two &quot;monuments&quot; we build for ourselves to worship, often before we turn to God. ego and vows. her message revealed more to me and about me than I thought it would. which is a good thing of course. I thought about the ways I like to think I'm different from others and how one of reasons I like that in me is because they make me feel like I'm better than those around me. I feel smug and above them. think about it long enough and I almost look down upon my friends scornfully at times. that can't be the right, loving way to go, can it. I vowed to continue acting the way I want to, but only because it makes me me and not because it would make me feel above other people. that was my ego. many of the things that preoccupy me that I tried to relate to what she was saying were stupid, like my life being centered around electronics. but I'm already working on giving them up and finding more valuable things to revolve my life around! (the speaker's name is jinny) jinny mentioned her friend's heartbreak and that it had once prompted her to vow to never give her whole heart to a boy, ever. that was her example. how she strove to be perfect but became physically weak and realized perfection would be nothing if she couldn't even walk without leaning on somebody. morals are to not make vows and deflate our egos.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm in the car that's first to arrive at moe's, where we eat tonight. the others arrive shortly after and I order a fried shrimp sandwich with mac &amp; cheese and banana pudding. she mentions that it's good. I'm able to talk to her smiling and surprise! sit next to her. david prays for our table: chris, louisa, alex, kelly, himself, me, and her. we eat and she looks at me and I'm not much of a body. our table is right in front of a small band playing live music which is very loud. I steal mike's phone and use it to send sam and diana spam texts. everyone at our table leaves earlier than the others, who laugh as I pull mike's phone out of my pocket when he realizes it's missing but I quickly away dramatically, almost forgetting to say good-bye.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I hear her laugh echo down the hall shortly after I arrive back at my room. she's could be with him in his room.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
03-29; thursday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>here's what went on today:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I woke up earlier than I usually wake on thursdays in order to meet sam at the parking deck so we could go to the mall for the windows phone challenge. I had managed to mostly finish my math homework last night, drawing rage faces for a couple of the problems I didn't feel like doing. I see sam and david and we climb into his car and are on our way.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I relish the feeling of the car accelerating. david's car isn't exactly fast but feeling even a slight force on my back as he just edges up in speed from around 60mph is all but euphoric. I'm a little bit tired too. sam's 11am alarm goes off. we joke about him needing at alarm at 11 to wake up.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the sight of lenox square mall is guiltily familiar, as I had made the trip over on my own several times last year on ventures to the fucking apple store, of all places. david likes parking on the parking deck and we park at the top floor of the parking deck facing a black ferrari FF. then we hear what most likely is its engine as we make our way down to the entrance to macy's, where we loiter while waiting for one of sam's friends to give him an old phone to trade. they upload the pictures they took of the car to facebook and get several likes and comments within minutes. I halfheartedly convey some of my facebook woes to sam, who I don't think dwells on it very much. why would he, after all.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I turn and without warning henry and some girl he and sam know are walking towards us and if I'm annoyed, it's not because henry is here but because sam never told me that he would be. but based on what I overhear the meeting is only coincidental. then we encounter two more people sam knows.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I see a multicolored logo hovering over the glass entrance to the microsoft store which bears some resemblance to the apple store, only once I walk inside I see things I never see there and those are colors and a variety of laptops and smartphones that are bigger than the iphone. I get bored. there are over a hundred people in the queue for the challenge ahead of sam. he ends up taking the paperwork he had filled out earlier and simply going to the people in charge and getting a card that would net him the htc titan in a few days as the store was out of stock of all phones. I get hungry.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we leave the store to eat. I and that girl walk behind the other three of us by ourselves while they converse. perhaps she's a forever-alone type like me. sam and david get chick fil-a and I wonder why they'd pick that over anywhere else in the food court since we have chick fil-a at school.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we leave henry behind and the ferrari is gone when we get back to the car. back to school. spending the early part of today at the mall didn't feel as surreal as I thought/hoped it would.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>david calls me after class as promised to work out at the gym. he shows me a list on his phone listing all the routines we'd have to do to perform the rather intense-looking workout. about a third of the way down my arms feel ready to burst. both of us skip half the items in the list and I'm kind of hoping I didn't slow him down.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>mike is here too but opts to workout on his own. david and up go up to the fifth floor and do our final ab workout. I feel thoroughly worked out and then we meet mike again and I halfheartedly shoot hoops with them for a while. david tries to teach me the proper form and followthrough when shooting. I just carelessly toss the ball underhandedly and miss every time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>david leaves us and I suggest to mike that we play badminton and to my delight he agrees and we go right to an open court with a net already set up. I haven't played for over a year and my small fear of being unadjusted to the length of the racquet neck quickly disappear because I'm able to hit the shuttlecock just fine. my feet get sweaty and hot. it's been a long time since I've run around so much. I should probably convince mike to play tennis with me at least once before school ends.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>mike has nothing to do before 8pm, which is when some comedian is performing whom mike wants to watch. to more of my surprise and guilty delight he offers to come over and play brawl. we do just that for over an hour and I beat him in every match.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>then mike is off and I go to chick fil-a myself and here I am now finishing up the day at starbucks. I'm checking out now. I had wanted to get an early start on my psyc lab report, but reality says no.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
03-30; friday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I began this day with a bit of a nostalgia overdose, which started when I looked up &quot;disney sing along&quot; because I wasn't sure how to spell &quot;sing along.&quot; I was finally able to find the title of the ghost song I barely remembered from one of the videos I'd seen as a kid (it is &quot;grim grinning ghosts&quot; and I'm surprised it didn't give me recurring nightmares when I was young) and found all the other sing alongs from the videotape all uploaded by a youtube user and saw them all. I felt my heart cry a little bit inside at the last song &quot;when you wish upon a star.&quot; it began with all the kids leaving the disneyland park, the disney characters cheerfully and sadly waving them good-bye. I felt like one of them. they were all laughing and running as they left, many of them I imagine not knowing what they're leaving behind. I wondered who they all were and how old all of them are now and what they're doing and how many of them even know or remember that they're in that video.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>from there I briefly pondered the lightning paced, always transient state of things today. I had watched disney sing alongs time and time and time again and well I can't know I forgot something if I don't remember it and I had forgotten a lot. what will I remember about today in ten years? what's remarkable and worth remembering, fondly recalling, will remain concrete enough to satisfyingly swim through in reminiscence? I guess I'll know in ten years, but try to pay attention to everything for now.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>newness my childhood, not-my childhood fastness</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I skipped the morning's 9am class because since english is canceled, no force in the world would be able to make me wake up early to go to UI design too. sam left right after graphics to go to a lock-in for his church. if david hosts us a friday night hangout I won't be seeing her there either. enoch's &quot;lunch party&quot; is less eventful than usual because everybody else who had joined left before I got there. I was the only guy who refused to play games on his smartphone. at least until she left. she didn't talk to any of us much after her friend came and joined us though.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>short day today. that's all that's happened so far. there's something called tech beautification day going on tomorrow and I don't know how mike's GIGs is going to tie in with that so I'm thinking there's a possibility not much will go on tomorrow.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this morning I reread an article on thought catalog titled &quot;what it's like going back to your high school.&quot; I couldn't relate so much to the feelings the author expressed towards being back in a place as oddly familiar as one's high school because I've refused to let myself pay a visit to mine. the thing that caught me was a short bit towards the end when she described putting too much value in newness. that &quot;perhaps the problem is not that things don't feel new anymore. perhaps the problem is that I need things to feel fresh in order for them to feel valuable.&quot; the feeling of newness is oftentimes one of the things I miss most about old things. old things that you have to wait forever before revisiting in order to be able to get a taste of the newness in them again. do I put too much value and importance in newness too? &quot;the land I grew up on..now it's a burning field.&quot; the things that are impossible to touch when they're in front of you, when they fill you. that you only realize were there when you look back with different eyes. and that are still impossible to pick up and hold because now that you're able to see them, they're not there anymore.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it's almost 9.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I have just received word that GIGs tomorrow will in fact continue normally more or less as planned. don't know what all the tech beautification day fuss is about. I just wasted hours replaying portal 2 and will spend the rest of the day's hours at david's, where she won't be, hanging out and chilling and perhaps watching the secret of kells. I'm considering skipping out tomorrow because my workload that I can't manage if I'm not given way ample time. so I'll shop and try to muster the effort to help out with the fucking coding for the UI group project. hopefully I'll dedicate more time to thought next week after the fucking project and lab report are due. I'll text lisa too…</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
03-31; saturday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I almost forgot about this task for today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I woke up early for a weekend. what's with all the early waking all week? I opened my eyes and it was around 9am and my arms felt incredibly sore. I couldn't fully extend them. my lower back has felt sore all day and no amount of stretching seems to be doing any good.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I ate breakfast/lunch at the dining hall. I don't like eating there but I had no food and no choice. playing galcon while eating made me miss a grocery shuttle by about a minute, that I could have made if I had run or jogged. but I didn't. I took the bus to target and now that its grocery section is finally set up, I have no need to walk over to publix anymore so that was convenient. I deleted several things from my shopping list after deciding to avoid buying them; I didn't buy any movie or mouse and almost abstained from buying the hunger games soundtrack as well but put the cd back in my basket after putting the $40 mouse back. I found an acne treating cream containing benzoyl peroxide. I decided on trying a box of sleepytime vanilla tea because that's what I recall [paradoxical sentiments] mentioning several times in her posts so I thought I'd start there. now I'm simply going to have to figure out how to prepare it and try some tonight. I'll throw it away if I don't like it. I know I would do that.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I did skip GIGs today and I didn't go to tech beautification day or participate in the chalking for don't underestimate either. sad. on the stupidly long bus ride back I glimpsed hannah and david and allison walking towards east campus. david did mention yesterday that he'd be covering the frat houses area of campus. I see pictures posted by hannah later on facebook.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>missing the grocery bus earlier led to me arriving for our cs3750 group meeting an hour later than proposed. they didn't seem too mad. they looked at me during small talk and cracked a joke making fun of mac users. I halfheartedly assured them that I'm not a complete mac-head. anyway I ended up doing absolutely nothing at the meeting besides installing a likely unnecessary plugin for eclipse. I don't know enough html or css to be able to cook anything up on my own. after a bit over an hour we agreed I'd simply look at what they had made and tweak it to complete what we need to do.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>an unsurprisingly disappointingly unproductive saturday. it's now 10:21 after over an hour of skimming through the movie rush hour 3. it's considerably more over the top than I remembered. I remember watching it at the theater with old middle school friends about five years ago. I thought the girl was cute.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at least this isn't sunday night.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I ordered a pizza from papa john's and ate the entire pie. I'm wondering how it all fits inside me. I blew $15 on it and the delivery guy looked a little intimidating but was polite.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>there are thoughts in my mind's queue I've been wanting to get at for a while and I should write them down in a notebook shouldn't I, before they're gone forever.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hopelessly unproductive. I'm unbelievable sometimes. there will be no source of comfort until the work is done, the fact that this is just fine and normal doesn't help because it sucks.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>oohh. my mind doesn't feel THAT dead. and I don't even have enough mental energy to crank words out like usual. nowhere near as fast. unless I literally babble out every thought I have in my head. talking sarcastically like GLaDOS would be kind of cool. sorry, I'm a nerd. I've never really done one of those writing exercises where you write down whatever you think without ever picking up your pen. or in my case, without every stopping my typing. I'm keeping an eye on the word counter now though. it goes up surprisingly fast usually when you concentrate more on the typing than the counter. there, I'm almost at 700 now. and now I just passed it. see?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I don't have time right now to slow down and think and bother to organize the thoughts I have in my head. if only everybody could slow down to think and express their thoughts orderly. without seeming like jerks in anyway. just our opinions. what we think of things why we think of them the way we do. the I-think-you-could-fall-in-love-with-anybody emotion would then grip me and I'd melt in it.</div>

; 3-1 fri
<div><br/></div><div>; around 1:40 pm</div><div><br/></div><div>i think i've officially hit rock-bottom. i honestly think i'm becoming depressed. i still feel like doing absolutely nothing during the day after classes. i've been eating less. my stomach can beg to be fed, but i'll either just not feel like eating anything, or be too lazy too. i don't write very often anymore. i go to bed a little bit earlier, because there's just nothing else to do. when i get back to my dorm, all i want to do is wait for Zoro to start playing L4D2 and join her for a couple hours, until she leaves. i wake up, put on literally the same shirt every single day until i wash it and switch to a different shirt, go to class, eat (maybe), and then dick around on the computer for the rest of the afternoon, evening, and night until i put myself to sleep. i'm at a record low, and..nobody knows.</div><div><br/></div><div>monique came over to watch the movie with me, and we just did that. she came, she left. i'm feeling silly again because of all the things i thought about beforehand, but i never once thought any of it would be within reach anyway. i kept thinking about kissing her. after i opened the door for her she immediately launched into an inpenetrable cloud of words, this is the right door, right, i remember the clockwork orange cover, wait which room is yours? we sat on my bed and i set my laptop on top of my printer and played the movie with the volume all the way up so i could hear it. my door was wide open and i wanted to close it but i was afraid of what she would think of it. we never touched or hugged. i kept swallowing during the movie, and sometimes i heard her too. i was wearing shorts. it wasn't warm. when she left, she just went out the door and walked away. i had little to say to her, even though i would have loved to say everything to her. now i'm sure i'm not a full-time friend to her anymore. i don't want to send her an iMessage, asking if maybe she wants to watch another movie with me? or maybe i could come and play my flute with you and your ukelele?</div><div><br/></div><div>i have not gone to ACF for the past 3 meetings. i don't really want to go today. i know i won't be missed. nobody cares. that's all there, simply. david asked me on wednesday if i would be going, and i couldn't say &quot;probably not.&quot; i just said maybe. which just means no, because it wasn't a yes. he remembered that i said i would exercise with him once i adjust my sleep schedule. and what does that even mean? i don't have any set time for exactly when i'll be set to join him. just sounds like another excuse. is another excuse.</div><div><br/></div><div>i do the same things so often, every day, that thinking about some of it is beginning to make me feel sick.</div><div><br/></div><div>i don't care anymore, do i?</div><div><br/></div><div>i have words planned for when (only certain people) ask me how &quot;i am.&quot; anxious, i've used, and now i'll want to say, starving, or one other word that i forgot for now. then they'll ask whether i mean literally for food, or something else, and of course to clarify i'll have to tell them human interaction, social activity. why don't you just do this, go there, then? just seeing almost anybody i know now makes me nervous. even monique. even sam. i become stiff. i can't empathize. the closest friends i currently have don't know what's going on with me. tom seems really happy. our friendship embers are barely alive. then as far as i can tell, nothing has really changed with v. i still can't see a single thing from his perspective. then the people here. the few of them, scattered.</div><div><br/></div><div>i don't have much energy of any sort, and nothing to channel it into. some things i could try again are reading books and reattempting my flute. perhaps playing it is something i find a little embarrassing. effeminate. i gotta have some creative outlet.</div><div><br/></div><div>then something like this happens: Anna Mazzolini likes your status (it's about going back to barcelona). slight jump. that shouldn't make me happy. i'm seeing patterns in my behavior. i wonder if the people i stop talking to ever notice that i stop talking to them, ever notice me.</div><div><br/></div><div>; 8:50 pm est</div><div><br/></div><div>jennifer (not ha, but anjaly's friend, and i'm still not entirely sure that that's her name) said hi to me in the CULC today as i reached the stairs, i hadn't noticed her. she seemed happy to see me. actually bothered talking. i wasn't expecting that so i had to turn around and take a step back. for a moment she actually seemed to understand what it was i had just been thinking about while writing the above. then some guilty thoughts.</div><div><br/></div><div>talking to my parents makes me sad. and depressed. i don't think i'm taking care of any of the responsibilities they think i am. i just don't care anymore. but am still worried. i'm just wasting their money and wasting my life. i'm afraid i'll become one of those stay-at-home, living-in-mother's-basement sons that are a subject of ridicule among young adults.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 3-4 mon</div><div><br/></div><div>But if you don't like it you're going to be miserable your whole life. You need to find something you like, even if you suck at it, and do it. Ideally it is something cs related but if its not then it is not. Idk how to find something you like to do, but maybe you can take some random classes next semester that look interesting to you</div><div><br/></div><div>I know :( I've been thinking about that a lot. too much thinking..what do you do?</div><div><br/></div><div>an hour and a half later he responds: I'm the same way at times. You have to stop thinking and start making changes. I am figuring out what I really want to do still and just focusing my all in it, and not in other cs classes that aren't relevant to my interests</div><div><br/></div><div>urvashi was on the grocery bus yesterday but i don't think i really learned anything from her. we talked about barcelona mostly. even she was opposed to the idea of returning to the small kebab place down the street. am i that scared?</div><div><br/></div><div>later that night i found that my laptop's built-in microphone does in fact work in dead space 3, and ended up playing and talking with a black guy who said he used to be in the military, and could clearly hear him talking to his &quot;faggot&quot; brother about how much sex he used to have.</div><div><br/></div><div>it's easy to picture steph asking, in a scolding manner, where have you been? i would say either uhh..my room? or where i've always been. both are true.</div><div><br/></div><div>who else? anyone who asks where i've been, i think, doesn't care.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 3-6 wed</div><div><br/></div><div>Zoro, she messages me now. today she did so while still in school, and told me that she doesn't talk there because of a &quot;speech problem&quot; that's not quite dyslexia, and that she's an outcast..it made me uncomfortable and i wanted to back away, again. i was the one who stopped responding. she's always been the one to start it. i think we're both tiring of L4D2. last night i dreamt about her for the first time, but she remained an online presence in the dream, i think. i wonder what she thinks when she sends me the first message of every conversation. her father died some time around when she was five, and she hated him. she's been telling me and a couple other of her steam friends, while we're in-game, about her brother hitting her on the head and how they got a 'PSA' on him (i still haven't figured out what that is). she seems part of a fucked up family to me.</div><div><br/></div><div>i had several encounters today in a short span of time; christina and allison were sitting in the student center commons, sheng called me by my full name, anjaly leaned a bit to be sure she saw me, suggesting we play, using the word like it's the only one there is for it. i made extra sure to sound easy and casual. sam and ritchie are at starbucks, and i'm with them.</div><div><br/></div><div>urvashi was excited for me, but i think the opportunity to revisit barcelona is gone. i've waited too long and booking a flight from anywhere to the city is impossible.</div><div><br/></div><div>one good thing, is that i have talked to tom, even if just a tiny bit, some times this week. i wonder if he wants anything for me, still. he can't be his high school self anymore. he found amy, so i'm sure he transcended that state long ago by now.</div><div><br/></div><div>so i may return to ACF this friday, and it'll be fun, thrilling, because it'll be new for just a while, and i'll hear what people have to say to me and i can pretend i'm loved.</div><div><br/></div><div>i guess there's nothing wrong with crying to a song.</div><div><br/></div><div>this caught my eye:</div><div><br/></div><div>does anyone ever realize how shitty life is</div><div>like….we have all these little things to keep us happy, video games, shows, alcohol, drugs, friends and family, whatever</div><div>but all of it is so fucking meaningless</div><div>it’s just there to make us forget how fucking shitty everything is</div><div>this world could be so much more beautiful than it is now, but everything is just a copy of a copy, and so are people, just fucking copies of copies</div><div>everyone just fucking works until they die, and that’s it, that’s what we’re fucking bred for and it’s fucking sickening</div><div>and the best part is no one really gives a shit</div><div>i mean yeah sometimes we think about it from time to time, but we’re too fucking mentally exhausted and numb that we don’t really care</div><div>how wonderful it is to exist, but look what we do with these existences,look at what life has become</div><div>just fucking copies of copies</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 3-11 mon</div><div><br/></div><div>i don't feel any freer, even after deleting the game. i skipped ACF for the fifth time in a row last friday, because i wanted to play it instead of going. returning will be difficult now. i have certainly become more estranged from them in the past month and a half than i had thought i was before then, than i had wished i could say i was. i keep wondering what they think, but chances are they don't think anything. only david, maybe, saw this coming. i think i will try harder to go to ACF this week, and i'm not expecting a welcome. i know i'll end up feeling less let down that way. it's surprising easy to pretend.</div><div><br/></div><div>my mom tells me to call and thank them, like they're nothing more than household guests, instead of my mother's parents. i think i'll ask her how her trip went.</div><div><br/></div><div>zoro still messages me and i still find it kind of funny. make sure to remain open to her, and don't care about whatever's going on with hylian.</div><div><br/></div><div>music hasn't tricked me. i tricked myself.</div><div><br/></div><div>i wallow in several different virtual media. seal myself in. plug my ears up. i've actually forgotten what's outside, and how bright it is just outside the front door.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 3-13 wed</div><div><br/></div><div>; 2:06 pm est</div><div><br/></div><div>well, i've forgotten another sequence of dreams.</div><div><br/></div><div>i suspect being away from people for more than a month has done something to me, because i found myself barely able to casually keep up with john dugan yesterday. i thought about how far away from here we were when we met, the things that were going through my mind at the time, the excitement then. we started talking while on a tram, and walked marie bradford back to her onix room.</div><div><br/></div><div>the one called billy spotted me and waved. it's amazing because i've never said a single word to him. then again i recognized him too.</div><div><br/></div><div>i wish i could say that my conversations with Zoro are getting more interesting, but i'll never bet anything on her. yesterday she talked about being &quot;horny&quot; and was surprised when i told her that i've never asked anyone out. she thought i was the kind of person who would have had &quot;a lot&quot; of girlfriends, she's so wrong.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 3-16 sat</div><div><br/></div><div>; 7:30 pm est</div><div><br/></div><div>i feel like a lot has happened in the past..two days. i can't believe i'm on another 8-hour flight bound overseas. it's over 10 months since i left for barcelona, and less than 8 since i came back. overall, i feel a little uncomfortable.</div><div><br/></div><div>zoro, now amanda, gave me her skype username, and as soon as our conversations transitioned to there from steam i started constantly saying &quot;oh no&quot; under my breath to myself, and i found myself wanting to talk to her now. based on what she's said to me, i've inferred that i'm most likely the only one of her steam friends that she talks to (aside from the mysterious &quot;hylian&quot; of course, and i'd like that. and now, i want that too. what am i getting myself into? she told me a lot about him seeming to be upset with her to the point of apparently ignoring her for hours on end...now that i'm leaving for london she said things like she'll have no one to talk to. and she offered to stay up late with me last night so i would have someone to talk to. nobody has talked to me like that since asta. strange…</div><div><br/></div><div>and i can't help wondering if she abruptly gave up her crush on hylian and shifted it over to me. what would i do if she asks to call or video call? maybe that will never happen.</div><div><br/></div><div>i talked a little with sam yesterday too. i ended up pretty much forgetting to go to ACF. i guess since monique said she wouldn't be there i cared a little bit less about it. the apartment was quiet yesterday. he ambled into my doorway to say good night and kind of gave me a hug while i sat with dead space 3 paused.</div><div><br/></div><div>earlier than all that, i encountered anjaly's roommate jennifer on the way to the post office and we actually had a decent conversation. it surprised me, that i was able to talk with her for several minutes, of all people. because that wouldn't have happened with anyone from ACF that i can think of.</div><div><br/></div><div>everyone who i've told about going to london has told me to take lots of pictures.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 3-25 mon</div><div><br/></div><div>i wonder: what do people REALLY think of you? does anyone talk about you? does anyone think about you? you've been consumed. and you know it, too. there are things HAPPENING out there. you're too afraid to reach out and talk. you'd rather be friends with what's hostile to you.</div><div>he may as well have been in a coma for a hundred years. that's what it felt like. he can't see anymore, his eyes, his real eyes, you know, have stopped working . in his head is a little core, where even his own dreams can't live. he's running out of room and keeps tearing at the walls but it makes him smaller. blurriness, water, tiredness, nausea, he's swimming in it all at once. i give up.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
; 3-29 fri</div><div><br/></div><div>are you about as happy now as you were when you were with them?</div><div><br/></div><div>tom always stops answering, and melissa just never fucking answers. i don't, i mean i just don't UNDERSTAND.</div><div><br/></div><div>today i went to ACF for the first time in what must be around 8 to 9 weeks. i was nervous, walking in. i felt my heart fluttering. it was like when you approach a group that someone you have a crush on is part of, only the someone was everyone. david said &quot;come here&quot; obligatorily when he saw me, hugged me, and told me that he sometimes does what i've been doing. i don't think he's a liar, but i don't believe him when he says things like that. he doesn't seem to be like me at all. maybe i can't mask it as well.</div><div><br/></div><div>enoch waved at me for 3 seconds during which i pretended to not notice until i stopped pretending and acknowledged him.</div><div><br/></div><div>i couldn't reply to anything steph said to me.</div><div><br/></div><div>ethan and lydia had a conversation while i sat behind them and listened.</div><div><br/></div><div>mike warned me, offhandedly. that made it clear. i've been drowning in waters that are so far beyond any of their boundaries that they scoff at the thought.</div><div><br/></div><div>monique asked me once or twice, in a soft, precarious voice, how i'm doing. i didn't recognize valerie until i overheard monique introducing her to someone. outside the room, we all touched each other's faces, as a gesture of &quot;love.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>one of the acts was a skit titled &quot;obsession.&quot; monique was in it. nick was in it. vince was in it. ritchie was in it. andrew was in it. i had seen it before.</div><div><br/></div><div>louisa isn't a terrible singer. she went up and conquered a fear.</div><div><br/></div><div>she announced at the end that they had raised $647, to which i had contributed 1.</div><div><br/></div><div>i went to london for spring break, i told several people. london?</div><div><br/></div><div>were you about as happy with them as you were when you weren't?</div><div><br/></div><div>3 years running, and still, they know something i don't, i thought as i listened to enoch talk. never been able to figure it out. maybe one day the barrier will break down and i'll find something unimaginably wonderful that will dissolve all of my problems. the barrier will break down...</div><div><br/></div><div>i still didn't want to eat out with them tonight, and steph's persuasion did no good. a little more time, then. i walked with jonathan pham back, and as we talked i became aware of the depressive waves emanating off from me. i must figure out a way to stop that. i thought acting happy was easy enough, that i couldn't tell how happy i was actually was then.</div><div><br/></div><div>i like when jennifer randomly walks up to me to say hi. too bad it never gets any further than that.</div></en-note>      ]]>

<div>
<div>last tuesday, nate introduced a new thing at the in-service. every week, someone will go to the front of the room and spend a few minutes talking about him/herself and his/her cultural background. because we aquatics staff make up a diverse group, he said. this was the first occurrence and nadia went to the front of the room to speak. she's from columbia. it seemed very out of place, her talking about her heritage and what the country is like. she said she doesn't know anything about drugs, i don't know if that was a joke about her country, but an audible &quot;wow&quot; went around the room when she said that she'd never been drunk before, because she doesn't like the taste of alcohol.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i didn't swim prior to ACF this friday, but still intentionally went late so i arrived at my customary ~7:30. seeing everybody, the ACF people, has begun to feel strange. i am no longer accustomed to seeing their faces and hearing their voices, being in their presence. louisa greeted me (she was laughing a lot for some reason) and as i sat down, i felt extremely ungodly and that i outright didn't belong there. i felt forbidden. attendance was low, again. i basically got there just as the discussion on the things was wrapping up, so i got nothing out of it. i like talking to louisa, but didn't get to say much to her. i rode in monique's car again on the way to dinner, and she seemed excited as always, but maybe it's just because she likes driving people in her car. i know i would be feeling the same way (same as perceived) if i were driving people in a car of my own. doing my best to refrain from all immediate judgments here. however, the way that she continuously quipped about her music, how big her car is, and her parking skills was very noticeable to me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>talking with christina always feels like a sort of accomplishment, a very lame one too, just by the nature of it. even if our conversation is mere lines long, i'll still feel a tiny bit of happiness at just knowing i'm able to say something to a normal person. that night, we talked about fried catfish and how it must taste. this was concerning my menu choice. i went with it, and the meal was amazing. halfway through dinner, i gave up even trying to socialize, between half the table talking about whatever the fuck basketball game was on tv and the other half talking about twitch plays pokemon. i had no interest in watching 'troll 2' with monique and andrew either. i wanted to go back to my room and pass out on my bed instead. i had gotten barely 2 hours of sleep the night before, and had consumed so much caffeine that i was trembling all afternoon until 6 pm. i'd had almost nothing to eat for around 10 hours and so was feeling sick. but nobody needed to know that.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>david has revealed that he still reads my tumblr blog, by commenting on a post i made on facebook that said the same thing as one i made on tumblr a while ago. his recent behavior has been very irritating to me. i don't know if he made that comment unwittingly or intentionally.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now this is interesting, i got into an argument with zora yesterday. it was over whether or not &quot;coke&quot; is the most popular colloquial term for &quot;soda&quot; in the southern united states. as she lives in pennsylvania, she calls it &quot;pop&quot; and insisted incessantly that that is the main term, and also that &quot;coke&quot; is in fact not the colloquial term for &quot;soda&quot; in the south. i got caught up slightly too far in the argument before i heeded my warning signs, and dropped it because zora is in no way worth the time to argue with, especially over a topic like this. maybe i'm just bitter, but i like her less now, even though she has been texting me quite a bit. i'll continue to reply to her but there will be no need to guard against investing emotional validation in her, as that would be a complete joke.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i have been obsessed with the microsoft surface because i have subconsciously forged a link between the product and the phantom emotional connection i felt with ashley last friday morning, an image that will be impossible to recreate under any circumstances other than my dreams.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the CUSA swim meet was last night, and i never have any clue what the schedule at the pool is, so it may be going on today too, but anyway, dan a. was the shift supervisor when i went yesterday, which mildly upset me because i don't like him that much. it was a college-level meet, so all the swimmers there were around my age this time, which made things more intense. the speed at which they swam was insane and the cheering was nearly mind-blowing. the guard kevin durkan was there, and i like him because of his easy-going nature. people like him are easy to approach and talk to, while people like dan a. and myself are not. when i dislike anybody, it is consistently because they exhibit some trait that i identify within myself as well, as undesirable. now i don't know if i'm completely off, but dan a. seems extremely emotionally immature to me (and so am i). he acts infantily flirtatious around the girls, and also makes random noises when he's in a fooling-around mood, that don't fit his uptight character. he is easily the least likable head guard/shift supervisor.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i almost left early because i thought my shift ended earlier than it actually did, but checked the times and realized that i'd be staying for closing after all. that's over 2 hours later than i was supposed to, but i didn't mind it at all. i was once again happy, almost content, to be cleaning up. before all the schools left, a group of swimmers came up to me and asked me if they would be allowed to all jump off the 10-meter platform, and i wished i could grant that to them, but someone else who wasn't even part of our staff said they wouldn't be allowed because of insurance issues.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>one of the very last things the announcer guy said during the meet wrap-up was a thank you to everyone involved in the event, including georgia tech aquatic staff. that's me!, i thought.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i don't know what the fuck the guard andrew hull thought he was doing, and he's far less likable than dan a. is. rarely does anyone give off such a fuck-off, you're-not-worth-my-time-talking-to vibe. when i rotated him, he always left almost before i even reached him, hardly ever looking at me. he also tried and did a poor job at bossing me around a little bit, perhaps thinking he could because he (thought he) knows more than i do about what to do. may or may not have sprayed me with a hose on purpose, ignored me when i yelled at him. maybe i just yelled too quietly. i don't know why the guard kaitlyn? talks to him so much, or (possibly) dates him. she radiates a similar, though less intense, vibe. i feel like a discarded object whenever they talk to me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in the guard office after everything was finished, they gossiped about austin milton and austin roberts. especially the shorter, fatter one, who seems to really enjoy talking about other people like this. kaitlyn? made a remark about getting laid. discussions about fraternities and going out to drink really depress me, because they really sharply remind me that i'm floating out very, very far away from the sun.</div>

<div>cheyenne's took place some time last week, during a closing shift at the competition pool. i was permitted to leave some 15-20 minutes early because all the cleanup was finished and there was nothing left to do. when i asked what she and the other non-regular guards would be doing, she simply shrugged and said they'd be &quot;hanging out&quot; and i thought 'no thank you' but it almost seemed like she knew it was something i'd have no interest in sticking around for.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>anjaly appeared last night, as i was emptying my mind at the CULC. she was on her way to meet up with some people or whatever, as usual. i pretended to not notice her at first, but she walked up to me. i gave her a bad hug, and we had a short, conversation that was mundane until she suggested that we get lunch, and my ears perked at that. she said she would text me. we'll see.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>jennifer (that's her friend) showed up a minute later and peeked at my writing before realizing it was personal. when i told her i sometimes post to tumblr she asked me to follow hers. i don't know if i followed the right one, because it's a very run-of-the-mill looking one and she hasn't followed me back, which shouldn't make sense. i'm sure i got the URL right.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>tonight's small group was a little something. the group size was a record 3 people, just monique, jasmine, and myself. monique looked cute today. i say this casually. something about her, maybe the lighting. i remembered last week's topic when she asked me to recall, indicating that i had thought about it earlier. and the topic tonight? recognizing life as a struggle, an always-ongoing journey that can never end while one is still on this earth. that and not remaining anchored to the past. monique once again (and she recognizes this in herself) spoke before she thought and said a lot about herself, and only now in this tiny group did i take the small amount of time and appreciate her and the fact that her perspective on her own life is more out of reach than anything else in the known universe. if the point-of-view gun was real, there would be no need for any words. some more on the brokenness in this world. some more on the meaninglessness of life. some more on the distance, the waves, and the struggle. and finally, the devil at last! he appears in her story too, and i know him now, the sly, sneaky little shit, and the tools he employed to play me. think about the prize, is it not worth infinitely more than these pathetic clouds of smoke i've been fooled into thinking are real? monique asked me what my own struggles are and have been in my life, and i realized that here is an opportunity! and i nearly let it pass, but was able to hold on for just long enough and squeaked out in my dull voice some more about how the city wrecked me like a child, how i adapted all too well, the relationships i burned down, and what i did to drift away from God. the closest thing i had to a drinking problem, and the same loneliness monique and i shared at different points in time at different places on the earth. i know absolutely nothing in this world. the heaviest things that have happened to us occurred while we were so young, back in eras long since buried. now keep in mind, the memories that i'll be looking back on in as early as a year from today are being formed at this very moment. they'll all be fond; the only regret will be that i'll wish i had more. more colors, more music. there is pressure now. no matter what happens, it will all be over soon, very soon. and that is not a reassuring thought. it is very hard and very cold.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i have declared that i'm on my way back to god now, back into god's arms. it's too late to reconnect to the majority of ACF, but i think i caught my latest glimpse of god very recently.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>monique and i currently have plans to go out to a pub on friday afternoon. last week i was just longing to go out for some normal activity, and ideally it would be at night but were these prayers, though not even voiced, answered right now? i hope that this time will be...fruitful. oh dear god.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i should ask ritchie out to lunch, if just once. in return.</div>
<div><br/></div>

mar 9 n</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<div>the story continues</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>friday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this was the day i endured the series of three interviews. to every single person who asked me afterwards how they went, i replied, &quot;better than my past interviews, but i don't think/i'm not sure it was good enough.&quot; there was one person there, who arrived at the same time as i did, who was very soft-spoken and reserved, and spoke extremely quietly. it was written all over him. i saw it in his body language while we were eating lunch, the way he sat and the way he held his and hands. it repulsed me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the interviewer danielle was the one who took me from the lobby to the room upstairs where the other people were waiting. this was just like epic. she looked a lot more mousey that i remembered. her hair was different and she wore glasses. at the table, she made me and the quiet person state where we are from and a fun fact about ourselves. i used lifeguarding, and don't remember what the other person said about himself. when i said out loud that i work as a lifeguard, one of the girls said a soft &quot;really?&quot; i later found out that she goes to tech too.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>because i was unaware of their stupid program extending into the afternoon, monique had to wait. after i got back to campus, i kept my shirt and tie on. monique took us to an area in &quot;decatur,&quot; to a pub called the brick store. i knew i couldn't be excited for the wrong reasons, but i was still happy to be there. i ordered the same thing she did, a hefeweizen, which took me back to jordan. and we fell into the same pattern again, where she talks and i listen, only i'm becoming less and less sure about the listening. this time, monique detailed to me the dates she went on with her korean boy (and let me remind you that she no longer talks to him really) and i'm going to keep it as simple to me as possible. she talked, i listened. we drank. i had a rather decent buzz going by the time i finished the pint. she also talked to me about her parents' marriage, and touched on her father's death several times. i wondered, for a while, if monique was only sharing these things with me because she had some alcohol in her, but that couldn't be, because she had to drive and would know to check herself. for much of it was some personal stuff. who else has had the privilege of hearing these things? i don't know for how much of the time i looked at her, or she at me. on the way back, i picked kraftwerk songs. i believe that i was a little less locked, but was also reminded of how infantile i still am.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now because we returned less than an hour before ACF began, i was on time/early for the first time in approximately one and a half years. so many people commented on my being dressed up and &quot;snazzy&quot; it was unbelievable. i sat through a worship also for the first time in approximately one and half years. i don't really remember what clement talked about at all, just that when he tried to get people to stand up to accept jesus and whatnot, no one did (i saw no one standing when i peeked). i was in an okay mood that night, but didn't socially erupt and simply spent the rest of the hangout acting absurdly stupid until i couldn't tolerate my own behavior anymore, and left.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this brings us to saturday, when i had lunch with ritchie. i met with him at the ULC courtyard, watching him as he walked over and up to me, alone, specifically to eat a meal with me. our silences weren't awkward, at least to me, but they were long. i was thinking not about what else i could be doing, but what else he could be doing. i'm still not used to people setting aside their time just for me, and i'm always worried that they don't really want to and are only carrying through with it because they're bound. this in turn makes me anxious and afraid to ask again. i'm even a little afraid of approaching my only open stream with this question.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>while we were waiting for our food, a guy walked in and said to the waitress who seated him, &quot;it's just me.&quot; and ritchie and i agreed that it seemed very sad.</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>

mar 31 m</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<div>there is barely over one month remaining, and i'm ready to give up at this point. i'm almost willing to nuke the remaining grounds, sever all of these ties and try to force myself to start all over. it would be an immensely slow process, with no guarantee of success, and i have no way of knowing what i'll be able to achieve in the future. i'd like to label the final sortie as a second renaissance, but i'm too apathetic. apathetic. that was the keyword in one of monique's latest blog posts, and one that made it directly relevant to me. i feel how i choose to feel. there shouldn't be any more to it, but i've still been waiting for a phantom thing this entire time. i haven't outsmarted the illusion. i thought i had.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>small group did not happen for me tonight. monique's telltale imessage was a harbinger of only slight disappointment. i could have kept swimming. i finished watching 'twin peaks' this weekend (actually last friday). i watched 'oldboy' today. your last few tumblr posts are pretty inspirational! i should look into livemocha, i want to learn french or german. none of these lines were spoken and probably never will be. the girl guard with the long curly hair and who kind of looks like annasophia robb i've never talked to and probably never will. she's just someone else.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i still need to write asta a letter, and i've decided that it doesn't have to be long. and it'll have to be about us, what's left to say of it. will i be apologizing? thanking? i'm very little compared to her now. i hope it's because she's entered world one already, while i remain here.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the real reason why i haven't been in a relationship with anybody is because i'm simply not ready. i know that i wouldn't know how to deal with a person. i'm nervous. the second reason why there has been no second renaissance is the influx of black holes that have begun cropping up again recently. just as i'm beginning to learn how to live as a family of one. some nights i'll struggle to stay above waves, more rarely i'll almost cry. the densest concentration of matter still lies here.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i saw david today, to return his sleeping bag to him. i couldn't ask him to unfollow me on tumblr. he may be the sole reason why i will create a new blog. was he ever important? yes, he must have been. at some time in the past, but i don't want some people here now. but then again, do i have the luxury of choosing this? maintaining a friendship is tiring. i don't want to do it sometimes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i have nobody to talk to, and it's entirely my fault. this has been stated multiple times, many many times, but i want to hammer in the fact that it's entirely my fault. and i don't believe i have any more time to fix it. have we lost our way?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i rarely turn my attention to this now, but i easily spend about 95% of my time alone. basically the only times that i spend with other humans are monday nights, friday evenings, and any lifeguard-related hours. classes are excluded, and only the 5 or so ACF-related hours have any chance of being fruitful, and if any energy is expended in that timeframe, it's all directed nearly exclusively to a single soul. one who has not been reciprocating the same type of energy, ultimately resulting in loss of energy, self-esteem, optimism, and confidence. this is loneliness even without any of that social media bullshit. what a complete fool i have been to believe that i was EVER at the top of ANYBODY's list.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>somehow, every song on switchfoot's newest album 'fading west' invokes ghost memories of ACF. actually, perhaps the recall that is invoked is not phantom...simply mythical. one day we will all pass into myth. the second sortie, the first renaissance that was believed to have taken place, when in fact it was anguish, a variety of such flavors, that grew during the springs of old.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i don't know where to find comfort anymore. all the streams have run dry. and i'm STILL not ready to cry out. despite all of this, i'm still not as sad as i used to be. hence, the apathy? the worst emotion. the absence of emotion. i've been afflicted with this, i realize now, for a long time. i hope i never was stupid enough to consider it a strength.</div>

<en-note style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">
3-4 t
<div><br/></div><div>Yesterday, Lisa appeared just beyond the bottom steps. She didn't stop walking. I don't [think] God even heard my &quot;hi.&quot; She said, &quot;Have a good day.&quot; I said nothing to her, I was so taken aback. Maybe she had a bad morning. It was raining.</div><div><br/></div><div>This bottle labeled &quot;optimism&quot; is still relatively new. And now, I'll probably never get the opportunity to dissect it. It's extremely fragile and thrives only in the presence/absence of specific people. The ones who dissolve it include Katie, Cheyenne, Nica, nearly any of the girls, and the ones like M-Rob. There are those who promote it, too, of course...in some time from now, I will probably completely forget that I ever struggled with this emotion, this having faded away on its own like a wound slowly healing incompletely.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
3-14 t</div><div><br/></div><div>The things that happened today that instigated some kind of emotion:</div><div><br/></div><div>Me, sitting in the CULC, endlessly <u>ruminating</u>. This needs to stop, needs to be converted into action.</div><div><br/></div><div>Me, deciding to sit outside to get some sun.</div><div><br/></div><div>Vince and Jon Pang appeared. They were reading Isaiah and asked me to join. I went to them, but was not interested. Dongjae appeared, and he had a lot to say. I remained <u>silent</u>. I realized that any other person would have actively participated in the conversation.</div><div><br/></div><div>Anjaly must have gotten a new phone number, and I never realized until today, when I tried to text. Don't take this personally, I reminded myself.</div><div><br/></div><div>Lisa always wants to stop to talk with me. We appeared to each other on the stairs, again. She wore a red dress. I couldn't simply walk ppast her, she turned her head at me and we talked for a while. <u>That's just the way she is.</u></div><div><u><br/></u></div><div>Asta can only provide blind support. Don't rely on her for self-fulfillment. It will not be found there.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
3-12 w</div><div><br/></div><div>I tried to text Monique but couldn't: I want to avoid Asta, too. But that is self-destructive behavior, and we're putting to a stop to it, remember.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
3-23 n</div><div><br/></div><div>Jessie and I do have a quite a bit in common, I assume.</div><div><br/></div><div>D.F.W.'S 'This Is Water&quot; is, I think, our latest gold mine for thought.</div><div><br/></div><div>I need to draft a letter for Asta.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>3-25 t</div><div><br/></div><div>It seems the number of prayers that are being answered is increasing. Remember to be grateful and of course do not take it for granted. I'll be cimplicitly thanking God tonight.</div><div><br/></div><div>It was Monique who prayed for me yesterday. I didn't understand Jennifer M.'s sporadic behavior, but I'm sure she's just being young, is all.</div><div><br/></div><div>I almost really, really like her, but there's just too much light to be seen.</div><div><br/></div><div>Nica greeted me but talked more with the other guards, which is something I would do as well. I kept staring at her as she fell asleep while Nate was talking.</div><div><br/></div><div>A man asked me for help getting a subway card, and I didn't help him even though I could've handed over my empty card.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
3-26 w</div><div><br/></div><div>Every chance at positivity is stifled by disappointment. I have homework again. Today I ran into Yan by the food trucks outside the CoC. We interacted briefly. I think both of us were a little uncomfortable. Am in desperate need of practice.</div><div><br/></div><div>Had an encounter with a stupid stranger in the hallway today. Originally was not going to write about this because I felt that she didn't deserve a spot in here, but I need to grow and that's more important.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
3-27 r</div><div><br/></div><div>Felt a little bit saddened and disenhearted today. Don't know where I went wrong. I stayed inside all day watching Twin Peaks while Monique went to a tea house to study. Several people responded to her invitation to join. I want to quit the social network forever. Only went outside for my 2200 demo and LP shift. A bunch of cool people were all working at the pool at once. Tess ignored me. I told a group of girls that weren't allowed to take the figure-8 floaty in through the current channel. Felt lonely. The supreme optimism didn't show up today. Said not a word to Cheyenne, nary a word to any of the others. A black day.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
3-30 n</div><div><br/></div><div>The problem on Friday was that I failed to maintain a positive attitude. I'm afraid it might have showed. I didn't interface with M at all, and doing so with Steph feels stupid. I get the &quot;why do I bother&quot; when I talk with her.</div><div><br/></div><div>I need to radiate more positive energy.</div><div><br/></div><div>Almost didn't sit through the board game, but maybe it was for the better. I should [have] learned something. On the way back, I caught the feeling of not wanting to expend effort into a friendship in its tracks.</div><div><br/></div><div>Interesting things on Sat: Cheyenne could be more assertive too. She and I had a small talk convo that SHE gave up on first. Despite working with Nica, I said nary a word to her. She liked the kids. I thought about &quot;the time is now&quot; but couldn't act on it. Finally, seeing/glimpsing Maggie J. ached my heart for a bit.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div><b>3-6 n</b></div><div><br/></div><div>on friday christian took me to a gnc. him being as quiet as he is, i didn&apos;t quite catch him saying that he&apos;d be going there instead of the gym. i actually did guess that that would be the case, but i wasn&apos;t sure enough and i didn&apos;t bother confirming. it&apos;s becoming annoying when he says something so quietly that i can&apos;t hear him when i&apos;m just a few feet away. i&apos;d like to stop saying hm? what? and just ignore him when that happens. and also need to concentrate on being louder myself. i&apos;m fairly certain that i&apos;m not nearly as loud as i think i am.</div><div><br/></div><div>why would he take me to the gnc anyway? why not tell me he&apos;s going to work out and go by himself. i don&apos;t understand.</div><div><br/></div><div>i started playing a new game with &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE, rainbow six siege, the closest to a modern multiplayer fps game i&apos;ve played in a while. we only play cooperatively against computer controlled enemies in a game that definitely has multiplayer modes. what&apos;s the point? i know i can&apos;t be judgmental. there&apos;s too much i don&apos;t know and haven&apos;t much business knowing...his friend, who i now call chang as well, is married.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>3-10 r</b></div><div><br/></div><div>after desperately seeking someone to tell about &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE not knowing about disneyland, and finally settled on christian after deciding there was no reason to share this with alice. not that there was much more with christian. we both agreed it was fucked up that &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE didn&apos;t know disneyland is a real place. christian&apos;s comment that he needs to get out more was only fuel for my judgements.</div><div><br/></div><div>I made a pointless and fruitless return trip to the container store. the place almost has a phantom-nostalgic vibe about it. how new it looks, how it almost feels quaint. but that, and I, are as empty as all the different boxes inside. this time the store was packed, and very Loud with all the people inside attending some kind of event. there were people standing by the escalator holding trays of glasses of wine. I turned down an offer for chardonnay. what the fuck?</div><div><br/></div><div>I almost feel bad because I get frustrated most easily during shoulder workouts, and I always let it show. I think I could mask it if I wanted to, but I let it show. I wonder how it affected christian, or if I just a big ego and think he cares about the situation when he really doesn&apos;t. I know I would feel awkward if he were next to me and clearly angry. I wouldn&apos;t know how to deal with it. too many inhibitors, I wouldn&apos;t say anything, I wouldn&apos;t let myself do anything natural.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>3-21 m</b></div><div><br/></div><div>my mother frequently mentions my getting married in the future, when I haven&apos;t even been on a single date (except the one time with Kat).</div><div><br/></div><div>over the past several weeks my routine has evolved ever so slightly; it once again incorporates L4D2, which I now play nearly exclusively with DOOGIE, and which is now almost a requirement for a week-night to feel complete. I can&apos;t continue to spend my time doing this.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>3-22 t</b></div><div><br/></div><div>looks like the alice march phase lasted for only a few days. I guess orgasms clear my head.</div><div><br/></div><div>I wanted to get an olive green shirt because the color reminds me of dani and her olive green pants she was wearing the last time I saw her at chipotle.</div><div><br/></div><div>the anxiety sets in as I&apos;m merely thinking about moving to a new apartment in a month or two. one that I&apos;ll be owning myself. with help from mom and dad, of course, but the fact is this is kind of a landmark thing and I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m getting into. this will be anchoring me here for years for sure.</div><div><br/></div><div>the upcoming discomfort. the insane resistance to even the smallest changes. how odd. I&apos;ll be feeling lonely again.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>3-23 w</b></div><div><br/></div><div>I can never seem to avoid wasting the day away, every day.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>3-24 r</b></div><div><br/></div><div>there is one week remaining &apos;til the end of march, and I can&apos;t remember a single thing.</div><div><br/></div><div>christian and I didn&apos;t workout out yesterday, so my new socks were mostly spared from my gym shoes. I had still put them on though, because he waited until we had already left the building to tell me that we could either go to the gym or get something to eat. probably because he had some kind of meeting to attend; I don&apos;t know, I couldn&apos;t hear him. we went to yeah! burger. he seemed to avoid looking at me, although he does make eye contact when he&apos;s talking to me. the loud ambiance made it even more difficult to hear him. I&apos;m tired of not being able to hear what he&apos;s saying, or not knowing what he&apos;s talking about because he&apos;ll say something vague about a topic I never realized he transitioned to, despite trying to listen. the day before he was saying that gay marriage legalization is, relatively, not a big civil rights leap forward, and it took me moments to realize he was comparing it to the abolition of slavery.</div><div><br/></div><div>but I also know that, as he&apos;s the person I actually spend the most time in person now, my own voice has become softer and softer again. I&apos;d be more comfortable being louder if he were louder.</div><div><br/></div><div>careful not to blame this on him.</div><div><br/></div><div>according to him, he and mark are still in touch and mark has been working long hours at his new job. making much money of course, and that always leads to the but-no-more-time side of it. he used to make about the same salary as me I believe...is married and has two kids...what kind of life is he living at 31/32? christian always laughs when talking about him. is he happy about it?</div><div><br/></div><div>I wonder if the woman at the security desk gets tired of saying good morning.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div>3-1 w</div><div><br/></div><div>so it&apos;s now been a week since my jury duty experience, I saw mike again last weekend, and it&apos;s been five years since I first began keeping a journal of any kind.</div><div><br/></div><div>I was only there for two days and I was among the few loners left as everyone else began making friends with each other. I started feeling attached to whomever I was near at the moment, but talked to pretty much no one. it was the first time in years that I found myself exposed for a prolonged time (think hours) to a new group of strangers. I couldn&apos;t help but note how much older than me most of them were. last strands of youth. and married, all of them married and discussing husbands and wives. scary. marty gave me a friendly reception when he saw me again at the end of last week. I guess it just depends on his mood.</div><div><br/></div><div>I saw mike again last weekend. a year.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;d proposed la fonda again but switched it to flip burger, so so far I&apos;ve gone there three times with three different people. I wasn&apos;t sure how to greet him. we didn&apos;t talk about anything interesting and I didn&apos;t have anything new to say about myself since last time, other than that I&apos;d moved. some talk about what we do for work. I applied to grad school. no girlfriend. don&apos;t go out much, at all, never. he said he only goes out to get groceries. think it&apos;s true? he extended something of an invitation for me to come to his church group again. said some people from the past go there now too. I don&apos;t think I will. not because I&apos;m afraid of them, I&apos;m sure. just that there&apos;s no point. and I don&apos;t like that stuff anymore.<br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
3-6 m</div><div><br/></div><div>maladaptive daydreaming, ADD, OCD, depression, depersonalization/derealization?</div><div><br/></div><div>I need to stop buying fast food coffee in the mornings. it makes my insides too jittery.</div><div><br/></div><div>I need to incorporate exercise other than lifting weights. weightlifting on its own is useless. being fit is different from just being strong.</div><div><br/></div><div>I can now begin rereading my past journal entries now that it&apos;s been five years, except that the earliest ones, from 2012, are ones I&apos;ve already reread a few times in the past, just because they were at the very beginning. I expect to find some interesting things I&apos;ve written somewhere in the middle.</div><div><br/></div><div>the time and apathy are unreal.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>3-12 n</div><div><br/></div><div>when I look behind me I&apos;m drowning in a sea of memories that don&apos;t feel like mine.</div><div><br/></div><div>it wasn&apos;t god that I believed in five years ago.</div><div><br/></div><div>last night I reached 2,000 hours in L4D2. wonder when the 1,000 mark was.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>3-19 n</div><div><br/></div><div>sometime earlier this month I reached 2,000 hours in l4d2. I think I mentioned this already but I don&apos;t remember when.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;ve been relapsing into the game recently. coming home and finding no other way to efficiently kill the time I have left every day.</div><div><br/></div><div>my mother is coming to visit for a week in a few days. I&apos;d like to begin making a concentrated effort to appreciate her presence at every opportunity I get. I need to remember that she won&apos;t be around forever, and when she goes, I&apos;m going to miss these days intensely.</div><div><br/></div><div>I was a huge loser this weekend, ordering two pizzas for myself specifically so that I&apos;d have enough food to last the weekend without having to go out.</div><div><br/></div><div>the timeline of my products is getting ridiculous. I first bought a pair of outlier slim dungarees nearly a year ago, last may/june sometime, and I only recently settled on a final order last month. throwing money away on returns and selling things I thought I&apos;d want to keep. it&apos;s funny to think that alice cost me over $150, that I lost when selling the saint laurent sneakers (am aware of the flawed thought process). meanwhile she&apos;s long forgotten about me again. then there&apos;s all the time spent repacking things and stopping by the UPS store or the post office. all the paper and ink used to print return labels. all the tape used to affix them. is insane. I&apos;ve gone through multiple ink cartridges and tens of dollars of tape by now.</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s difficult and feels quite new, but I&apos;m just now realizing that I can potentially realign my feelings to no longer rely nearly completely on outside objects to just feel okay.</div><div><br/></div><div>the maladaptive daydreaming is still snowballing.</div><div><br/></div><div>just over two years ago, I first ran into DOOGIE.</div><div><br/></div><div>my fast food breakfast habit has not died whatsoever, if anything it&apos;s become even stronger, and I&apos;ve been feeling my stress briefly spike in the mornings because I perceive the Jessica to be judging me every time I walk in holding a mcdonald&apos;s bag.</div><div><br/></div><div>uncertain of where I stand with Bina currently. nothing&apos;s been happening and I haven&apos;t taken any steps either.</div><div><br/></div><div>time is accelerating as quickly as it is because I do the same nothings every day and week. with no memories to fill in the gaps, the timeline collapses.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>3-24 f</div><div><br/></div><div>mom arrived on wednesday and will be staying until tuesday. her presence is pleasant, but was initially jarring. I really had no idea (forgotten) how heavily dependent my habits are on solitude. having to put much of my normal routine on hold feels really disruptive. as is all the extra stuff everywhere. honestly it kind of put a damper on any hopes I had of ever living with another person again.</div><div><br/></div><div>as soon as she climbed in the car with me I noticed how my voice falls flat as it always does when talking with virtually anybody. I can recall how it sounds to others from recordings of myself I&apos;ve heard. it&apos;s awful. I don&apos;t feel confident.</div><div><br/></div><div>even though all I ever do on my own is remain planted in front of the screen, having my mom with me makes me suddenly feel like I have nothing to do. I stand around and loiter aimlessly in my own home. I feel lethargic and stressful. she&apos;s been immensely helpful and busy for me, doing much of the cooking and cleaning. this has made me realize that if I ever have to go back to living with my parents, I&apos;d be completely and hopelessly screwed. I sometimes imagine that version of my future. letting myself go to that extent, subsisting on junk food, failed ambitions, constant mental strain imagining a better life.</div><div><br/></div><div>the apartment is the cleanest it&apos;s been in a while. I just mean dust free. much of the surfaces and floors are clear again. but because it can&apos;t last without significant time spent on upkeep, it just adds more stress.</div><div><br/></div><div>I simply can&apos;t imagine being old. that concept just hasn&apos;t entered my mind yet. I&apos;m always wary, but some things can only be learned with enough time. I keep thinking I&apos;ll die unexpectedly early.</div><div><br/></div><div>the weather is heating up and soon I&apos;ll need to reach for the a/c again. it will only be the second time I&apos;ll use the a/c in this apartment. and the last time it will feel new.</div><div><br/></div><div>approaching one year since moving in here, and the end of the third cycle. it&apos;s right around here that I expect I&apos;ll start to lose track of the beginning forever.</div><div><br/></div><div>my mom and I were having a discussion last night that included charles and he doesn&apos;t seem to be making much money. I commented out loud about how my latest order from outlier cost $500. just to say something for myself to hear, to make myself feel a little superior.</div><div><br/></div><div>for months and months on end, I&apos;ve been stewing in isolation, turning away from any possibility of socialization, a seemingly never ending influx of products my only driving force. it&apos;s now finally reached a relative calm, and a small and simple thought is circulating in my mind, what if I just stop buying things? instead of obsessively exchanging for the &quot;perfect color&quot; I can just...stop adding. to the complication while my things are still simple enough. I feel the fear that surfaces when I look past all of these new clothes.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>3-25 s</div><div><br/></div><div>finally spending a day doing other than my usual nothing makes it feel longer again. even if all I did was go grocery shopping with my mom at h-mart and eat lunch at a korean tofu house. it felt productive.</div><div><br/></div><div>at the h-mart I ran into blair. it&apos;s nice that I didn&apos;t automatically pretend not to see him. I wonder how I seemed in his eyes. he took a picture of me, which I didn&apos;t object to even though I felt uncomfortable because I didn&apos;t know how to make myself look good. here&apos;s just another reminder to always look my best when I go outside. he sent it to mike, david, steph, and monique. only mike I felt okay with since I just saw him recently. the rest, I&apos;d almost rather they had just continued to forget I existed.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div>3-3 s</div><div><br/></div><div>today&apos;s new events (I tend to delay transcription because I fear being unable to accurately convey my thoughts and feelings)</div><div><br/></div><div>other than cody and co., I&apos;ve seen a couple other semi-recurring characters at the running meetup events, but no matter how attractive they may be, I always end up sticking to cody and/or whoever else I&apos;m already comfortable with. that was pretty much the case today too. I recognized the Hannah, the girl who looks like lillian, and who I hadn&apos;t seen since last december. maybe I was just lucky that she still grabbed a seat near us. towards the end of the jason&apos;s deli socialization, for which the Dorothy and David were absent, she invited us remainders (me, cody, Jay, and that Kayla?) to her jiu-jitsu class at noon. I recalled her mentioning this class last year too. as usual I felt the resistance but also recognized the opportunity this time. so I went. the others backed out.</div><div><br/></div><div>we walked together to her apartment building in midtown. it was a really nice building. I followed her through the lobby and into the elevator. she had bought her with her ex and now owns it herself after they broke up, she said. I asked her how much it was and it was 350k. I wouldn&apos;t have guessed she was this loaded. the inside looked like a showroom, I said. like something out of a magazine. I had to remind myself that all of this belonged to her. it was intimidating. I wasn&apos;t being entirely truthful with myself as I spoke, as my core reactions were still significantly suppressed. also this was yet another time I was invited into someone&apos;s personal space like it was nothing. she has animals.</div><div><br/></div><div>we met up with one of friends, a black guy named James, who I&apos;m sure if I&apos;ve seen prior to today. and we ubered together to the location, a boxing gym which turned out to be fairly close to where I live. the discomfort of standing in a foreign environment was almost...becoming familiar? her class that the James and I were guests to ended up being a very small, intimate group of just three other people. another girl called Mallory, who looks like one of the crc employees I&apos;ve seen. a Jacob, the instructor, who seemed cool. and a Jose, who I didn&apos;t talk to. I probably already forgot all the moves I was taught today. Hannah seemed pretty grateful towards us for coming with her. we joined their crew for lunch too, at jalisco no less, which I had haphazardly recommended. there I learned a little more about the Mallory and how she functions.</div><div><br/></div><div>returning to the Hannah&apos;s place, where she had no problem leaving me alone while she went to let the dogs out. I was actually left alone with the two dogs several times, and I was never energetic with them, nor did I talk to them. the Mallory and Jacob briefly joined our hangout. while Hannah took a shower, Jacob took a quick nap and Mallory held the animals and scrolled through memes on instagram. somehow I only noticed her as the one who never really looked at me. she seemingly forgot to say anything to me when she and Jacob got up to leave, though I didn&apos;t think anything of it until she pointed it out herself, when Jacob shook my hand. as I&apos;m somewhat genuinely interested in the class, maybe I&apos;ll see them again?</div><div><br/></div><div>then the Hannah was getting herself ready for a date or something at the mercedes-benz stadium with a guy she mentioned she was seeing (so there goes that), so I left too. I didn&apos;t like how perpetually frozen I was. she gave me a hug before we parted. I used one arm.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">3-4 n</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">when in the presence of others, the fantasies lose their shine and the fetishes lose their luster. but as soon as I&apos;m alone again, they reconstruct themselves frighteningly quickly.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">I was watching my thoughts yesterday and still caught myself imaging a romantic and/or intimate scenario multiple times. some things still haven&apos;t changed. being preoccupied with such a stage as a goal is affecting any chance of it happening naturally. I don&apos;t think anything significant is going to happen between me and any of them on its own. why is that? because I wasn&apos;t interesting or memorable enough? I can&apos;t be myself. I have no self to be.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">now that I know where Hannah lives, I&apos;m aware of every time I drive past her building.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">there&apos;s no reason for her to be thinking of me at all. I messaged her today and she seemed okay with me. I&apos;m not grasping for signs anymore. I don&apos;t want to.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">I leaked some of my thoughts to cody and he responded frivolously. is it something with me, that attracts that kind of behavior?</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">let the record show that I &quot;relapsed&quot; twice today, breaking a 153-day streak. the excuses don&apos;t matter. I do feel terrible and they were both among the least fulfilling orgasms I&apos;ve ever had. it almost felt like a dream afterward. like I gave up a lot for something that wasn&apos;t even worth the few seconds it lasted.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">the internet has been down at my apartment for three days now, and I&apos;ve still managed to resist being productive. having so much less distraction to turn to is newly painful. when there&apos;s nothing to run to to dull the pain, I&apos;m left with no choice but to fully immerse myself in my situation. I&apos;d like to stop the retail therapy too. and let the discomfort resurface, so I can rediscover what I&apos;ve been hiding from. and start doing a better job at tackling it.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">I tried messaging monique again, but she sadly simply doesn&apos;t seem interested in reconnecting.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">an issue with isolation: when I begin viewing a person as a target, it eliminates any chance of having a natural, organic relationship with them, romantic or not. I&apos;m trying (I need to) push those thoughts away.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">3-11 n</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">saturday:</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">do I want to join the jiu-jitsu class to actually learn something, or do I want to just because Hannah is there? I think I&apos;m trying to convince myself that the latter is not the case. I&apos;m not convinced.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">I didn&apos;t see anyone I recognized in the group other than the David and Jay. David seems slightly childish, almost. as we all began running, he sprinted up a steep hill instead, as though to show off. then switched directions at some point, I encountered him twice running the opposite way.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">I didn&apos;t see cody until I got to jason&apos;s deli, well behind everyone else. he texted me asking if I was here. Hannah wasn&apos;t there and cody never answered the group message she included us in. Barb showed up later, not dressed in running wear because she had sprained her wrist doing something. she smiled at me once. they started discussing the camping trip that I hadn&apos;t heard anything about since two weeks ago, and for some reason they assumed that I would be going. even though I hadn&apos;t been included in the group message the rest of them had been participating in. in fact I had assumed that I was simply excluded. now I still think I might go, and I&apos;m hoping I won&apos;t end up in over my head.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">I messaged Hannah about the bjj, and as I waited for her to come down to her building lobby I felt anxious even though I&apos;m not in love. I ended up driving her to the gym, which I entered for the second time. it was still foreign and uncomfortable. the instructor, Jacob, recalled me. he taught me a move that I practiced on Hannah. she demonstrated it on me too, and I could smell her. I couldn&apos;t help thinking about how this was the closest I&apos;ve physically been to a girl, and felt my mind gearing up.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">there were several other people this time who weren&apos;t present last week. one of them was a smaller, short guy and he reminded me of mark. at the end I watched them &quot;roll&quot; and Jacob asked me if I would get a gi. the answer is not obvious yet.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">I went to lunch with some of them again at a restaurant right next to the papa john&apos;s I&apos;ve gone to many times now. they kept referencing people I don&apos;t know.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">I drove her back to her apartment and she invited me in again. I wasn&apos;t sure if I was expecting to be back there in a week. her animals kept running up to me again and I didn&apos;t talk to any of them. I didn&apos;t know what to do as she did various chores. her place is organized and well-decorated. she told me about her succulents again, apparently having forgotten that she already told me about them last week.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">then we took the dogs outside and walked them for a bit. it was my first time walking a dog. I didn&apos;t realize how many people had dogs.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">we parted for the day when I drove her to the midtown marta station so she could join her parents for a pre-birthday dinner. her birthday is march 11, the same as Chloe Price&apos;s.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">later that night I met up with cody, Jay, and Barb for dinner at fellini&apos;s pizza, where I hadn&apos;t been since some time when I was still at tech. Barb arrived a little late and I said &quot;welcome&quot; to her. I was wearing the alexander mcqueen jacket, as this was the kind of scenario that I&apos;d always envisioned as an opportunity to put it on. but despite cody telling me it didn&apos;t look too flashy when I asked for his opinion on it, I still felt uncomfortable wearing it and it might have shown. I&apos;m sure Barb still perceives me differently. the way I expect others to see me, as someone who isn&apos;t as fully socially developed as the average person. the jacket would have just made that worse, even though she complimented it too. I responded notably hesitantly.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">~</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">today:</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">as much as I try to convince myself that I&apos;ve made progress, I still felt the familiar anxiety as I drove myself to eclipse di luna for Hannah&apos;s birthday lunch. I contemplated wearing something to stand out again, but decided to tone it down, which is good because nobody would have seen it positively, I don&apos;t think. I recognized krista patel the moment I opened the door. she said, &quot;I know you&quot; and I was glad to have a little something to say to one of the people there. one of them said that Hannah likes to &quot;collect people.&quot; which I actually had figured. I know by now that her wanting to spend time with me isn&apos;t for me, but isn&apos;t malevolent either.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">the rest of the time sent me into a downward spiral because I didn&apos;t know anyone else there (one of them was someone I sort of knew from lifeguarding at the crc, but he didn&apos;t see me, didn&apos;t remember me, or ignored me) and I just lost any drive I had to try socializing. the guy sitting next to krista kept rubbing her back, so maybe they were together. the guy sitting to my right was oddly proportioned, I thought. one of the others, a Matt, had a funny laugh and seemed pretty lively but I was sitting too far away from them when they had a conversation about prostates, which I thought could have been an opportunity to say something funny and relax myself. that never happened. I never said anything to Hannah which is okay because I have realistic expectations now. I guess the person she came with, a John, is her boyfriend or the guy she&apos;s seeing, because I saw her kiss his neck once. I don&apos;t know why that hurt slightly to watch, because I&apos;d already heard her mention that she was seeing someone, and also I didn&apos;t detect any significant attachment to her from myself, nor have I been grasping for signs.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">at the end, Hannah and some others wanted to do karaoke at the John&apos;s place, which was barely across the street from the restaurant. maybe it was a mistake refusing the discomfort again. but there was no way in hell that that was happening. she messaged me asking if I&apos;d come, as I was driving away. I never said happy birthday to her and didn&apos;t say a proper good-bye.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">in short, I wasn&apos;t able to loosen up and was too keenly aware once again of the loneliness and unimportance, that clouded the whole time. I drove myself home and spent the rest of the day wallowing in the all too familiar pain. the food was mediocre at best. I wonder if Hannah had sex with him today.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">I wasted a good amount of time in galcon 2 and encountered &apos;petunia&apos; once again. they asked me how old I am (apparently forgetting that they had already asked). I mentioned the birthday lunch for Hannah and they asked me if she was gf material (I said she was seeing someone) and then if I had ever been in a relationship. almost as if they knew I wanted to talk about it. they told me already that they were 48, but this time added that they&apos;re gay and had a hard time with it in church. but described themselves as &quot;a little slut!&quot; so I don&apos;t really know if they&apos;re a man or woman. the last time we chatted, I learned that they&apos;re in atlanta too. they were a little encouraging but left the game before talking much further.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">paying attention to the urges. I don&apos;t feel any urge to masturbate. I&apos;m still resisting getting the $750 sweater, although that might break soon.</span></div><div><br style="font-family: Segoe UI;"/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">3-15 r</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">I had been having delusions of grandeur about driving several of the running companions to the campgrounds, including Cody, Barb, and maybe Jay. but Barb relayed that she&apos;ll be going with that Charlie from a couple weeks ago, so I guess they&apos;re hitting it off. somehow, this still hurts even though I had nothing with her.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">yesterday I suggested to Hannah that I might join her jiu-jitsu class, and I still don&apos;t know if that&apos;s a good idea. I wonder how Cody will react to it if I tell him. what he&apos;ll guess my motivations are. maybe I&apos;m still not being with myself about them, either. it feels reckless.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">I could</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">possibly</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">still drive up there with Cody tomorrow, we&apos;ll see. and then from there we&apos;ll see how this camping trip goes.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">3-17 s</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">The struggle continues. Frustrating how I seem to have nothing to say about another novel experience.</span></div><div><br style="font-family: Segoe UI;"/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">Cody driving over with his camping equipment. Driving up i-75 n while the sun set. Stopping at a KFC, the first one I&apos;ve been to in years. Shopping for food at a Kroger. Turning off the dashboard backlight and driving into the evening on the deserted country roads. Discussing how simultaneously peaceful and creepy it felt. Opening the sunroof and catching glimpses of the stars running with us through the trees.</span></div><div><br style="font-family: Segoe UI;"/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">It was past</span> <span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">11 pm</span> <span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">when we reached the campground. David was there with his friend, a Hem, and so were Barb and Charlie. They were the only other ones there. It felt intimate pitching the tent in the darkness, the only sources of light being the fire, a few headlamps, and my phone. Cody did most of the extra setup with the tarp and sleeping bags. I said to Cody that there was no way Barb and Charlie weren&apos;t getting cozy with each other, but he thought that they were just being friends. They walked over from their separate campground, and we all drank some beers while standing around a lantern on the grill rather than around the fire. I had three cans and was somewhat drunk. We parted</span> <span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">at around 2 am</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">. I drunkenly asked Cody if I should make a tinder profile and he said I should try it. Of course he was probably a little drunk too.</span></div><div><br style="font-family: Segoe UI;"/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">Earlier that day, the Andrew resigned from his position at touchpeak. He had only been there for about a month longer than I have.</span></div><div><br style="font-family: Segoe UI;"/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">This morning I woke up to the sound of rain loudly pounding on the tarp. I was reasonably comfortable in the sleeping bag Cody brought for me, and didn&apos;t feel particularly cold. There were some flashes of lightning and crashes of thunder as I stepped outside into the rain. It was about</span> <span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">8:30 am</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">.</span></div><div><br style="font-family: Segoe UI;"/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">We used the matches I brought! to start a new fire. Barb and Charlie came back over. Cody tended to it for a bit as we sat and stood around it, changing positions as the wind blew the smoke in different directions. Eventually we got around to heating up the jalapeño cheddar hot dogs Cody and I bought yesterday. I ate four out of the twelve. I took over Hem&apos;s bluetooth speaker and played the twin peaks soundtrack followed by of monsters and men. Hem and David seemed to enjoy it a lot, which validated me.</span></div><div><br style="font-family: Segoe UI;"/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">We had a brief mini adventure in which four of us picked up Barb&apos;s and Charlie&apos;s assembled tent and carried it to the campground next to us after the people who were there left.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">Throughout the day it became apparent that Barb and Charlie were getting closer together (in case the fact that they came together weren&apos;t enough); he put his hand on her thigh and kept putting his arms around her from behind as she sat on a pile of firewood.</span></div><div><br style="font-family: Segoe UI;"/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">Hem and David went on a short hike. Barb and Charlie</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">&nbsp;are off together in their massive tent after Barb set up her hammock next to the rest of us.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">And Cody and I went on a brief walk of our own, during which he opened up to me a little more about his ex and how he&apos;s having a hard time moving on from her after seeing her posting on social media.</span></div><div><br style="font-family: Segoe UI;"/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">Several others from our group were supposed to arrived earlier today, including the Dorothy and Jay, but as of</span> <span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">3 pm</span> <span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">they&apos;re still not here. What&apos;s the point of &quot;camping&quot; if you&apos;re going to be here for such a brief time? I&apos;m going to like it better without them because we&apos;re already an established group in my mind, and adding additional people will just minimize me even more.</span></div><div><br style="font-family: Segoe UI;"/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">Seeing Barb and Charlie makes me slightly sad, not because I want Barb, but because this would have made for such a nice experience to share with someone to grow close to. And it&apos;s not happening, and still not happening, and I&apos;m uncertain if it ever will.</span></div><div><br style="font-family: Segoe UI;"/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">I like the campsite better at night. It feels somewhat cozier with the walls of darkness surrounding you. In the daylight, everything feels wide empty and open.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">3-18 n</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">Dorothy and the others trickled in in the late afternoon, and the campground quickly became more crowded as they brought all their equipment and food to the table and began setting up their tents. Dorothy and Heather, who I last saw at the hot pot night, arrived in Dorothy&apos;s suv, and Jay and his boyfriend Ian arrived in another. after that, Ben and Ai-Ping (who I had also first seen at the hot pot night) came too.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">it was around this time that David got around to cooking his steaks for us, and this eventually led to an incident that left shockwaves to be felt even throughout the next day. but first, most of us left for a 4-mile hike. the main group comprised me, Cody, Dorothy, Heather, Jay, and Ian. Cody and I were a little hesitant initially. I probably only decided to go because he did. we stopped at a couple scenic spots overlooking the gorge, and I decided to bring up my phone&apos;s portrait mode photography, which everyone (especially Dorothy) was unexpectedly excited about when I showed some of them earlier. deep down I just thought that maybe I could get someone to take a cool-looking shot of me and I could use it on tinder. Dorothy wanted several shots of her, and after I took a couple with her in the center of the frame, Cody suggested that I move her toward the left or right third. it did look better that way.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">Dorothy jokingly suggested he pose with a unique-looking branch he had found earlier and was using as a walking stick, flexing his arm with his sleeve rolled up. I took the shot, and everyone found it hilarious. I was feeling a little jealous of the attention he was getting, but knew better than to attempt to reorient it vainly on me. I also didn&apos;t like the shots of myself, because I&apos;m not used to seeing myself in pictures still. it&apos;s startling to realize that this is how every other person sees me.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">throughout the hike, we birthed several inside jokes. one was about the pleasure tent, later renamed to the pleasure palace, referring to Barb&apos;s and Charlie&apos;s tent because Dorothy heard noises coming from inside when she and Heather initially parked at their campground. she said they sounded like a raccoon. we gossiped a lot about them and wondered aloud how Barb and Charlie grew so close so quickly when they only first met a few weeks ago.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">they, particularly Dorothy and Cody, all also made fun of Ben a lot, and I jumped on that train because I&apos;ve been looking down on him too. apparently Ben&apos;s passiveness is off-putting. he kind of just showed up with no tent of his own, expecting to piggyback from someone, but without ever explicitly asking anybody. Dorothy had brought an extra tent, but said straight up and she didn&apos;t want to share it with Ben.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">all the while I wondered if they ever talk about me when I&apos;m not with them. pay attention and learn to recognize what qualities of mine people pick up on. they&apos;re never as oblivious as they often let on.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">we returned to the campground, feet aching, and I took a few photos of everyone preparing food. the incident mentioned earlier occurred around now, when Charlie approached the site and found his cast-iron skillet, which had been used to cook the steaks, unwashed. he was clearly upset about it and his complaints, expressed awkwardly through his formal-sounding language, produced some tension. I didn&apos;t want to look at him. David spoke up and said he would take responsibility for it, in a manner that I think reduced the tension. Charlie was practically monitoring his pan getting washed, warning not to put it into the tub of soapy water. he then saw that Cody had squeezed some dish soap into the pan, and said, &quot;shit. please remove that immediately.&quot;</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">we cooked dinner as the day began to darken. Dorothy&apos;s marinated beef ribs, some vegetables, David&apos;s second steak. potatoes we attempted to bake by wrapping them in foil and placing them in the fire. cracked open a beer. Dorothy brought huge marshmallows that I couldn&apos;t finish a single one of. Charlie &quot;taught&quot; Dorothy a little more chinese and I chimed in some. I drank throughout the evening with the intention of becoming significantly intoxicated, eventually bringing the kraken rum back into play. I hadn&apos;t been this drunk in years. I kept saying the same things. that it had been years. that I wouldn&apos;t remember most of the night. looking around the darkness and trying to focus on the lights we had hanging around the campsite. I talked mostly with Dorothy, Jay, and Ian, I think. I remember Jay saying he likes drunk me. after Cody showed us several pictures of himself he had taken that highlighted his body. he spoke to us again about his feelings towards his ex. while the conversation was still focused on relationships, I fired into the void and said a line &quot;is that how it goes?&quot; in response to something someone said (something about how long the early phases of a relationship should be), and I heard Dorothy ask me about the longest relationship I&apos;ve ever had. here was the chance I&apos;d been wanting all this time. but I didn&apos;t spill all of it, just that high school was basically the only time I&apos;d had one. they said it was too long ago to count and that they had to find me love. I said something about tinder again.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">throughout the night I must have wandered off a little ways four or five times to pee in the woods. Ai-Ping had several friends arrive late at night, around 10. I mistook one of them for Cody in my drunkenness.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">Barb and Charlie broke off fairly early, and after I guess Ai-Ping and co. left too, we remainders (me, Cody, Dorothy, maybe David, Heather and Jay?) gathered around the fire and began talking about Charlie and his outburst about his pan earlier in the day. we all agreed that none of us liked his vibe. I mentioned at least twice how strange it felt every time he put his arms around Barb. Dorothy and we decided he wasn&apos;t welcome in the group anymore.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">the air was chilly this morning and as expected I woke up realizing I couldn&apos;t remember much of last night. we seemed to somehow all wake up more or less at the same time. Barb strolled over and I saw David pull her aside to talk to her. I knew what it was about! and he then updated me and Cody on the subject. I think Barb was within earshot of that though.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">because Dorothy didn&apos;t want Ben sleeping in her tent, Ben was forced into the back of David&apos;s car. she proclaimed that she became scared of sleeping alone so she slept with Heather instead. in fact Dorothy&apos;s tent remained empty all night. Ben said he couldn&apos;t really sleep at all because the surface was too hard. sounds like a miserable night.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">breakfast was cooked and had, and from there we slowly disassembled our tents and packed everything back up. I didn&apos;t feel any sense of melancholy when I gazed at the empty campsite. I guess the stay was too short for a good-bye. and I didn&apos;t feel too much about all the people, even though I do like most of them.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">Cody was a little hung over and our car ride was mostly silent. I became a little afraid that I&apos;m too difficult to talk to because I have so little to say and feel like I take too long to respond to things. maybe he would have had a better time riding with someone else who talks more animatedly, like Dorothy.. we stopped at a zaxby&apos;s on the way back, where we continued gossip about Charlie and Ben. I learned some new information about the latter. while I&apos;m kind of glad that I&apos;m in enough for conversations about other people, I&apos;m also not sure exactly how weary I should be.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">3-20 t</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">for some reason I&apos;ve had this strange affliction keeping me from letting go of pairs of meundies, wherein I envision myself with a girl who sees me wearing them and likes the design herself. it doesn&apos;t make any sense.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">3-22 r</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">nita and I are having one our little talks today, and she reminded me of one thing I need to always keep in mind: to be aware that people always think/feel/know more than they let on. today isn&apos;t the first time I told her that I have no relationship experience, but this time she decided to be honest with me and said that it was a huge red flag for her (this coming after I acknowledged myself that it&apos;s a red flag). and it hurt. but I&apos;ll think it was necessary. lately she had been another target for my tendency to grasp at others&apos; flaws when I&apos;m not feeling so hot about myself. maybe she doesn&apos;t deserve that.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">3-24 s</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">the week:</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">I bought a bjj gi on amazon on wednesday and told Hannah about it. she was excited that I was joining the class, but nothing more than that. I&apos;m still not sure why I joined. I&apos;m using fake reasons to try to convince</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">myself</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">. it felt reckless. like I&apos;m not sure if this change is one I actually want. but it&apos;s too late to back out now.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">&quot;you teach others how to treat you.&quot; that&apos;s something I learned a long time ago, but people are still learning to treat me the same way as always before.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">it feels devastating to have thought I&apos;d been making some progress all this time, only to find that I never actually even left square one.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">every time I start thinking I can finally get better, something happens that completely collapses the faith I had built up in myself. would anyone be happy to see this?</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">it started on saturday morning. at jason&apos;s deli with Cody, I met another John, who was new to atlanta. earlier I had been running just ahead of the John and someone else in the group. I could hear their discussion they were having, and I just decided that I kind of didn&apos;t like them, for no reason. so when the John sat down next to me and Cody, I perceived him as an outsider, a potential threat, unwelcome. as if I myself earned any more welcome. Cody took the initiative talking to him as I recognized myself automatically taking the backseat. the John mentioned that he went on a date the night before. suddenly, I had nothing. rather, the illusion that I did have anything in the first place became too obvious to continue to ignore.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">I recognized the Mallory&apos;s car parked outside the boxing gym. I went inside carrying my new gi in my arms and talking to the hispanic-looking front desk person to sign up. I dropped $230 for this. when I bumped into the Mallory she just smiled at me. present in the class this time was a bigger guy named Phil I think, who was also somewhat new and quiet. it made me assume that he didn&apos;t like me for whatever reason. Hannah asked if I wanted to stay for lunch again and I agreed, but when the Phil and Jacob left separately it ended up just being me, her, and the Mallory. and I let myself get dragged along with them instead of making an excuse.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">the two of them talked to each other as though I weren&apos;t even there. Mallory especially made me defenses flare up again. I tried acting like I didn&apos;t care instead of trying to say anything to her. avoiding eye contact with her because she never looked at me. everything fake. Hannah had bought a motorcycle for $4,000 and rides with her guy friend. she and Mallory were dissecting a text discussion between she and him. possibly something about the status of their relationship. I guess they didn&apos;t care that I was right next to them overhearing. it just further reinforced the wall between us, reinforcing my exclusion. I&apos;m starting to think that they knew and they wanted it. careful with these thoughts. maybe the Mallory does indeed not like me for reasons similar to what Cody said about Dorothy not liking Ben. they can tell how weak I feel inside. there was unspoken communication occurring the whole time. I lost my appetite.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">Cody never followed up with me about the movie-watching I proposed, but he did end up inviting me to his friend&apos;s apartment. I ended up staying with them until nearly 1 am and just felt more and more terrible as the night progressed and culminated in my abrupt, unannounced exit.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">there were a whole bunch of people at the apartment, which is in the same complex as the one david lived in when I visited after initially moving down here nearly four years ago. cast members included: Cody himself; a B (sp?), fratty-looking asian guy who is the one Cody describes as being perpetually high; a Ted, who Cody explains as having known since 5; I think the one whose apartment it was is Ryan; I think the girl Olivia is dating him; a Nate, similar in stature to the Ryan. as I walked with them to a nearby Kroger I got to see Cody behaving more naturally around his lifelong friends than he does with me. and also that most of them were probably smoking earlier and high already.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">the Ryan was plainly dressed in a hoodie and I probably wouldn&apos;t have thought much about him if the Olivia weren&apos;t here. actually the same goes for them all. as I sat among them by the grills outside, they talked about their past experiences and memories that they shared. previous relationships. I thought about the differences between the way guys talk about it and the way girls do. a second group of people, including a short guy who seemed charismatic and well-dressed, a chubby guy named Jose who was dating the pretty quiet girl in the floral jacket and who offered me his vape pen or whatever, and the Olivia came and went. I was anxious while they were there because I became aware of how I was too afraid to take advantage of the opportunity to talk to new people. once they left, I calmed down because that option was no longer available.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">I ate five hot dogs. at one point the Olivia looked at me smiled. I now know that that is</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">not</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">a good sign.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">I never introduced myself to the girl in the floral jacket. she was probably slightly shy too and maybe she thought I didn&apos;t like her because I was pretending to not care or notice. when I learned that the Jose (chubby) was dating her, my first thought was: how? she stood out because of how well-dressed she was.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">I never felt the high hit me like a wave like I did during the previous times I smoked with alice. but I was a little high while we were all gathered on a rooftop patio. people kept coming and leaving, and I talked to no one except for a few exchanges with the Ted. I felt increasingly awful as it got colder and later. at one point a whole string of girls showed up, all of them the type to remind me of the parts of life I&apos;m missing out on because I&apos;m afraid of it all. I think they were all friends of the short, well-dressed guy. instead of searching for ways in which I can tell myself I&apos;m better than them, ask instead what I can learn from them.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">I finally told Cody that I felt like leaving, and then simply stood up and walked out without saying anything to anybody. I wandered the long hallways alone, following exit signs, and managed to find the parking garage. I felt extremely anxious as I fell asleep, alone again.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">3-26 m</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">I cried myself to sleep last night and woke up this morning not remembering what I had been feeling. I have actually been starting to open up to my mother about these feelings. sending little cries for help. and then shutting down when she picks up.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">all throughout yesterday, I was utterly consumed by some of the worst anxiety I can ever recall feeling. eventually I became desperate enough to reply to my mother&apos;s text I had ignored, indicating that I wasn&apos;t feeling well. she and my dad tried contacting me but I didn&apos;t answer. I ended up agreeing to a skype call with my mom, during which I wasn&apos;t able to bring myself to describe my feelings in detail. so I&apos;ve just left them hanging, wondering what could have happened.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">I thought about talking to nita about it, but I didn&apos;t until today. I told her about my uncertainty towards the jiu-jitsu class and how I ended up feeling later that night. she seemed almost distraught that I hadn&apos;t called or talked to her earlier and kept asking me if I&apos;m okay. I never directly answered that question. she eventually began guiding me through a kind of meditation.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">~</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">I was worried I&apos;d continue feeling down all day today, but I felt better by the time I found myself in the boxing gym again for another jiu-jitsu class. Hannah and I practiced some stuff on each so we ended up on top of each other again. this shouldn&apos;t be so notable to me. I couldn&apos;t help thinking about what it&apos;d be like to be in that position with someone I&apos;m having sex with. I got to roll with her too, which was actually kind of fun even though I didn&apos;t know what I was doing. she still being relatively new herself, was probably easier and kinder with me than the others probably would be.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;;">I don&apos;t feel horrible anymore like I did throughout all of yesterday, but I&apos;m still unwilling to talk to my parents about anything. it doesn&apos;t feel like I&apos;m healing, but rather that it&apos;s just being buried. lying dormant. part of me doesn&apos;t want to get any better. every time I start feeling okay, I still become afraid. like I belong down here.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">3-28 w</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>Cody clearly doesn&apos;t want to have anything to do with my problems. I decided to try telling him a little bit, but he never responded. that&apos;s fine.</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s very different from the way nita responded to me though, which was full of concern. I decided to follow up with her about it yesterday, after our first conversation on monday. and she wanted to guide me through more of her meditations, though to be honest much of it was a little off-putting. the things she asked me to visualize didn&apos;t feel natural to me, and attempting them felt awkward. maybe it&apos;ll become more comfortable if I made a greater effort to try. we proceeded to have a conversation in which I brought the idea of &quot;when you zoom out far enough, nothing matters&quot; and she seemed excited that I recognized that. she called our discussion &quot;talking meditation.&quot; but misunderstood when I brought up a different thought, the fact that &quot;nothing lasts.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>today:</div><div><br/></div><div>there was yet another new person at the bjj class, a girl named I have no idea how to spell it, so I&apos;m just going to write Teress. she was a beginner too, practicing the same basics that I was. and slightly meek, like me. she also smelled very different from everyone else, and acknowledged her own b.o. I talked with her a bit here and there, normally.</div><div><br/></div><div>after the class finished, the Steven/Stephan and I had a brief chat lasting a few lines. I learned from him that Hannah, although she bought a motorcycle (and helmet/clothing), doesn&apos;t even have a driver&apos;s license. strange decision. Hannah herself seems to have been in a bad mood lately. the Steven/Stephan made a comment to her about her bike, and she didn&apos;t really respond as she left wordlessly. I&apos;ve been comparing my life to hers in my mind. maybe something&apos;s going on with her after all. I want it to be her relationship with whoever it is. but I&apos;m more concerned about her than I should be.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">3-29 r</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>I was again telling nita about my tendency to hold to memories of the past because I guess I just like reminiscing. while I doubt she fully understood the nature of what I was trying to describe, I had no answer when she asked me why I do this. I&apos;m aware that it won&apos;t last as the years go by. I&apos;m kind of just trying to hold on to the different ways I felt and experienced things in the past.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;ve been having a thought that the Mallory, and possibly others, think of me with a kind of disdain because my passive nature is probably instantly recognizable. the exact same way I look down on people who I perceive that way. for some reason I&apos;m kind of at peace with this? like I feel no need to force immediate change in myself to &quot;appease&quot; anybody, and kind of trust that I&apos;ll be likable enough whenever I&apos;m able to come crawling out of my shell again.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">3-30 f</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>the galcon player &apos;petunia&apos; has been greeting me &quot;hey bf&quot; whenever I join her (?) game. I&apos;m pretty sure it&apos;s a she. and I know she&apos;s 48, so I don&apos;t know how someone that age thinks. I actually confided in her a little bit the other day about my anxiety attack and being alone.</div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday ROdNEY messaged me on steam, and he mentioned seeing the picture I posted a couple weeks ago that was taken on the camping trip. he told me I&apos;m good looking and that I should share more pictures. that made me feel a little bit better. then he reminded me again that I&apos;m not getting any younger and should focus on loving myself.</div><div><br/></div><div>Hannah seemed perfectly alright yesterday. she talked to me a little bit more and the things that stood out to me were her mentioning that she sometimes gets in to work as late as 1 pm and doesn&apos;t think she does as much work as she&apos;s supposed to. I know exactly why I liked hearing this, and part of me doesn&apos;t want it to be true. because that would make it too easy to imagine myself climbing on top. but if it weren&apos;t true, that would mean she was lying. after the class, she and Jacob continued talking about motorcycle riding. I still don&apos;t get why she went and bought a $4,000 bike when she doesn&apos;t know how to ride one.</div><div><br/></div><div>today I let myself get dragged out to another one of beer hangouts with the rest of the company. this time we went to meehan&apos;s in atlantic station, where I had been one time before with a meetup group I don&apos;t remember. I was with them for about five hours. there was a large chessboard on the ground with two pairs of people playing against each other in the middle of a game. it was black&apos;s turn, and Aaron and I saw an opportunity for them to check and mate in the next move, and somehow no one else did.</div><div><br/></div><div>it was windy and kept getting colder as the sun set. the wind blew the big umbrella right up out of our table, and I didn&apos;t see it because I was hunched over taking a bite out of a chicken wing. until suddenly I heard everyone freak out as it landed on the table, knocking a glass of beer exactly onto my crotch, and also hitting Danny in the head. I didn&apos;t really react much, but it was unbelievable how perfect the placement was. I now have beer stains on my hoodie. some got on my shoes too, so I was glad I wasn&apos;t wearing any of my newer shoes.</div><div><br/></div><div>I still have no interest in getting drunk around them, so for most of the time I just sat and listened to the rest of them banter. Danny didn&apos;t have any alcohol to drink. they give Aaron a lot of shit for cracking bad jokes, but he just takes it. Richard and Anthony are particularly rough. some of the others, Kyle, RJ, Danny, and Aaron himself, are a little softer. Anthony&apos;s friend James still doesn&apos;t pay any attention to me at all, which is fine, I don&apos;t care. but I learned today that he lives in china too. also that Danny has a girlfriend and RJ has a daughter.</div><div><br/></div><div>after some drinks, they began to have some earnest discussions that stood out to me. Anthony was really frank with Aaron about his weight, and that if he wanted to actually lose any he would need to make strict changes to his habits and diet. it wasn&apos;t in a derogatory manner but an honest tone. Aaron agreed with all that they said. the subject of standing desks came up again. apparently almost everyone else wants one too, but Anthony has been unwilling to buy more? and only got one for me because of my &quot;ghetto&quot; setup I made that showed how &quot;dedicated&quot; I was. they struck a deal; Anthony would buy them all standing desks if they could get Aaron to lose 50 pounds in 90 days. I&apos;m not sure exactly how drunk they all were. would this actually lead to a change in Aaron&apos;s life, or will they all forget about it next week?</div><div><br/></div><div>at 8 I&apos;d had enough of the cold so I got up to leave after saying bye only to Danny, until Anthony stopped me as I walked around them outside the gate. I then stopped and had a discussion with him about me. it was almost like a lecture, but I perceived good intentions behind it so that&apos;s what I&apos;m going to roll with. it&apos;s a little embarrassing to admit, but it was once again an eye-opener to realize that other people do notice the way I behave and draw certain conclusions from it. oftentimes, I want nothing to do with the rest of them, and somehow I always forget that my air gets received. Anthony told me about how important it is to know how to interact with people. something I always knew he knows, and that I know I don&apos;t know. he told me that he wants me to be more sociable with the rest of them. I couldn&apos;t disagree with that. yet I felt the instant resistance as he began suggesting I go to lunch with. and also that he wants me to come along to karaoke eventually. that would be a true milestone. this is probably the most honest with me he&apos;s ever been, and I feel stupid for not keeping in mind that other people actually think something about me.</div><div><br/></div><div>I texted mike about having lunch again, after having forgotten about it earlier at the beginning of the year.</div><div><br/></div><div>hannah messaged me today, it was just a tiny thing but it still feels nice to know anyone thought of me for even a second.</div><div><br/></div><div>DOOGIE texted me tonight too, after some weeks without much contact. he posted to facebook that he&apos;d be deleting his account in wake of the recent scandal.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><b>3-31 s</b></div></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>this morning Tia showed up running around the park, with her friend who turned out to be her roommate who had just moved here from korea. and I just watched Cody talk to her while I listened. Tia said something positive about my running, so I remember that. the Kayla from several weeks ago was here too. she sat next to me but didn&apos;t talk to anyone and said a quick bye before she left. maybe she felt left out. Tia said something about having another party at her place, inviting me and Cody to go. Cody reminded me again of what I said last time when I didn&apos;t go to that sushi night, something like &quot;why do I always make the wrong decision,&quot; so I said that I should go to this one. he told me he&apos;d let me know if he heard anything from her, but said almost nothing until he already went over there, sending me the address. by then I was already in a sour mood, it was at least 10 pm, and I definitely was not in the mood to drive to a foreign place by myself to dive into another group of new people. I wonder what I missed out on this time. Cody&apos;s putting the minimal amount of effort, I feel, in including me in these things, and while I understand that I&apos;m not his responsibility, I&apos;m getting frustrated with how unreliable he is and how long he takes to respond to messages when I&apos;m obviously expecting something.</div><div><br/></div><div>I need to focus on not letting little things affect me too much. I rolled with Hannah and Mallory (for the first time) in class today. my confidence is still very low and I always feel the need to say something when I don&apos;t know what to do.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<hr/>
05-05; saturday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>days won't stop rolling into each other. it's been four since I last wrote. my momentum fades quickly. being away from school, which feels more like home than anywhere else right now even though I don't want it to, is having its usual routine-disrupting effects on me. it's a good thing I didn't have to endure a prolonged stay at my friend's house. I don't know how much of a mess I would have degenerated into in that space of time. staying at home is making a mess of me once again. days seem shorter and time travels faster still. maybe it's because of all the hours past midnight that I spend awake, hours belonging to neither this day nor the next.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it's 1:30 now and I'm awake to write and cross items off of the lists I have made on the Clear app on my iphone. I've become semi-obsessed, I've noticed, with my lists. why do the stupidest things always consume me? I keep looking at the lists and thinking about things to add and delete and can't wait to cross off all the things I add just as eagerly.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>what follows may be disconnected but they're on my list so I'm addressing them all systematically before the thoughts die completely in my head.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I felt an extreme out-of-touch during worship at grace midtown last sunday. I didn't see jane. it was just me and ritchie walking together this time. I'd thought ritchie was one of those people who I always can't stop smiling around, but our walk was quiet and conversations weak. I think when I anticipate weak conversation, I opt to not initiate it at all rather than struggle through it. I don't remember what the message was about. I remember a video about baptism. sentiments from joywok vaguely flicker through my mind, uninvolved, detached, could-have-been sentiments. I can barely get myself to sing during the worship, despite actually knowing two of the songs this time. I think to myself again about worship music and how meaningless most of it seems to me. is it because I still don't know God and all that? that I still think religious people are crazy and that I have no clue what all these worship songs are truly about.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my eyelids flutter and I forget who I am again.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>when it's over ritchie and I are the first people to leave the building.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>religion</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I walk with hannah, her boyfriend, and sam to the midnight breakfast. I'm excitedly showing sam space invaders infinity gene on my iphone. being truly the type of &quot;techie&quot; people here are always talking about and genuinely being unaware of it until sam hands my phone back to me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hannah mentions an email sent out to all the new ACF leaders. I never got that email and am not surprised since enoch's short talk with me. which hannah also brings up, mentioning helen because enoch had had the same short talk with helen. and kudo. people who, along with myself, I couldn't envision as leaders following in the steps of those like diana and steph. I smell make-up whenever I look at helen. almost infantile. a deer struggling, stumbling as it's still learning to walk. some guy awkwardly piloting a big robotic suit of armor. heavy masking, forced artificiality. fake fake fake. you don't know who you are and what you are is just ridiculous.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>david will be a small group leader. I feel the tiniest inkling of I've been a loyal ACF member for two years, he joins us for a few months and is already promoted to small group leader? for now I still have little trouble separating david from my bitter feelings I'm leeching from almost everybody else I know here. I feel a twinge of not jealousy, borderline betrayal, when he friendly-ly puts his arm around tam briefly, as a simple gesture of non-awkward friendship.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>melissa, the eccentric one. steph and cynthia have their own annoyances, but I saw a little something in their interactions with her, continuing to hope that I didn't generate it from my own sick mind. the wednesday night we all met her. steph and cynthia practically skipping together arm-in-arm (they probably really were arm-in-arm). but the way they switch to such a noticeably different modality when they answer her questions. they become straightforward, direct, constricted nonsense levels, stupid jokes. instantly. I'm trying to convince myself I can handle strangeness like it's home territory. I'm strange after all aren't I? no..I don't know if I'm fit either. but seeing how obviously unfit they were too..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I swear jimmy gets quieter every time I see him. I don't remember the last time I saw him or many years ago it was, but I never get the chance to analyze the way I see him. one of our oldest family friends. he's three years older than me and as he wanders into the kitchen I try to recognize just who he is, a college student, he's studying for some ridiculous test, he has a girlfriend, he's thin, he appears well groomed. he was one of the earliest friends I ever had, so early in my life that I don't remember our relationship's origins because they extend outside my life cycle memory range. at the same time he's the person standing in front of me now..but not.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>steph texts me making :( about me not saying bye to her before I leave. the last time I saw her was when she leaned in through my bedroom doorway after our little room party. the last thing I said to her was &quot;good night.&quot; I never got to hug her before I leave. I press her for answers after asking what about me she'll miss most. she says it will be the way I smile when she hugs me. once my heart would have leapt. I relay her words to pastafu and confirm that no, I'm not touched by this false emotion at all. besides, she kills the conversation quickly afterwards.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sam and david are the only ones I truly say bye to. sam and I hug awkwardly. expected. kelly comes with him and pointlessly says hi repeatedly. david says we will have to have skype dates, and I don't believe either of us will hold up to that.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>mike texts me today too, surprised that I'd already left. a typical text containing excess exclamation marks and positive wishes that sail far over my head. and that addresses me as &quot;mannn.&quot;</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I doubt anybody else will ever be thinking of me and I'm so perfectly fine with being alone from them.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>is finally being free of my &quot;friends&quot; unclouding my vision? I'm starting to side with V on a lot of arguments that I took a heated stand against when texting him whilst hanging out with members of our friday gang..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
05-10; thursday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm tackling what's left on my list. I don't want to get too systematic with thoughts. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a few details I remember from the beginning of the year. I'm the first to move in and spend nights at the apartment. tam comes by to drop off some stuff one day. back then I was excited to see him; he was the first person I saw at tech since summer, I believe. and all he gave me was his signature unenthusiastic wave without a hint of any smile. I thought, at that moment, about the familiarity it had achieved by now and how his person hadn't changed all that much. I think I smiled about it to myself inwardly but I don't know why. I wake up one morning to kenny and his parents barging in and me ignoring his call asking if anybody else was inside and hearing him swear at his mom over petty moving-in things. hanging out with alex, who I'd almost never talk to after my first few days back on campus. I help him move things out of his apartment near atlantic station somewhere. we visit mike's new home one night, where steph and I think sam and kelly are also. I feel crushed when I see a snowglobe encasing picture of him and her together. I'm with them as we eat out one night at a salad buffet that I despised. steph asks me if I'd like to eat lunch with her tomorrow and I awkwardly answer yes while not letting myself get too excited because I know there's no way it'd be just the two of us eating lunch together and the next day it's everybody who was with us last night all over again. me walking around the kitchen area listening to the lonely island &quot;after party&quot; by myself and concentrating on the weak afternoon lighting that made its way through the blinds. I remember the loneliness twisting at my heart. loneliness that, after this spring semester, I'm starting to love, that I'm starting to want to crawl into and live in by myself where nobody will see me except someone curious enough to in. exhausting fall class schedule requiring trolley rides to the management building where my roommate abandons me for new friends of his who don't pay attention to me either. classes interspersed with disgusting student center meals that destroy my meal plan and force me to continually reload my buzz card, which would drained again by the next week. cs2340, such a disastrous class where I fucked myself over so incredibly hard and felt horrible about getting the undeserved A. I continue to pour my minimum dose of effort into every class and that dose shrunk even further in the spring. I paid for that. I work with lisa xia frequently on cs1332 homework, the only class that I truly glided through. fall ends and we never hang out again.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>what I remember from the day I left jonathan, of course, gives me a tight hug, apologizing for &quot;being a jerk all semester.&quot; I actually don't think he ever was a jerk. I'd heard he was mad at me at one point early on in the year, but I never pinpointed what about. I don't see our relationship being able to develop any further so right now it looks like halfhearted waving only for when we see each other on the walkways. michelle hugs me. tam stands somewhere and I glance at him looking in my general direction. he reminds me to take my backpack. funny how I forgot about that. jonathan and david help me carry my things outside. I say a final goodbye to david at some point in there too. sam stops by twice, the first time with kelly who I barely glance at while she says hi repeatedly. in a nutshell I pack my shit up and get the fuck out of that room.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this semester was ultimately a failure. I'm only now, after moving away from friends and the familiar tech atmosphere, realizing just how cloudy I'd let my vision become. I can't believe that I genuinely thought it went by smoothly. I was constantly hitting enormous potholes, that started from the very beginning in fact, and somehow managed to convince myself that my ship wasn't leaking and that my ship wasn't listing and that I was sailing quite smoothly.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm furious with myself for letting my friends drag me down. I've told two other people that now and by my friends I mean specifically [logitech] because he's the one I had several classes with and was directly involved in my work ethic. and he killed me completely. I have to be very careful to not put all the blame on him though. I'm sure it's still myself I'm angry with, myself who I know I have to change in time for next round. I've gotten a lot more social this semester, had more friends than I've ever had. people who I believe cared about me, and I cared very much about getting to see them and hang out with them. I'm not even talking about my crush here. but I put too much unnecessary effort into them, failing to prioritize correctly and letting myself sink in academic failure. failure because I know so strongly as I look back now that I was so capable of achieving the best if I had taken the time to gather and utilize all of my available resources. but he drained me. of drive and motivation and I ended up trudging through mud. I really resent that. I have never been so genuinely angry with my performance. I have to manage social and study life separately. I made a dangerous mistake by electing instead to leave study behind in the dust. it made its way through the storm, as I was always promised it would, and bit me hard. I'll never be able to make myself tear myself away from them entirely. that's just not possible, nor is it something I want to do. I'll remain genuine friends with them. my heart, I hope, will still want them by my side because I still need them. but I have to be very careful now to filter the influences they're going to have on me. I'm going to act independently of them because I'll be a complete self without them. they're just icing. I want to be able to drop them should I really have to. leave them behind if I really have to. they are noncritical. I understand a little bit of v's attitude towards school now, manifested in his texts that I had always shaken my head at, exasperated. the day I saw my grades though, and stared directly into my friends' drag instead of just keeping it in the corner of my gaze, I suddenly seemed to know what v was getting at this whole time. still getting over the revelation that I was so very very wrong in placing this much stake in my infantile &quot;enjoy life&quot; sentiment. that when I lay back and leave business out, it does collapse after all.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
05-12; saturday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I didn't expect my sense of time to be thrown off this much. I practically just woke up and it's already almost 5pm. I guess it's been too long since I was last jet lagged to be able to predict its effects on me. I think I have several sleep-lacking nights ahead of me. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my biggest worry right now is not being to make the most out of being here. I have to be careful to not hole myself in anywhere. everybody else seems to perfectly at home already. I gathered that several of the people I followed around yesterday had been to this city several times but the rest I have no background on, I have no background on anybody or anything here. the newness is supposed to feel exciting and refreshing but I find it nothing short of terrifying. I've never ever indulged in the experiences that everyone is eagerly anticipating amplifying here and I don't know a word of spanish or how to handle myself out here. I don't know where to get myself sustenance. any type of sustenance. I can't call or text people I know now and all I can do is wait for emails. I'm worried that I don't know how to enjoy myself and my self-contained prison will keep me from trying hard enough.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I tried a mango flavored mojito yesterday, my first taste of alcohol. it tasted as bad as I expected it would to me. it was all sorts of bitter taking over what sweetness the mango provided. I've already talked about how every single person in the program seems to be centering their focus around drinking. I continue to not understand the pleasure that is universally shared around the activity. I tried a sip of some wine later too. it sparkled but quickly after that a horrible flavor filled my mouth completely. I still don't get how people enjoy this stuff. it just tastes so bad. then again I've never gotten drunk, and there's no better opportunity than here. I'm just too scared.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I didn't go with the guys who went clubbing last night. too much of a culture shock for me. I just don't dwell in these types of things and don't think I can handle it. I can somewhat gather how some people would see it as not living life to the fullest because of how heavy a source of entertainment it's been for them.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I can't dance.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the 9 hour flight passed surprisingly quickly. I was on an airbus A330 and they had no usb or power outlets but I quickly found that I'd need neither because they had a nice selection of complimentary movies. the only reason I pulled my laptop out and watched a movie on it was because it's what I'd envisioned myself doing and I wanted it to happen. I kept looking around for people wearing the grey ATL-BCN shirt. it made me feel less lost. they were nothing for the moment but they were all I had. I was one of the last people off the plane and hurriedly caught up with the rest of them, trying to stay near the few people that I had exchanged any words with at all. on the bus ride to residencia onix I was one of the few who sat alone.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I wonder if I'll miss anybody here by the time I leave. maybe too early to start thinking about this since summer hasn't even really begun yet. not for me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it could be worse. I could have a heavy laptop with no plug adapter, a shortage of cash, too many clothes to keep track of.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I can't experience unreality anymore. I'm in europe I'm in spain. I'm over 4000 miles away from any of the places that could even be considered home. I simply shrug it off. I closed my eyes, went to sleep on a plane ride, and opened my eyes but didn't wake. some of the buildings and cars look a little different. no big deal. my room's a little off too, but that's fine. dollar bills looks funny. people speak gibberish. nobody is black or asian. I'm in a city. it's beautiful, maybe.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the color and the noise doesn't invade my senses and I'm scared that this will all stay a dream that I won't remember when I wake up. I've been having a harder time remembering my dreams lately after all. I'll sit up in my real room and realize that I actually was sleeping in my own bed the entire time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
05-16; wednesday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I've given myself a lot of catching up. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last entry was on saturday. today is wednesday and the time is 13:00.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>retrieving events that happened in the last three days..most of our group went on sabir's walking tour of the city on sunday evening where I talked to dan fitzgerald and michelle partogi for the first time. companionship was new enough for the conversation to stay introductory.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>people:</div>
<div>sabir khan. our architecture professor. he's very passionate about his subject and speaks for a long time telling us about everything. some kind of accent. spanish accent? he speaks spanish I think after all. learned from other professors that people like to do impressions of him. lightly mocking/making fun of him. harmless.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>dan fitzgerald. used typical casual conversation starters that burnt out very quickly. deep voice. doesn't smile much, making already strained conversations more awkward. deserves applause for trying. his questions weren't non genuine, but several made me think do you honestly care?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>michelle partogi. along with fitzgerald. another fellow loner? doesn't appear to know or have become any closer to any of the people here. I might have to stick towards her. nothing remarkable about her at all; my level of normal, unlike most of the others who talk much more easily. she's one of me, it seems. I hope.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we walked through a park stopping occasionally so saber could speak but I wouldn't listen much. I should have paid more attention to the little things. things like the dogs running around freely and children yelling and playing outside and people simply sitting on the grass doing nothing but sitting on the grass. I remember first hearing children play while walking to mercadona. it was a young sound that I haven't heard in a very long time. immediately striking chords of lost youth sentiments. anyway. a couple making out on a bench. kids running up next to our crowd and kicking soccer balls around. so soccer is a thing here. children are always playing it and I see games being held for I don't know what on the tv at the kebab place all the time. speaking of the kebab place, I have now gone to eat there 5 days in a row since friday, twice by myself to bring home to eat alone.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on monday I wake up 6-7 hours earlier than the day before and take the subway for the first time to school. I quietly follow anybody from the group I can recognize to the trains and up the hill to school. I keep glancing around looking for dan and michelle because they're basically the only people I've talked to so far. michelle has to buy a ticket which she apparently hadn't done even though sabir kept telling us all to buy one before today and she gets left behind because a train arrives as soon as the rest of us go down the stairs to the station so there's little likelihood that she made it on the same one. I see her missing and she arrives having somehow found her way to the school on her own some 20 minutes later.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we are given a tour of the campus, which I find unremarkable along with the food. I don't plan on going to the gym ever and probably not the library or computer labs either. I am not excited at all. classes are unexciting too. saber gives us another much longer tour of other parts of the city that required us to walk several miles down a giant street called the diagonal to the coast, taking several tram rides along the way. I make note of the strange street and street corner and street intersection layouts. it appears messy but traffic seems to flow smoothly. all the european cars are small, blobby, and ugly and there a few japanese and much fewer American cars. I saw a dodge ram that looked so out of place.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it occurred to me at several points that I should take pictures because there's no other way I'll be able to remember any of this city. I've taken almost none.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on the way back to onix I end up chatting a little with a john dugan who I see as a potential friend so I stick with him and a girl named marie as we go to mercadona to pick up some water and food. john offers to carry marie's 8-liter jug of water before I can muster up any incentive. I see him and her and many others when they invite me into their room for pasta that they cooked which they ate plain with nothing. dani stoner comes in. I'm told we're all invited to another person's room downstairs so I follow them there too and watch them play the same drinking game with cards that I observed on friday. marie doesn't drink anything. neither do I. we switch to &quot;spicy&quot; uno which I actually have fun playing and during which people actually laugh when I make random interjections but I'm now able to recognize that that doesn't mean they like me for anything. when marie leaves I'm the only one to calmly say good night and she says I like you dan which my heart would once have leapt at but I'm able to filter that out too so I'm not disappointed today, the date to which I haven't spoken to her or anyone else I was with monday night since then.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today I managed an intermittent morning conversation with michelle in which I learned that she too has no plans for our week off. she has slight interest in visiting madrid. I asked her &quot;by yourself?&quot; but I don't remember what she answered. she reminds me that we were advised that this wouldn't be our last visit to europe and to not treat it as such. I almost immediately decide to not try to travel to other countries around europe but am now not so sure it wouldn't be a huge waste. I remain empty and undecided. fitzgerald walks up and initiates another one of his adorably substanceless convos.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I end up sitting at a table with urvashi, kush, and chris julian. got to know chris and urvashi that much slightly better. they let me play with their DSLR cameras. I realize that chris's voice and way of speaking heavily resemble those of ying cai. interesting.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I see sierra brader walk into the cafe by herself, get food, and eat it alone outside. aww. the only person I've seen talk to her is michelle.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I've been taking comfort (NOT reveling) in seeing other people walking and sitting quietly by themselves. for just the moment at least, I'm not the only one who's lonely..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>these classes are all going to suck. my schedule is horrible and the 40-50 minute commute is going to get tedious quickly. I'm completely unable to grasp the stretch of time I have left ahead of me that I may have to live through like this. 71 days until we leave. I already want to go home. two of my classes will involve too copious amounts of writing, I've been getting less than 6 hours of sleep, architecture class is going to be a bitch full of bullshit led by a professor who I already know I won't be able to impress because I'm never able to impress teachers.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I have nothing to do here but wander and pray.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
05-21; monday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>made a trip to what a caption on one of sierra brader's photos on facebook says is perhaps the best chinese restaurant in the city with a group that ballooned to over 20 people. went to bed not hungry last night. it was a strange sight, watching and listening to the asian waiters and waitresses speaking fluent spanish. I switched over to chinese and understood what they were saying. it was a victorious moment for me that I eagerly shared on facebook that night. successful. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it's past 2 when I go to bed and my roommate is still up finishing homework. I fall asleep before he finishes. everything is normal when I wake up. I don't wake him up this morning, and he doesn't show up during our first class. I hope he's not vandalizing my things.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in-class ethics discussion when dan fitzgerald voices his disagreement with one of the arguments our textbook presented against the ethical theory of divine command. I felt sort of guilty because I've been using more and more rationalization to reason that it's okay to drift away from God for a while. dan had flung a rope at me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>after class milaena roberts walks by herself down in the direction of the subway station.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
05-24; thursday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The behavioral resemblance between chris julian and ying cai is uncanny. asian but not very asian, skewed sense of humor, manner of speaking, even their voices sound similar. this is just extraordinary. his IM mannerisms are not as intimidatingly quirky, however. I hope I can get along with him as we progress through our architecture project. I'll have to consciously maintain the perfect manifestation of weird. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>when a flood of people I know, who I'm not close enough friends with to casually begin conversing with but who are all happily talking amongst themselves, having somehow built stable bonds in a short stretch of time I can't make anything with, spill into the small cafe, where I've been sitting peacefully by my lonesome with a calm layer of silence having settled around me, bringing with them their rambunctious camaraderie at which I scowl while it destroys my silence.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I recognize everyone who's tagged in the facebook status updates and photo uploads as the people who I had been hanging around with (more like trailing) last night, the time during which my subconscious had quickly begun building a bridge toward only to realize that the sea it is to cover extends well beyond the horizon continues to be cloudy. The others fly over while I stand stranded on my bridge.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The awful calm when the words die after one or two of us get up to leave, leaving myself alone with the last one. human presences are impossible to ignore.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I continue to rethink which side I want to be on. silent, reserved, big mind, little expression, keeps to himself. open, rowdy, doesn't find it hard to talk, loud, outgoing. I struggle to decide the ideal balance of the two I want I straddle, one that keeps my real self intact while boldly experimenting with and developing new facets extracted from the still-new crowd of people I'm trying to join.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I never moped TOO much about feeling left out in this environment that I have no choice but to call home for now. I have several potential budding friendships forming but at the same time I believe (and this has been well before I arrived at europe) that I've learned quiet well to be content by myself. do I love me yet? I'm perfectly fine being in a room alone. I recall instances when I was turning decisions over in my head not looking forward to the time when I'd have to finalize them, such as my job situation and my mother's repeated suggestion that I take a semester off from school. but I wouldn't be able to see my friends! I consistently thought to myself immediately, prompting a complete negative to any of the ideas that would mean relocating away from my lovely ACF friends. but now. I'm certain I don't need them and have begun to feel stifled by bonding myself too tightly to them. I'll still love them, but I'm they now are and will remain no longer critical components of my emotional well-being. I'll feel free to create my own life without anybody in it (initially, it'll be open for populating of course).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I know marie's always hanging with shaun, but yesterday she told me, after I suggested using nacho cheese in a cocktail, that she's glad we're friends because of all the funny random things I say. it probably made my day. have I already established that kind of aura around myself to present to everyone here? because I definitely was never aware. I can't think of any other funny thing I'd said while with her, nor had I even been trying to consider (oohh..that night when we went to shaun/paco's room) us friends because of how we're in each other's lives but don't interact. I don't know what her perception is, but the fact that she simply said those words could mean just something.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>mike posted on my wall. His use of haha, man, nice, annoys me. I unashamedly tell him I'm going to a club, probably hoping others will see. they do, and I'm pleased with the unexpectedness. it's good to note that I didn't look for that fucking sense of reward that used to come when people came flocking to a post of mine. fuck it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>why won't anybody look at me in the eyes when they walk up to me/I walk up to them/they sit down at the table I'm at? fuckers.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'll most likely go through with my decision to club/probably drink from midnight at 6am today and am sorely hoping it will be at least as good as last friday and that the potentially huge group won't leave me in dust.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>

05-27; sunday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at school in a generic futuristic looking city. I take a train with a group of 4-5 others to our designated school building where we have a project to do. one guy takes over our group when we get there. he orders for one of the girls to be locked in the backseat of an old car and another to be locked in the trunk. I reluctantly lock the trunk. I think he wants to leave her there to die. after a few minutes he disappears, the rest of us are still here and I take the key and open the trunk again. she's curled up and crying. I keep gently reassuring her and she crawls into my arms. we escape. and run throughout the school building, ending up on lower level floors and leaving though a smaller back exit. I get back on the train. suddenly instead of being next to her I'm on the phone with her and I ask her what her name is. it's kymberly something. I think I could maybe search for her on facebook later. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'm forgetting. I'm forgetting about my reserved self and about God and prayer and worship and church and service and the leadership I signed up for at ACF. I feel a reluctance to go back to it when hannah and david remind me. I mention as little of it as possible while trying to not humble-brag about getting drunk. I want to become like the people I've met here, who are somehow almost all the same, always drinking and clubbing. is it because we're in spain? the few who stand out stand out very sharply. some of us are giving in. I'm giving in. they're not irresponsible or dangerous but they lure me. it can't possibly be taking over me so completely. I've only gone to one club and have drunk once. I'm hesitating to go back to God, but I haven't gone anywhere on my own and there's nowhere forward to go either. I don't want to devote myself completely to either side. is that possible? to straddle valid middle ground?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>God kept me from drinking and clubbing last night and is leading me back to Him via dan fitzgerald. I know it. why else would he call out of the blue specifically to ask me to hang out (where hanging out means apparently singing worship with him as he plays a piano)? I'm going to be very, very uncomfortable.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it was very awkward because it was just me and him in a little soundproof room and I refused to sing. he had no concrete plans and I had nothing in mind. it was my job to follow. he decided to read james and I read a little bit of james. we went up to his room and he told me all the reasons he knew that christ is real. I felt no different about it afterwards. he has pictures of jesus all over his walls, his bathroom walls too. had a big bible and several books on catholicism. I think he might've called me because I had talked to him about ACF on the day we met. he and I could be the only christians in our entire group. though I've observed other people saying grace before eating, but they also smoke and get drunk and have had sex and that seems not-christian to me. so it's just us two and those couple other people who tag along but don't really associate with the bulk of our group, abruptly thrown out of our christian-y communities we've gotten used to at school, and having difficulty finding our &quot;niche&quot; here. we went to the kebab place for his dinner (5 hours earlier than when spanish people usually eat dinner) and my first meal of the day. I'd have rather gone back to my room after that but I acquiesced to his wanting to watch a movie at the tv room and we watched some SNL skits that I didn't understand. then he thanked me for hanging out with him. he likes skipping steps when climbing stairs, has a slight fear of not having enough to eat so he eats slightly more than he has to, and is afraid of being late to things so he likes running to class. he has a little head and a long neck and reminds me of an ostrich.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>several lines in the first chapter of james we read stood out to me. verses have never blared in my mind so loudly before. I'm not going to look back at the verses now. they involved hearing rather than doing and being double-minded. I'm both double-minded and a hearer. I haven't been a fruitful doer. I'm double-minded because for the past month or more I've been debating to myself over how much I really need God when the answer should always be always. completely. whatever's convincing me that I don't need Him or my friends who believe in Him and that I can find all I need in the acceptance of those who drink and party by drinking and partying is probably something like Satan and I should ignore Satan. not necessarily alcohol and clubbing, but Satan and temptation. learn the difference. I can have fun without Satan. as long as I don't forget about God. as long as I don't forget that everything good comes from Him and not me or the things I do. I'd like both, but need to remember which to favor.</div>

; 5-4 sat
<div><br/></div>
<div>; 5:47 am</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it's (very) early morning and sam is currently sleeping on the living room couch. steph is sleeping on his mattress in his room, which he hasn't used all year. it's nice to have stuck with them until the very end (of the year). i would consider it a success.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this past week has seen huge ups and downs in my emotional roller coaster. being depressive and also sort of happy at the same time is taking its toll on me again. a week ago or so, i came to the conclusion that like it or not, jesus is the one thing remaining that binds me to my ACF friends. i wandered into a lot of dark corners last summer, i told myself, and i insisted on staying in them for harmfully long periods of time. i've wasted an unimaginable amount of time this year. this time, i've really blown it. enoch is leaving ACF, and i never got a chance to repair the relationship that i had severed and watched decay week by week. after climbing out of my (deep) hole that i had dug for myself, out and back into the sunlight, i feel that i'm right back to where i was one year ago. i'm running out of time. so much of it has passed, and i've made no progress at all. i've regressed considerably, actually.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on tuesday, i went to midnight breakfast with sam. we didn't have a large group like we did last year. sam didn't eat much of his food and gave most of it to me. i wonder if he only came because i asked him to. lately i've been getting the feeling sometimes that he doesn't like me as much as he used to. it's the same case with ritchie, who seems quieter around me. i thought back to when i first met him, and had felt that same vibe. sigh.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on wednesday, i rode in sam's minivan and saw his house. we were moving his things out of his room his house looks and smells old. it's dirty. inside it's a huge mess, which i kind of liked. what history is buried in the big piles of stuff sitting everywhere there? we went to five guys afterwards and i thought that it was slightly strange for us to be far from campus, for me to be with sam and eric, sitting in a five guys.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on thursday anjaly ran into me during my final psyc studying. she reported that she would having her third final that day, and that she hadn't started studying for any of them until yesterday. and that she would play with me &quot;tomorrow&quot; (today) if she had the time. which she apparently didn't, because i've heard nothing from her. nor from melissa. this is now 100% expected. later there was another big ACF hangout that started in david's room, a movie and pizza type thing. the movie was 'bill and ted's excellent adventure' and monique went on about how nobody liked it except her, david, and me. i hope she was glad that i liked it. she saw my big grin, biggest grin, she said. i hated playing knockout on the basketball court. david's brother stopped by after i tossed a frisbee around with nick, and i didn't say anything to him. i refused to join them for a second movie after reading david's texts, which felt a little bit cold to me. one thing to keep in mind: no one's going to miss you when you're gone. that was the last time i saw mo.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i remember messaging steph, a year or two ago, about how studying for finals sucks. i bet i could go back and find it now. we haven’t talked that much.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at 3 am, i messaged jennifer because there was nobody else to talk to. nothing happened.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i spent today (friday) cleaning and packing. sam still seemed uninterested in talking with me. but i did end up hanging out with him again, with ritchie, steph, and mike. was i welcome there? i don't know for sure. one other kid joined us, i forgot his name. steve? all six of us walked to freeman to say good-bye to christina. i sort of hugged her, sideways. watched her drive away. mike and i talked for a little bit. shortly after we returned to the ULC activity room, he left for the night. he's one of those who'll be back here by morning for the seniors' graduation, but i won't see him, i don't think. although i probably have time to go myself, i don't really want to. sam's other sister, jessica, was also on campus for a while apparently, but i didn't take the chance to go see what she looked like. i found david in the activity room though, after i'd gone back to the apartment to get a sweatshirt. we hugged but i didn't notice him leaving after hannah and helen randomly appeared (this was when mike left too). hannah said bye to me, and i said bye back awkwardly to her and helen. didn't hug them.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sam and steph will likely be the last people i will see at school until it starts again next fall. i'll get to say good-bye to steph this time, then.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i don't think i'm as sad as i should be. i explained to mike that the past graduates have not been people that i had become &quot;close&quot; with. close, i used the word close. and to think that it would have been possible for me to be graduating along with those who are? hardly imaginable. i don't feel one bit mature enough to handle it. i don't feel like i've grown up at all.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>perhaps i'll take time to walk around the campus on saturday morning, to breathe it in a last time before i leave it for the summer.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sam told me to wake him up at 6:30 if he doesn't himself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
; 5-10 fri</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>; 10:00 am</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i left one week ago. i'm late.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this sucks, all the good-byes that i had been thinking about saying either were terrible or never happened. monique i hadn't seen since last thursday. i wasn't expecting to see david in the morning on friday, and when i did i was more concerned about getting my hands on an umbrella so i could walk to the train station without getting too wet. i gave sam another terrible hug before he and david drove off somewhere to their graduation. he said that this wasn't a good-bye, but rather a see-you-later. that was the last time i saw either of them. back in room 407, steph was packing up all the stuff that she had brought over, and we didn't talk until she asked me to help her carry things down to her car. i walked her down to her car. i think i saw her sister. i wonder if the short hug that steph gave me was short because her parents were there. i don't know if they remembered meeting me at the beginning of the year. i said &quot;sorry i skipped this part last year,&quot; a line i had planned earlier referring to how i never said bye to her last summer. then i messaged asta simply because she was the only person on my facebook chat list with a green dot. an RA checked me out of my room and i left.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i never became very close to the people who graduated in the past two years, but this time, the ones leaving are the ones i always thought of as my closest friends. even david. this time, it's finally their turn to leave. what's been happening is this; i always stick around those same people and end up never really bonding with the newer lower classmen. it takes me too long. even after 3 years my &quot;top&quot; friends don't exactly have me at the top of their friend list. what's going to happen if i'm really only going to be around for one more semester? i don't think i'm going to try to find another circle. at the same time i can't see myself becoming close to anyone in the freshman crowd. they had always been secondaries. i don't know how this is going to work.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this year i realized who my friends are by gauging how i felt when i was apart from them. missing ACF hurt. missing barcelona doesn't.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>still, reading my old encouragement letters is absolutely heartbreaking. reading what so many people had lovingly said to me before shines a lot of light on how big an asshole i became this year. i started that transition sometime last summer, but it really kicked in that day when enoch pulled me out of the ACF room and talked to me in private. i had posted a facebook status reading &quot;choo choo motherfucker,&quot; quoting the image of a burning train, and i thought enoch was being stupid...only because brooke vacovsky had clicked Like.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i really like some of taylor swift's songs solely because they remind me of riding in people's cars on an ACF night out. that's the main reason i like most of the popular radio songs that i do. but for whatever reason taylor particularly stands out. makes me think of steph too. especially 'i knew you were trouble' which is strange because the first time i heard that song was while in a l4d2 game finale, and it still made me think of them.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so it seems that life without God isn't working out very well. maybe i should give this yet another try. before i waste even more time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now that i'm back home, i've switched over seamlessly to my &quot;home&quot; reality. i tried talking to david but it was too boring. are the video games really the only reason i stayed inside my head for so long this spring? i haven't recovered, and i can't do that with them while i'm here at home, but i want to now. shame i only started bouncing back during the last couple weeks of school. now i only have new people to practice on. i never got to &quot;play&quot; with anjaly. i wish i could be on board with her usage of the word. steph had talked to me at least twice last summer, seemingly just to talk (before i likely turned her off by mentioning what i was doing abroad). will anyone do that for me this time?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>v isn't coming back here for another two and a half months. he keeps asking me to pray for him, and every time i say okay even though i never do it. i used to tell him that i don't pray anymore. i've also been getting the urge to pray before eating again. sometimes it hasn't felt right not to. i guess this means i should take my bible out of my closet. i had left it here after thanksgiving.</div>
<div><br/></div>

<div>i'm just going to type tonight because i'm worried that writing will take me too long and it's already past midnight.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thoughts for the past several days include: - how terribly mundane some of my co-workers' lives seem to be to me. there was something about the way they were discussing vacation days that just brought to me an air of total misery. like they don't expect to be doing anything else with their lives for a significant amount of time. i'm only here for the summer. but these guys here completely expect to stay in their current routine for at least a whole two years before taking any kind of break. i keep asking myself if this is really all there is to life from here on out. i'm convinced there must be something better waiting for me, but not only do i have no idea what it might be, but i also don't believe in myself to be able to find it. i know that's the problem. - how awful it still feels to watch movies at the theater alone. - regarding this afternoon, the memorial day picnic we had. as i walked from the parking lot to the picnic table i kept looking around at other people and wondering how many of them actually know what this holiday is meant to commemorate. also, everybody thought i was &quot;cool&quot; for showing up in my blue plaid shirt. lisa, and both of her parents, didn't recognize me. i paid a little extra attention to the fact that she's in high school now, and not quite the little girl (along with the rest of the sisters) i had always thought of her as at our earlier house parties. she was &quot;listening to music,&quot; from an ipod, perhaps, and i put that in quotes because it reminded me exactly of the time i showed up at her house for one party with my first ipod nano in my pocket, earphones plugged in. she only had one in one of her ears, like jack. she and tracy didn't talk to each other. i didn't say a word to either of them, either. lisa opened a biology study book and read from it for a while. damn. - at least two of the friends who my brother hung out with today were girls. granted, that's not unusual, but it took me aback. i certainly never hung out with any girls in my freshman year. - and tom wants to hang out with me again.<br/></div>

<div><br/></div><div>So it's actually been two days now. yesterday morning I woke up remembering that I am now officially a Tech graduate. Remembering, and not realizing... that has always been a battle. Others await the tide as well. Some cry, others don't. I decided that the last people I saw at school that day would be my favorite. I discovered that I give terrible hugs. Seeing Sam again gratefully shattered some ice, and I didn't mention David's dad to him. I touched Steph's bare shoulder. The farewells weren't terrific, but at least they were said. I kept on repeating, &quot;I'll see you soon.&quot; I don't think that makes a good catchphrase.</div><div><br/></div><div>The music lost every bit of its temporal qualities. And in fact I don't think they'll work up here either. I will be on a plane to China in under a week, for a trip that will only last 10 days. That's longer than London, so there will be a unique opportunity there, but I don't want it this time.</div><div><br/></div><div>This overwhelming apathy is solidly rooted like nothing else in the world. When I go back, what will be different?</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
5-6 t</div><div><br/></div><div>It's a shame there isn't more to be remembered. At least I filled (half) a notebook with the spring semester.</div><div><br/></div><div>There really won't be anything more to say about this week. Next week should have some more interesting stories.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
Today is the 9th of May</div><div><br/></div><div>Still uneasy about visiting Hong Kong. I don't know if I'll enjoy myself this time. But I might as well try. Just don't expect anything, ever.</div><div><br/></div><div>I wasn't there for David when his father passed, and I wasn't there for Zora on her birthday. These are bad indications.</div><div><br/></div><div>I just realized today that when I first saw Sam at the pavilion, his mom saw me before he did... and recognized me.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div><b>5-3 n</b></div><div><br/></div><div>I need to be careful because the smallest setback to my momentum can be disproportionately damaging, kind of like the butterfly effect. I&apos;m back at the [tea party] again and I don&apos;t know why. the place isn&apos;t fragrant, nor does it reek. strange things are happening. I needed to get outside because I was literally doing nothing, laying on my bamboo mat and staring at the ceiling, leaving Family Guy playing on the main rig, filling up silence. I suppose the change of environment is nice, but isn&apos;t home. nothing good has happened here.</div><div><br/></div><div>today saw such a momentum hit. my excuse is that the meetup group seemed very uncoordinated, with people bailing left and right in the days preceding, and nobody commenting on the thing. there was a little more uncertainty than I was willing to handle this afternoon, so I didn&apos;t go either. at least one person did, saying that he couldn&apos;t find anyone. there&apos;s a possibility that I didn&apos;t miss out on a lot, but I&apos;ll never know. I actually texted Angie asking if she and her movie group would be doing anything after their age of ultra showing and they are, apparently, so that&apos;ll be my outlet for today. still a little weak, though.</div><div><br/></div><div>I bought the same tea that Abbey had last week.</div><div><br/></div><div>on Friday:</div><div><br/></div><div>I drove to the dinner place and when I got there I immediately thought, &quot;why did I come here?&quot; the big woman I sat next to was named Rachel, which seemed unfitting somehow, and she remembered me from another meetup that I went to some time last october or november. and then I was able to remember too. she kept talking to me in a playfully (hopefully) condescending tone, about my not getting a margarita (most people there were). I think my less developed version wouldn&apos;t have been able to keep up with that kind of talk, but I was kind of proud of myself for actually having things to say. furthermore she was laughing at almost every sentence that came out of my mouth. I&apos;m sure that&apos;s not a bad thing, but I don&apos;t want to interpret it in any way. later that night, Krish came over to my apartment for a short while. it was a little bit surreal but only for a moment. should have focused on the dreamy feeling a little bit more. I wasn&apos;t excited. of course having my first guest was nothing like I wanted it to be, nor was it a big deal. no way he could hope to fathom the significance of the event he just took part in. he repeatedly: remarked how nice of a place I have; declared that I need to have a party here; confirmed the amount I pay for rent each month. also that I seemed more outgoing than I was just &quot;two weeks ago.&quot; positive charge. I told him that I had asked Abbey out too and that she&apos;d rejected me. he kept apologizing, for she had accepted when he asked, and he&apos;d kissed her at the end of their date. I didn&apos;t care that much, and won&apos;t care unless I water the thought. he let slip that the kiss was awkward and didn&apos;t want to talk about it. I didn&apos;t press him after he said that he didn&apos;t want to talk about it. offered me basic strategies to the numbers game and gave out pinches of advice. no breaking news, but his sharing makes me think that he&apos;s a genuine person. he&apos;s the only lifeboat I have right now and I&apos;m still too nervous to trust him.</div><div><br/></div><div>then we left to see the new avengers movie, still discussing dating, and I started feeling more at ease with firing my weird quips every now and then, like I would with V. it ended at 2 am so I was fairly tired afterward. when I woke up the next morning it felt like a dream.</div><div><br/></div><div>I always neglect to call my parents even when I&apos;m not busy.</div><div><br/></div><div>-</div><div><br/></div><div>so yeah, I hung out with Angie again, and three other random people who were all at least ten years older than me. stupid, I ate a burger. stupid because I feel like someone who doesn&apos;t know what the fuck he&apos;s doing, expending my social energy with people I&apos;m not invested in at all. I RSVP&apos;d to another one tomorrow. I hope it goes well. I hope I haven&apos;t lost too much courage. inaction is the worst thing I can do to myself right now. my life needs direction.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>5-5 t</b></div><div><br/></div><div>recap of tonight:</div><div><br/></div><div>the meetup I had planned for today took place at a VERY crowded restaurant/pub, and initially I could feel myself grinding to a halt immediately. trying to keep an eye out for the things I should be doing, feeling too anxious to take the action. felt the anxiety melt away after a margarita. there&apos;s really nothing special to note about tonight because most of it was spent drunk. cinco de mayo properly? I met several people, named: Steve, Elish, Levi, and Peter primarily. most interaction was spent with them. most interaction was meaningless. I don&apos;t remember anything we talked about and don&apos;t know if I&apos;ll see any of them ever again, save for the organizer Kelli, who was a disappointment because she displayed little affection towards me, especially compared to everyone else. I thought I&apos;d settle for trying for her for a while, until I was met with no hope for reciprocation. perhaps the drunkenness dampened the impact enough. I sent her a text, telling myself with zero investment. taking all factors into account, tonight was no success, especially considering my initial near-immediate shutdown. so I still haven&apos;t found the secret, the secret to letting go. maybe one day, I will. for now, all I&apos;m doing is wondering what will be awkward later and what any of this could possibly lead to (nothing). the drunkenness, again, dampens the hopelessness. when will it change? I&apos;m so new to this game and have so much to learn. but, as with any other game, if I lay down the time and put in the practice, I will become a pro player and will be able to learn all the nuances. how will this game turn out?</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>5-13 w</b></div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;d love to report that tonight was neither a success nor a disappointment. I was still scared and anxious. looks like I still depend on alcohol to loosen myself. and I guess I&apos;m not the only one. I met a Laura Potter, a Hayun, and a Buddy, and Kelli, Levi, and Ryan (first encountered at the nook several weeks ago) showed up again. Kelli&apos;s friend Rachel is one of those people who I just don&apos;t click with even remotely. the kind where we would die if we were left alone. Kelli gave me a small single-arm hug, and never redeemed the drink I owed her. I guess I can&apos;t mesh well with her either. &quot;Buddy&quot; was fairly sociable and his company was enjoyable. I tried to focus on why I was so afraid to talk to people, especially girls. tried to imagine talking to a stranger girl and how intimidating the mere thought of it is. and my goal is to make that second nature? so far, inconceivable. I can only shrink my baby steps so much. right now, the step is just thinking about talking to women and convincing myself that it&apos;s actually within reach.</div><div><br/></div><div>Laura Potter is who I&apos;m most interested in, and again I feel like it will simply lead to nothing. I&apos;m pretty sure she was just drunk, is the reason why she was touching a lot. not intimately, just putting hand on my and the Ryan&apos;s shoulders and such. repeatedly: invited us to a brunch on sunday; asked that we all exchange numbers, touched. I thought hell, even the Ryan was putting his hand all over Laura (and by all over I mean her back and shoulder and standard places). I think the Hayun, Levi, and the distant JB share some personality elements. to a degree. have I gotten better at dealing with it?</div><div><br/></div><div>Laura did give me her number and I waited until well after I got home to text her a simple message that I didn&apos;t spend too much time thinking about. this sunday brunch business will likely end up as another meetup event. all I care about is whether Laura is even remotely interested in either of us. me, she has little reason to. I&apos;m just being real. I need to acknowledge that. a past version would have blown up her micro-signals out of proportion.</div><div><br/></div><div>when I was closing my tab I thought about complimenting a girl in a blue dress on her dress but didn&apos;t. I spent too much time thinking. and rehearsing.</div><div><br/></div><div>I tried putting my hand around Hayun a couple times. she was drunk though, according to herself. I backed away from her too much.</div><div><br/></div><div>I kept finding myself to be the only one without a conversation partner. initially I felt a rush of relief as soon as I started talking to someone, anyone. afterwards, when everyone was outside, it happened again. I sat down near Levi. &quot;Buddy&quot; mentioned the dating/pickup book &apos;Models&apos; and &apos;No More Mr. Nice Guy&apos; and the fact that he was willing to share those definitely says something about him vs. me. it made sense, as I saw him talking to several different women who weren&apos;t part of our group. I kept looking around at the men, wondering where they stood compared to &quot;Buddy&quot; and people above him. I need to learn how to escape this &quot;next time&quot; mentality.</div><div><br/></div><div>Levi and I exchanged numbers too, and he said he would text me on Friday to go out and get drunk/trashed. now what? I still rely on others too much. for initiation. he and the Hayun agreed that my voice is too low. goddamn it.</div><div><br/></div><div>I saw Laura come back from the bathroom and actually leave, but the Ryan thought she ditched when she said she was going to the bathroom. I didn&apos;t correct him, but picked up her margarita and almost finished it. maybe she&apos;s texting him and not me all night. Ryan wasn&apos;t nearly as asocial as he seemed to be when I last saw him.</div><div><br/></div><div>why am I not hopeful?</div><div><br/></div><div>there is a distinct era that runs from last fall through winter. it is manifest in bioshock infinite, lights and truslow, &apos;you belong to me&apos; as sung by courtnee draper, meetup, and to a lesser degree, computer parts and kathleenmms. I can&apos;t pinpoint this exactly. what emotions I was feeling, what mentality I was in. maybe if I replay bioshock infinite, I&apos;ll remember a little better. I miss it. it&apos;s so unique somehow.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>5-15 f</b></div><div><br/></div><div>a lot of strange things happened today.</div><div><br/></div><div>not really.</div><div><br/></div><div>but unexpected. I had to text the Levi, meaning he wouldn&apos;t have texted me like he said he would. is that just a go-to fake line now too? I still had those second thoughts when I arrived at the hookah bar. but inside I went, and there was Joanna again. she let me sit next to her. her face is beginning to remind me of monique&apos;s, and somehow I feel mostly comfortable around her. on her other side was a guy who she had gone on one date with (met on tinder apparently?) and another friend of hers, a Kat, joined too. after waiting a ridiculously long time for our hookahs and making fun of the clearly inexperienced waitress, we unwrapped the uno cards and played our way through one game.</div><div><br/></div><div>again, there were times when I was the only one not talking to anyone, but I didn&apos;t feel as discouraged about it as I normally do. I don&apos;t know why. was made fun a little bit more for being a hookah newbie. the Levi stopped responding and I refused to kill time with my phone. I&apos;d much rather stare, and think, and meditate than go on my phone. Christina, or Kristina, whichever one it is, reappeared, with a boyfriend, and gosh she is so pretty.</div><div><br/></div><div>positive affirmations: I&apos;m trying to not cling to them for too long whenever they are thrown. Joanna saying that I&apos;m so soft-spoken but that when I do say something, it&apos;s hilarious (the thing that I say, not the fact that I&apos;m saying it (hopefully)); something nice that the Kat said. along the lines of me having a pleasant attitude or something. that gives me hope because it indicates that I may emanate a positive vibe even though I&apos;m quiet. I realize I must appear similarly to someone like chris julian, or some of the co-ops at work. I was still too afraid to ask Joanna for her phone number or ask her if she&apos;d take mine, as a means of communicating for future events.</div><div><br/></div><div>and the stinger is the Kat, who stuck with me for a while after everyone else left, and stayed as I refilled my left rear tire with air again. and we chatted for a while as I awkwardly leaned on her passenger side window. does this mean she was into me. maybe I have a personality that can click with some people. if she did have any interest...I wasn&apos;t reciprocating it. I didn&apos;t know how to fill the silence, and stood around before finally just saying I should go home. it was still a unique moment and I know I&apos;ll be leeching from this.</div><div><br/></div><div>Ch/Kristina&apos;s birthday is in a few days. she called me a baby when I told her I&apos;m 22. potential invitation to birthday-related festivities. I shouldn&apos;t say this, but I&apos;m again not counting on it.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>5-16 s</b></div><div><br/></div><div>&quot;successful&quot; nights aren&apos;t really because there&apos;s no real progress being made. I realize that the way I behave is still the same as when I was at school, with ACF. I think I&apos;m thinking of ACF because we ate a pho restaurant, but my point stands. this time I gravitated towards a girl named Jessica, who I&apos;d met once before at I forget where. she acknowledged me, but it wasn&apos;t the same kind of interest I observed from the Kat yesterday. the only things I said were quips. actually leading a conversation seemed impossible. no connections were being made. for most of the time at the bowling alley, I sat in a chair and did nothing. there was a guy there named Ian who seemed awkward (not unfriendly or anything). what was HE saying? what was David Miller saying? I still get anxious about not having anything to say. I still hesitate too much as I consider taking the initiative and opening to a girl. specifically a girl, because I had no problems saying a random thing to David Miller when I had one. need to remember to remain comfortable. when having trouble animating, pretend nobody else is present. it only takes one to start...I didn&apos;t ask for Jessica&apos;s phone number because I didn&apos;t 100% want to. I didn&apos;t touch her because I didn&apos;t 100% want to. I wonder if it meant anything every time she touched my shoulder. Juliee did the same thing, so it could not-mean anything. I did casually ask if she wanted to hang out tomorrow, at another event I&apos;ll be going to. at the end of the night, David Miller was talking with (the) Sharlene in the parking lot.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>5-20 w</b></div><div><br/></div><div>some things today:</div><div><br/></div><div>I saw Valerie at the student center this morning. passed her first. she looked unhappy and only waved at me. then sat down where I could see her in the commons, after getting my chick-fil-a. I walked over to her and we talked for maybe thirty seconds. as I left, she said, &quot;see you around, danny.&quot; she called me danny.</div><div><br/></div><div>the Amber came to the gym with Mark, Christian, and me. I got to see how I look. like an idiot who doesn&apos;t know what he&apos;s doing. she has huge boobs and a round stomach. whatever. stole the front seat of the car immediately.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;ve yet to write anything about the Kat and how terrified I became of her being obviously attracted to me. can it be only because I&apos;m not attracted to her in return? on sunday she ended up dragging me (or maybe I accidentally dragged her) out to the midtown sweet hut. I&apos;m sure it was a miscommunication in the meetup messages we&apos;d been sending each other all day that resulted in us coming out in the first place. she made me nervous, and not in a positive way. I didn&apos;t want to be there. spent most of the time talking/not talking about random shit. the Kat herself was nervous and uncomfortable too. that made it even more awful. at the end she reached out and I had to give her a hug. wonder if she&apos;ll tell Joanna about me and what Joanna would say about me if she does. she gave me her phone number and that was only good because then I wouldn&apos;t have to respond to any more stupid meetup messages. she next morning she texted me a picture of herself which just scared me even more. then sent me a song link which I said I&apos;d listen to later. I stopped answering after that. I confided all of this to Krish. I haven&apos;t seen him in a while.</div><div><br/></div><div>much of my third post-college quarter has been undocumented (I only have taylor swift), and we&apos;re halfway through the fourth now. all I have for this one is the Life Is Strange soundtrack, and Mozart. no new albums. that&apos;ll have to do. the emotion that that game gives me is devastating; huge doses of that mixture of amnesia and nostalgia that I still don&apos;t have a term for. (the second quarter is set to lights, truslow, and bioshock infinite. between them there is enough to reconstruct my emotional state.) tomorrow there is another meetup for the running event that was also my first step outside. I wonder if I can relive anything there.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>5-25 m</b></div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;ve been feeling out of commission for a couple weeks now. yesterday in a desperate bid to get out of the house, and to just do SOMETHING this weekend, I went to Krish to see if he had anything for me. he&apos;d already had a meetup in mind but we bailed on that due to the traffic. I&apos;d been feeling extremely melancholy all week after playing &apos;life is strange&apos; episode 3, a big part of me was in no mood to socialize. Krish played mostly unfamiliar music in my car, as we crawled through crowded streets. one of the songs that came up was &apos;forever&apos;, which clashed with my mood because that&apos;s one of my high school songs. kind of coincidental maybe, but it doesn&apos;t go with &apos;life is strange&apos; at all. I was wearing my new shoes, which made driving slightly awkward because I couldn&apos;t feel the pedals as well as I could with my not new shoes.</div><div><br/></div><div>the place we decided on was the joystick gamebar, which was mostly empty. I think one of the bartenders there was the same one who Krish chatted up for a bit the last time we were there. I was worried that I was a little bit TOO down. even said sorry for it. we played a few arcade games, I bought a drink for him. the one I ordered had too much ginger beer in it. we didn&apos;t talk much. I wanted to act like max.</div><div><br/></div><div>I texted melissa about the game. it&apos;s taken me this long to realize what she is (nothing). today, I recognized that she wasn&apos;t interested. in texting.</div><div><br/></div><div>this is the beginning of something big. or, nothing at all.</div><div><br/></div><div>at the supermarket, I told the cashier that I liked her glasses frame. it was easy because I did like it. she had a nose piercing. after I told her, she said thank you so immediately that for a moment I wasn&apos;t sure what she was saying, or if it was in fact in response to what I had just said to her.</div><div><br/></div><div>my break away from my life&apos;s real universe needs to end. I can only safely immerse myself in a fictional one for so long.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>5-28 r</b></div><div><br/></div><div>I saw everybody again on tuesday. &quot;everybody&quot; meaning just some of the ACF people. I think it&apos;s only the third or fourth time since I moved here. mike was there. eric lee was there (he said, &quot;what&apos;s up&quot; as I walked in the door). steph and david were there. I wished I could just ignore david. I asked mike, &quot;where the hell have you been?&quot; to be honest I hadn&apos;t been sure if he was even around. I learned that sam was on the east coast, and I think he has a girlfriend for the time being. great. I&apos;m behind him again.</div><div><br/></div><div>I had on what I&apos;ve come to think of as my version of Max&apos;s outfit from &apos;life is strange&apos;, a game that, along with its music, will supremely define the fourth quarter. a white t-shirt with rubyetc&apos;s &quot;human person&quot; under a blue plaid flannel button-down, gray slim-fit pants, black-and-white skate shoes. ritchie showed up soon after. he&apos;s really skinny and had just returned from europe. on vacation? with four other people? he had visited barcelona and temporarily forgot what the sagrada familia is called. we never greeted each other. monique showed up a little while after that, apologizing for being late. we never greeted each other later. I stopped trying to talk when the pizza was ready.</div><div><br/></div><div>at ormsby&apos;s I inevitably stuck with the crowd even though half of me wanted badly to break away. but I didn&apos;t feel ready for that. I bought monique a beer. can&apos;t remember if I owed her from some distant past. alex kaster never came, and everybody left after a few games of bocce ball and jenga. what the fuck, what was the point of coming here. only monique stayed behind with me while I finished my drink. we talked about her, mostly. I&apos;ve been through what she&apos;s about to go through, only I have a feeling she&apos;ll do a better job. but that doesn&apos;t concern me. nor does whether or not she&apos;ll miss me. I don&apos;t know if I will ever see monique again. I didn&apos;t feel very comfortable talking with her as we walked out to the parking garage. I told her, &quot;well, it was nice meeting you.&quot; we hugged, awkwardly, of course, both of us mistaking the other for going for only a one-arm hug. held it for a few seconds and said a sloppy, stupid good-bye.</div><div><br/></div><div>today I tried out another stupid meetup group that EVERYBODY except me and one other dude bailed on. I asked another group of people if they were there for the meetup but they weren&apos;t. they had at least three people ask them that that night, including me. after I&apos;d been sitting alone for a while, a guy came in and I matched his face with one of the respondents. he walked around aimlessly and eventually sat down, got up again, and asked the same group of people what I&apos;d asked them. then sauntered over to me. our interaction was a complete joke. I want to pin it on him, but I wasn&apos;t willing to invest ANYTHING into him at all, either. pay attention to this. when I decided I&apos;d had enough, I said &quot;I think I&apos;m gonna mozy&quot; and before I left, I stopped by at that other group and told them it was wonderful meeting them, in a weird singsong voice. then said, &quot;take care&quot; in a similar singsong voice. then listened to &apos;obstacles&apos; on the way home.</div><div><br/></div><div>&apos;life is strange&apos; is my history in the making. tell me to pay attention to my present.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>5-30 s</b></div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m officially making this promise to myself now: this lapse in no-masturbation is temporary. I&apos;ve been doing it while looking at pictures and some video again. I don&apos;t really miss the feeling. the horrible feeling of not having a partner to have real sex with. that filled me up and plagued me during the second quarter. there&apos;s no way I&apos;m going back to that now. if I went 52 days without, I can do it again.</div><div><br/></div><div>I have to be very careful with my &apos;life is strange&apos; soundtrack. I already can&apos;t remember the beginning. not that that&apos;s a bad sign, but it&apos;s always disappointing when I&apos;m not able to recall the initial novelty. I believe it began on april 6. which would make the fourth quarter dominated by a wonderful collection of music...but with what to back it up? a month can be a long time. a month can also feel like a day.</div><div><br/></div><div>I expressed frustration to Krish about my seeming inability to learn that the &quot;monthly trivia&quot; meetups are &quot;awful&quot;. I drove almost half an hour to get there only to leave minutes later after krish &quot;saved&quot; me. another act of god, maybe? I can never decipher the Angie&apos;s behavior. her happiness whenever I show up seems so exaggerated. I guess she&apos;s just too nice a person. at least I 100% don&apos;t care what it means. every time I go to one of these, I&apos;m swamped with &quot;I don&apos;t know what the fuck I&apos;m doing&quot; thoughts. there is no reason to go at all, and I&apos;m going to stop from now on.</div><div><br/></div><div>made my way all the way back to midtown, picked up Krish, and we hopped to mom&apos;s bbq, where I had only a beer while we had a rather deep conversation that I wish I&apos;d participated more in. according to him I emanated an uninterested vibe, which is something to be concerned about, because it was unintentional. we (or just he) had a long talk about self-awareness, self-conception, socialization, and self-improvement. I described myself to him as a late bloomer. and that implies comparison, comparison to preexisting expectations, set forth by no one other than myself. he&apos;s smart, but the degree of my withdrawal is debilitating. if I were to be honest with myself, I&apos;d say it&apos;s because I&apos;m still afraid to trust him. but there&apos;s no point in avoiding that, because he as an outsider can already see things about myself that I&apos;m blind to. he asked me if I&apos;m happy with where I am. while I&apos;m happy with my progress...no, of course I&apos;m not happy with where I am now. but I also need to recognize that no single milestone will grant that achievement (at least I know things won&apos;t do). I shudder at how much of a baby I must look like to him, and others. trying to remember all that he told me. my level of introspection isn&apos;t usually present in people my age. that&apos;s a positive affirmation.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m already starting to rely on him too much. I can&apos;t help it. he&apos;s the only new friend I&apos;ve made in an entire year. literally one fucking year. this is my pace?</div><div><br/></div><div>on the way back I mentioned my method of music listening to him, shortly after he talked about his discovery of music&apos;s time-traveling (temporal) properties. I am already familiar with this and told him about how I have a playlist for each of my years at college, and he thought it was really cool and that I should include it in conversation. this...came as somewhat of a revelation. earlier, when I mentioned that I&apos;d stayed at Barcelona for two and a half months, and he then also immediately suggested that I bring that up in conversation too. for whatever reason, I had never considered that.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<!DOCTYPE en-note SYSTEM "http://xml.evernote.com/pub/enml2.dtd">

<en-note><div><b>5-8 n</b></div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s been two weeks since I saw &apos;the jungle book&apos; with alice and I&apos;m only writing about it now. we hadn&apos;t hung out since some time in january and it had been mostly radio silence since then, and she proposed it for no reason. I also hadn&apos;t gone out with anybody else since. I can&apos;t remember whatever I felt. she was wearing black denim shorts and a baseball cap. I wondered what people thought when they saw us together. what they thought of me when I was with her vs standing alone while I was waiting. I was wearing my ovadia &amp; sons black striped t-shirt. we had a good time though, eating at zaxby&apos;s afterward and then to a place called jeni&apos;s ice cream. all the while trying not to think too hard abaout the fact that she has other friends. and how often normal people do this.</div><div><br/></div><div>99 percent of the entire year so far is a gray sludge. there is very little I can remember.</div><div><br/></div><div>one time leads to another and I&apos;ve spent several dollars now parking in atlantic station next to the gap or banana republic. one time I returned to my car immediately after the meter expired to find someone ticketing the car parked behind me, whose meter had been red for a while. I wanted to ask the guy and make sure that there wasn&apos;t a problem with me, but no words came out. the guy himself was being rather quiet and reassured me that the other car was getting a ticket. he probably thought I couldn&apos;t speak english very well.</div><div><br/></div><div>christian asked me for two of my four six flags tickets. at least I always knew my initial judgments of him were inaccurate. last friday we finally exchanged phone numbers, a year after we began working out together with mark. I plan to meet up with him and whoever will happen to be with him at six flags, as I have no one to go with myself. I can&apos;t decide whether to be excited or not, because I&apos;m not truly anticipating a fun time. I suspect I&apos;ll be thinking about monique and turkey leg while I&apos;m there.</div><div><br/></div><div>went to tech campus to meet with a friend my brother&apos;s who is considering enrolling here. interaction was awkward and terrible. I ran into john dugan and the justin le, but just smiled at them and forgot to say Anything. what are they still doing there?</div><div><br/></div><div>ran into roommate wesley at the gym the other day, and his girlfriend, who I had glanced at a couple times because I thought she looked familiar.</div><div><br/></div><div>something interested that happened last thursday night. alice sent me a last minute frantic text begging me to help her move things out of her dorm and to store it for her. I had no problems with helping but couldn&apos;t figure out why she waited until six hours before her room had to be empty to ask me. I wasn&apos;t even upset about ending up staying up until 4:30. she scanned her buzzcard and I entered the woodruff dorms for the second time. I hadn&apos;t been in the building in several years. what was also funny, and I said this out loud, was that I had just watched &apos;22 jump street&apos; several days ago.</div><div><br/></div><div>these were only college freshmen whose thoughts I was concerned with. I hoped they&apos;d see that &quot;social value&quot; in me when I walked by accompanying a girl.</div><div><br/></div><div>her room looked like a tidal wave had swept through it. she had amassed a seriously astounding amount of stuff, a massive portion of which was complete waste. it got the cynical part of me thinking about how wasteful college students are. not people, specifically college students. I remember throwing out tons of my own things on my last move-out day. the various souvenirs on her walls, bottles of lotion and hair and face products, notebooks, piles of Miscellaneous Objects. paintings purchased from the salvation army.</div><div><br/></div><div>she had her laptop on her bed, a macbook air, with spotify open to her personal playlists which seemed to be filled with hip-hop music I had never had any interest in listening to. it made me think, &quot;this is what young people listen to.&quot; some time during this alice mentioned that singing along to songs together is a great bonding experience, one that I was too embarrassed to admit that I pretty much never engaged in. I can recall one time. I tried changing the songs to mogwai and explosions in the sky. it didn&apos;t work.</div><div><br/></div><div>we ordered food twice and she was getting loopy as the night went on. it didn&apos;t drag. it became 2:30, then 3, then 4 before I knew it. she wasn&apos;t sure whether she had ordered food, eaten, or ordered again.</div><div><br/></div><div>one of her hall-mates was a girl named Anna who had big legs with cellulite and a small, puffy face. she spoke very softly and gently, probably because she was drunk after coming back from a bar.</div><div><br/></div><div>on friday christian started talking about white girls flocking towards black guys, and black girls liking asian guys. I wanted to disagree until I remembered the situation with Kat and me.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m playing &apos;SOMA&apos; again.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>5-9 m</b></div><div><br/></div><div>I know it can be difficult, but I need to remember that what happens in L4D2 when I&apos;m playing with &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE doesn&apos;t matter. there are so many more important things in life...whether I&apos;m playing badly one day or owning everything has zero weight on the world. don&apos;t get so worked up about it. I need to be ahead in other respects.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>didn&apos;t really uphold the above tonight.</div><div><br/></div><div>when I told christian I had no one to bring with me to six flags, he suggested I ask bina.</div><div><br/></div><div>I think I desperately need a change of environment to shift my habits at home. lately the thing to wait for has been to settle in to my new apartment before attempting to go out anywhere again.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>5-14 s</b></div><div><br/></div><div>today is the day the 2016 GTRI six flags picnic took place.</div><div><br/></div><div>woke up at 7:02 so I would have time to eat before the half-hour drive to the park. I texted christian first. there were a lot more people there than I thought there would be, surely not all of them from GTRI. a lot of kids and teenagers. I entered the park alone while waiting for his reply to my text asking where he was. coldplay &apos;adventure of a lifetime&apos; playing on the speakers (a lot of coldplay in general). ended up finding him in the bathroom I went to, but didn&apos;t say anything until I found him again outside. it actually didn&apos;t feel too strange seeing him here, and outside of the gym.</div><div><br/></div><div>the first person I met was a large woman who I thought looked old enough to potentially be his mother. probably about as old as the Angie. she was smoking. he walked up to her and started chatting. I wasn&apos;t expecting all his friends to be this old. chris acknowledged that he was terrible at introductions after she had to introduce herself to me.</div><div><br/></div><div>I met the rest of the crowd. their names are (assuming correct spelling): Christine, Carlos, Ben, Ryan, and Aubrey. initial impressions leaned negatively, but not enough to topple the tower, and thank goodness for that. I thought Carlos was indian but I later learned he&apos;s cuban. Aubrey was a very small, filipino girl, maybe about as small as steph (possibly smaller, but I haven&apos;t seen steph in too long to be able to judge). I soon figured out she was married to Ryan. Ben is married too. and perhaps most surprising, Christine is christian&apos;s partner.</div><div><br/></div><div>realizing all these pairings as I catch PDAs.</div><div><br/></div><div>I accidentally texted christian instead of alice that I thought they were all weird. I don&apos;t know when he saw and read the messages.</div><div><br/></div><div>first ride: dahlonega mine train. it sucked. a rather kiddie ride, with jerky turns and constant slowdowns before descents.</div><div><br/></div><div>the park was not yet populated so when we made our to superman ultimate flight, there was next to no line. on the way we walked under a short passageway covered with vines, the first area encountered today that I was able to recall from the georgia tech six flags night I attended in september 2011.</div><div><br/></div><div>the superman ride appears to be identical to the one in great adventure, which I must have last visited in 2010 or 2011, with gabe, andrew, and jerry, or with lillian, sam skran, melissa piccirillo and her boyfriend, and prab/prav. I can&apos;t remember. we rode the coaster three times consecutively, and I found myself experiencing minor ill effects, which worried me. Aubrey was reluctant to ride, but relented. good.</div><div><br/></div><div>all the while doing my best to open myself up to the crew.</div><div><br/></div><div>Ryan and his wife seemed to be the most friendly. Carlos was the most talkative.</div><div><br/></div><div>it was around 11 by this time and after encountering Anne Helton and recognizing the IT guy named Evan, we made our way to the picnic pavilions, where the food was being served. a shitty hot dog and a terrible chicken sandwich. here I recognized valerie and encountered bina. she introduced me to some relatives of hers. I couldn&apos;t hear their names.</div><div><br/></div><div>waited for Christine to smoke before walking to the monster mansion for some reason. on the way we walked through the hilly area by the hanson cars, the second area I&apos;m able to recall from 2011, when I recognized the song by justice. we encountered Amber. I should have paid more attention to the people she was with, who she must have talked about all the time. but I didn&apos;t. casually asked Carlos about what he plays on steam. turns out he has nearly 1,100 games (1,056) in his library. I tried to listen as he explained all the places and sales he buys his games from. the monster mansion was like a discount haunted mansion from disneyland. it was in water so it reminded me of splash mountain.</div><div><br/></div><div>after that we went to a jelly belly store and I decided to buy a box of jellybeans. seeing christian holding a box of cocktail flavored beans inspired me to buy a second box of those. I now had something to carry in my hands.</div><div><br/></div><div>the line for the dare devil dive stage, the first ride I went on in 2011, was too long and slow, so we went into gotham city, the fourth recognized area, and got in line for batman the ride, which had the best twists and turns. a kid walked in front of Carlos in line and he energetically shooed him back. the kid replied that, &quot;it was a social experiment,&quot; and he and the group he was with quoted &quot;it&apos;s just a prank bro&quot; memes. and after that we waited for around an hour to ride the mind bender, which had the tightest loops and somehow made my eyes tear up from all the wind.</div><div><br/></div><div>that ended up being the last ride I would go on. after that we walked into a gift shop and waited so long to buy bottled drinks (we were desperately thirsty and vending machines weren&apos;t working) that we had finished them before we reached the check-out counter. Carlos made some small conversation with the teens in front of us. a bottle of powerade cost $4.50.</div><div><br/></div><div>and then it was all the games. everyone except Carlos and me flocked off to play while he and I chatted a bit. about the software work we do and what I should take my parents out to do when they come visit down here. he gave me advice about building credit and buying cars and eventually buying a condo. I didn&apos;t put in the effort to reveal that I already had a condo. I kept picking up dried fir tree leaves and breaking them up. I never led the conversation. when I left to watch Ben at the ring toss, it might have seemed to him like I just didn&apos;t want to talk to him anymore.</div><div><br/></div><div>on the way to the other area with games near the superman coaster, we passed through the promenade, the final recognized area, which is where I got my giant turkey leg and ate with monique and the crew, while &apos;you are a tourist&apos; by death cab for cutie played on the speakers.</div><div><br/></div><div>Ryan really likes the claw machines, and played several of them despite always anticipating that they were rigged to drop whatever item he picked up. he always positioned the claw perfectly and it was blatantly obvious that it deliberately loosened as it went back up. the kids watching him ohhh&apos;d in disappointment.</div><div><br/></div><div>the prices of all of these games were absurd. $4 for one ball throw. I wasn&apos;t interested at all in playing any of them. it was more fun to simply watch. I bought a small bag of warheads for $3.</div><div><br/></div><div>Carlos began to get antsy and wanted to leave and go someplace to eat. christian suggested a place known as, &quot;marietta diner&quot; and no one objected. we made our way to the exit and Carlos apparently decided to just leave himself. his bitch mode, as christian labeled it. he&apos;s in his fifties. I thought he was a mildly eccentric mid-thirties guy.</div><div><br/></div><div>we registered for season passes and everyone seemed to assume that I would be parting ways until I informed them that I&apos;d be meeting them at the marietta diner. they parked in a different area so I walked alone to my car and drove up to the diner, which turned out to be very close to the music shop where I had my flute cleaned. it&apos;s a large place that was packed with people, something I didn&apos;t expect. the exterior had a 60&apos;s diner style element to it, which wasn&apos;t at all reflected inside. waited in line for a while before being seated. the place must have had hundreds of options to choose from. it must be rather like the diner at which I met theRadBrad.</div><div><br/></div><div>more PDAs from Christine and christian, and Aubrey had something in her eye ever since the mind bender coaster that she couldn&apos;t get out. christian and I finally added each other on steam. by this time I felt significantly more comfortable talking with all of them than I did at the beginning of the day.</div><div><br/></div><div>the caesar salad appetizer I chose was so drowning in dressing that I couldn&apos;t finish it, and the fried shrimp entree I chose was a big disappointment. I paid with the wrong credit card. everyone wasted a lot of food because we were given too much.</div><div><br/></div><div>and then good-byes. I felt optimistic for some reason because I have christian on steam. I have no idea if I&apos;ll ever see any of the others again. it had become chilly and windy outside. I put on coldplay&apos;s &apos;a head full of dreams&apos; from my ipod and drove home. the only souvenirs I have are my tickets, a map of the park, and the two boxes of jellybeans.</div><div><br/></div><div>and the day is now but memories.</div><div><br/></div><div>coldplay - everglow</div><div>coldplay - adventure of a lifetime</div><div>coldplay - fun</div><div>coldplay - kaleidoscope</div><div>coldplay - army of one</div><div>coldplay - amazing day</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>5-15 n</b></div><div><br/></div><div>images: the girl driving the pastel dodge challenger</div><div><br/></div><div>how silly will I think myself to be when I look back at these early twenties and see how much time I spent obsessing over what I am now. L4D2 and clothing.</div><div><br/></div><div>I was wishing Mark were with us at six flags initially, but then, as I always do, I preferred the way things turned out as they did.</div><div><br/></div><div>I wished asta a happy birthday on whatsapp but she never answered. I&apos;m pretty sure she saw it.</div><div><br/></div><div>looks like I met Kat one year ago today.</div><div><br/></div><div>alice returns tomorrow.</div><div><br/></div><div>I started my study abroad semester in barcelona four years ago.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>5-16 m</b></div><div><br/></div><div>I really didn&apos;t know what awaited me when I left my apartment at 7:25 to help alice move her things into her frat house dorm. she was accompanied by a girl (Dina) who I initially thought looked partially asian. my first words to her [alice] were, &quot;is this too far?&quot; referring to the distance I had parked my car from the building. I entered a fraternity house (?) for the second time. it looked like parts were under construction and the inside of it looked exactly as such a place would look in a movie. beer cans and plastic cups. couches. this one was empty, though I can only imagine what it must look like when populated. a guy came with us and removing all the bags from my car was much faster with four people. alice&apos;s room with Dina was on the third floor under the roof. it was a small and cozy place with a soft couch and tiny tables and dressers and flimsy ladders leading to bunk beds. alice didn&apos;t have a mattress. she handed me her mom&apos;s scallion pancakes and I was immediately prepared to leave. Dina is Rita Kozlov&apos;s sister. it was unbelievable. the closest other event was meeting that Sheridan in monique&apos;s (?) dorm the other year. alice began digging through all the trash bags looking for her &quot;bowl&quot; and eventually gave up and texted friends who happened to be nearby, asian friends who had come from singapore and one is showing the others around the city. they dropped off a &quot;bowl&quot; and left and alice took out her jar of weed, which I had no idea was stored in my car, crumbled some into the &quot;bowl&quot; and lit it and taught me how to smoke from it. this was the decision I made today. I chose to go with the experience. I knew too much that I&apos;d regret it if I denied myself the experience. dina can do smoke rings. I can only wonder how this will give me angles to compare with my relationship with my brother and how he views things. alice and dina kept talking about food. I felt my first high hit me after a few hits, when the icons on my phone screen started zooming/blurring. this had never happened in barcelona. i felt my eyes moving. the highest point lasted only a minute, with most of the rest of time me unsure of how high I remained. I went to the bathroom a lot of long times because of all the water I drank (&quot;cotton mouth&quot;). each time there was no one else there. I kept checking the time. I kept making note of each time I said something someone high would say. alice and dina were really high. I&apos;d be able to tell even if I weren&apos;t. she constantly forgot things and kept talking about other things. and now, because this is new to me, I&apos;m not aware of how residual the effect is lasting. kind of like the first time I got drunk? we ordered sarpino&apos;s (dina ordered sarpino&apos;s and one moment I was finding everything she said funny as she scrolled through the menu) and I drove there later. driving high. I couldn&apos;t tell if I was going fast or slow. I said both. perception of time. too bad the night ended with an abrupt and unceremonious good-bye. dina and I exchanged numbers only because alice couldn&apos;t find hers. she actually ended up using it later and I&apos;ll have to give alice her phone back tomorrow. like christian&apos;s friends, will this ever happen again?</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>5-17 t</b></div><div><br/></div><div>I looked in the mirror and my eyes were red. just like in the memes.</div><div><br/></div><div>it was a glimpse at a slice of the normal life I never had.</div><div><br/></div><div>Dina kept asking me if I had stories about her sister Rita, and she couldn&apos;t remember me telling her I met Rita at barcelona (I had to tell her three times). about all that came to mind was that one quick kiss, and I didn&apos;t really want to tell her about that. she sent Rita a picture of me though. Rita&apos;s response was ambiguous.</div><div><br/></div><div>they&apos;re the same age now that I was four years ago, which I have a hard time fathoming because it feels like I was just there and am not as far from it as I actually am.</div><div><br/></div><div>wish I had taken more pictures.</div><div><br/></div><div>the experience is giving me motivation to go out and find more people, and visit r/trees, but I know it will only last so long, like a retreat high. because of this, it will.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div>5-4 r</div><div><br/></div><div>today was Zora's birthday and she turned 22. our age gap is a little smaller than I remembered. I texted her happy birthday; her response made it look like she'd gotten a new number and I someone else had received my message. but it turns out she had simply lost mine. it's strange thinking about how her age overlaps with where I was when I first began this phase. and of course she says she feels old.</div><div><br/></div><div>today I learned that Jessica graduates from her master's at tech this semester, all news which I heard secondhand because it had never been shared with me directly. if I correctly recall that hipchat conversation from last year, she's 28-29 years old. definitely does not look or behave that old. I had thought she was still an undergrad when she joined, but it's only been about a year so she must have been in the middle of it? guilty comfort knowing that she likely didn't go from behind me to ahead of me, although there are plenty of those I just don't think about. I still have some time?</div><div><br/></div><div>the gravity of all the past time and missed opportunities has not yet fully collided with me. I'll be feeling those effects whenever or if I ever escape my self-made prison.</div><div><br/></div><div>the anniversaries are becoming a blur, I can feel it happening. it's now about or over one year since six flags, since Harry left, since I bought x. and I'm not really thinking about the miles anymore. for months now I've already been losing track of when certain events happened, such as when tannour grill opened, when the chick fil-a opened, whether something happened in 215 or 2016. soon these 2-3 discrete years will melt into one block of time.</div><div><br/></div><div>it's a solid two weeks now since I received the unpleasant news and everything is about to change for better or worse. I haven't felt this level of discomfort in a long time. if I am unable to rip myself apart from my settled comforts and fantasies, I'll die this way. my life has gradually flatlined over the past three years. I graduated over three years ago and I didn't' realize that three-year mark until just before I began typing this sentence.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>5-7 n</div><div><br/></div><div>I think about Jessica a little more than I should. she's just the latest target for the time being, nothing more. I learned that she's graduating with her master's degree. it must have happened last week. I noticed she had cleared her desk of all of her tea boxes. I feel like I'd have heard something if she were leaving...so I can't count on not seeing her tomorrow. I almost want her to go. it'd make it easier to keep fantasizing.</div><div><br/></div><div>recent anniversaries:</div><div>* six flags</div><div>* beginning to keep order invoices</div><div>* kat</div><div>* krish</div><div>* life is strange</div><div><br/></div><div>2015 is only two years ago and is so, so far away. what happens while it becomes 20 years? what then will be &quot;far away&quot;?</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>5-8 m</div><div><br/></div><div>Jessica wasn't here today. I don't know if she's gone forever or if she's just on a break or vacation or something.</div><div><br/></div><div>I met with one of the recruiters I'd talked to last week. he had a big nose. worked in a dreary-looking, easy to overlook random building. kind of like how my summer 2013 building was. the office area he was in was brightly lit. two women in their 30's were talking to each other. it felt like a very &quot;ordinary&quot; place. I briefly wondered what their morning routines could be.</div><div><br/></div><div>my routine/system is very much in danger. I'm the usual anxious, stressed, and everything is just so uncertain. it all hinges on me, and I can't rely on myself.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>5-9 t</div><div><br/></div><div>I keep seeing the same girl at eats, she (and at least one of the other workers there) recognizes me now as a regular. I think her name is Alexis, may have seen it on a name tag once but haven't even been bothering to check if she's still wearing one.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>the sun is burning again, and now the warmer weather is also starting to feel nostalgic. range only goes back two years. the air conditioner too.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>5-11 r</div><div><br/></div><div>today was asta's birthday, I managed to remember that.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>5-13 s</div><div><br/></div><div>last night I had a dream involving Jessica in which we kissed, and before I woke up, I kept hoping it was real and trying to figure out if it were real or not.</div><div><br/></div><div>I posted a happy birthday message to asta on facebook but either she hasn't seen it, or she ignored it.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>5-15 m</div><div><br/></div><div>I don't know how I never realized that Jessica would be leaving, but it seems that she is indeed gone. I saw someone dismantling her monitor setup, and later someone else (new?) was sitting at her desk. two boxes of tea were still there. as I was waiting for christian for the gym, I actually saw her right outside the lobby about to walk in. she said she was just visiting. maybe that's why Marty and Arnond were waiting inside. after returning from the gym I remarked to Marty, &quot;she's really gone, then.&quot; he dully replied that she'd been gone for a while.</div><div><br/></div><div>in the evening I heard tapping sounds coming from the wall near my front door. when I started hearing (male and female) moaning I realized it was my neighbors having sex. and I felt the immediate and profound effect it had on me, a magnitude not seen since 2014. it shattered everything. everything I had accumulated and built around myself to hide behind. when I tear it all down, strip away all defenses, I have nothing and I am nothing. a mere minute of minuscule noise had the impact of a rocket. a massive disruption. things I thought I'd known, but not like this. my thoughts swing wildly. depressive wave? motivation? I think again about the stress of my current situation and feel completely inadequate in every respect. shocked (temporarily) out of the burrow I've comfortably buried myself in, I examine my latest hard set patterns of thought and see how laughable they really have been, this entire time. I'm almost 25 and it'll never be the same.</div><div><br/></div><div>asta seems to have changed the visibility of my birthday post. that or she has her settings custom on all posts.</div><div><br/></div><div>I texted melissa out of the blue, and I don't expect a response. I don't know why I sent it.</div><div><br/></div><div>what I really see now is how pointless it is to be engineering my memories, obsessively basing them around transient objects.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>5-16 t</div><div><br/></div><div>funny how the sex noises I overheard yesterday affected me as much as they did, when people like asta, alice, and zora have mentioned their own sexual liaisons to me. and bina's friend Meghan that one time. and when I fantasize about people like Jessica doing it.</div><div><br/></div><div>an entire three years of near-complete inactivity is now staring me in the face, haunting me. my identity, for so long, has been so heavily rooted in physical things...this can't go on. so much emotional investment in things that inherently will barely last a heartbeat.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>5-27 s</div><div><br/></div><div>I flew home yesterday and the plane acted as a wormhole again. the experience becomes less surreal each time. </div><div><br/></div><div>last week I finally wore the absurdly expensive alexander mcqueen t-shirts that I bought back in january. the Alexis at eats complimented it while I lamely tried to say a scripted line.</div><div><br/></div><div>several items I've bought have been sitting in my dresser for so long that they're going on sale now for the summer on several websites, and I've only worn them a handful of times. the diemme slip-ons I've only been wearing for a few weeks, and the amq t-shirts I've worn literally only one time so far. hundreds of dollars thrown away for this clothing for me to hide behind. and I always feel like I need more.</div><div><br/></div><div>today I briefly joined a memorial day picnic with some of the usual families, except many of them were absent. I only recognized tracy, charles, and my brother's friend, a Jessie, who's always been the obnoxious type. they were all hardly encounters.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">5-1 t</span></div><div><br/></div><div>week after week after week goes by. I feel the mounting pressure that I’ve been writing about for years. I’ve completely lost sight of the earlier times. I continue to not make any changes.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">5-2 w</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>I always look for Jacob&apos;s truck and Mallory&apos;s car as I&apos;m pulling into the gym parking lot. not sure what I&apos;m expecting, not sure why I get slightly anxious at the thought of coming here. I usually turn out fine. the Phil is quiet and doesn&apos;t say much, but he&apos;s always a good sport after we roll. even though he&apos;s so much heavier and probably stronger than me. I did a little better against him today, though we were both worn out, and I felt that Jacob gave me a little more encouragement this time too. Phil said that I&apos;d be killin&apos; guys my size.</div><div><br/></div><div>I excitedly told Hannah about the big lego millennium falcon I ordered yesterday, but didn&apos;t tell her about the strip club. she and I might go to Mallory&apos;s competition this saturday.</div><div><br/></div><div>there&apos;s only silence when it&apos;s just Jacob and me, after Hannah leaves. I don&apos;t feel like waiting for Mallory to finish showering, so I tell him I&apos;m heading out too. he asks me if I&apos;m coming tomorrow, and I say a weak yes even though I was planning on skipping. now I&apos;m in an awkward position. why didn&apos;t I just say no?</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">5-3 r</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>four days ago I closed on my current apartment two years ago, and I&apos;d forgotten about that until now. two years.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>today that Winston messaged me asking if I could hold on to another thing of his. the last time I saw him was around last august, shortly after the eclipse. I had forgotten that finals week was this week. campus was crowded, the streets lined with cars full of cars as students were moving out. maybe this could be why alice hasn&apos;t answered me? but probably not.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">5-4 f</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>some time earlier this year, around february/march, the regular L4D2 play sessions with DOOGIE and Sir Boolean slowed down significantly. in april they pretty much stopped altogether.</div><div><br/></div><div>I cannot remember anything from the beginning of this year.</div><div><br/></div><div>alice warmly answered my text today. maybe she was just busy with finals after all. has she grown? she seemed pretty down to smoke together, and excited for me to meet her boyfriend too? but I&apos;ve heard nothing else from her since.</div><div><br/></div><div>today the Rashida asked me what my ethnicity is. it&apos;s pretty much the first time we&apos;ve really talked. the &quot;conversation&quot; lasted maybe thirty seconds. we went to three dollar cafe again, she joining us for the first time. the JP asked me how my week was, with that ever-present coy, sly smile that makes me feel uneasy, like he&apos;s been talking about me behind my back or something. he brought up the strip club again. I said little before he went back to talking with RJ about it and forgetting about me.</div><div><br/></div><div>Hannah and I are on track to watch Mallory compete tomorrow. I learned from her that her John owns a dry cleaning business with four locations. I would never have guessed.</div><div><br/></div><div>I decided to go another one of Angie&apos;s trivia meetups, at the north river tavern again. the last time I was there was in october. she was quite excited to see me, and I felt a little less awkward talking to her because I actually had answers to provide when she asked for updates on my life. as usual all the other people there looked at least ten years older than me, and I didn&apos;t talk to a single one of them, nor did I want to. I was in the bathroom when Angie left after the trivia ended, so I didn&apos;t get to say a proper good-bye to her.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">5-5 s</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>late to the running meetup this morning, I ran into no one except Jay at the end. he was talking to a girl I thought was cute who I hadn&apos;t seen before, and I felt more okay with the thought of asking her for her name than ever. for whatever reason, they were heading to the restaurant einstein&apos;s again, and I didn&apos;t have time to eat there because I was meeting up with Hannah, so I ditched them without really saying anything.</div><div><br/></div><div>I hurriedly ate breakfast and showered because I&apos;d agreed to meet her at 10, only for her to tell me, by the time I got there already, that her John was going to give her a ride all of a sudden, and that she wasn&apos;t even dressed yet. that actually annoyed me because I had slightly rushed to get there in time. turns out she was in no hurry at all and took her time taking John&apos;s dogs out while he showered. she commented that this was the first time she&apos;d seen me in non-athletic attire, the sort of thing I&apos;ve stopped expecting to hear from others. interestingly, she also complimented the pants I was wearing, saying that they looked expensive. huh? they were the same pair that the random guy in sarpino&apos;s commented on months ago. then she had no problem telling me more about the Steven, that he&apos;d essentially said no when she asked him out (?), that Mallory doesn&apos;t like him, that the John feels threatened by him...</div><div><br/></div><div>she invited me up to her apartment, where she&apos;d apparently had a hangout/party last night, whoever they were were up super late until just hours before. I met that John for the second time, and I didn&apos;t like him at all. maybe we come across as the same way to each other, because other than the initial handshake, neither of us said anything to each other. he didn&apos;t feel friendly.</div><div><br/></div><div>I blame Hannah for arriving barely in time to catch the last minute or two of Mallory&apos;s fight, which she lost. for several minutes I didn&apos;t realize that Jacob and Jose were standing near us too. she didn&apos;t seem too down about losing; it&apos;s not about me.</div><div><br/></div><div>I could only imagine how stressed out I&apos;d be if I were actually competing. I watched other competitors here and there, mostly blue belt and above. identifying moves and positions, trying to imagine how I would defend. I think my skill level is in that spot where I would tend to overestimate how good I am, because I&apos;ve had so little to compare myself with. watching the others fight made me want to take this a little more seriously rather than casually from now on, and for the first time I began to consider entering such a competition.</div><div><br/></div><div>Hannah and John left shortly after Mallory finished. Jacob and the others recognized many of the people there. I stood on my own most of the time, picking a fight near me to watch. when Jacob/Mallory/Jose decided to leave for lunch I joined them and ended up driving. and on the way there I realized how little I fit in with the group still. I made a mistake by nearly making a left turn onto the right side of the road, near the exit to the convention center, because the divider was so wide that I didn&apos;t even realize I was supposed to turn onto the other side of it, and Jacob wouldn&apos;t stop giving me shit for it. it&apos;s not that he made me feel bad, it&apos;s that I never had anything to say in response that started bringing the anxiety back. Mallory and Jose were bickering in the back seat the whole time. their presences just felt strange, being in my car. I felt so much conflict/dissonance, between their inherent loudness and my inherent quiet. whenever I start talking shit back and swearing, they make a big deal out of it, and I become self conscious. and I have to limit my natural self again, which I already feel I have to suppress most of the time. it&apos;s like some kind of performance anxiety. I can&apos;t keep up with their nonstop animated chatter. it takes so much energy just to remain calm that I paradoxically can&apos;t relax because I&apos;m applying all of that energy. maybe this is why, after I&apos;ve left and am *actually* relaxed, I start coming up with all these things to say that would have made for some more interesting conversation. I think a couple of times Mallory could tell I was having trouble handling it, because she stepped in and dissed them for me. but she wasn&apos;t really helping me out, just taking her own shot. there was a noticeable difference between Jacob&apos;s shit talking and Jacob asking me questions about my dashcam.</div><div><br/></div><div>there&apos;s just something about me that prevents people from being in their natural state around me.</div><div><br/></div><div>back at the convention center, I was mostly on my own again as the others kept disappearing and walking around the place. I watched the Steven compete; I think he lost, but only by one advantage point? not sure. he gave me a pat on the arm as we walked past each other, and I almost asked, &quot;how did you do?&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>petunia&apos;s name may be Lane Smith.</div><div><br/></div><div>before leaving, I sat next to Jacob for a few minutes and we said nothing to each other. when Mallory came back they immediately started talking. I wasn&apos;t about to fuck off on my own so I said bye to them. Mallory thanked me again for coming, and Jacob asked if I&apos;d be coming on Monday (yes). I felt the anxiety alleviate as soon as they seemed to give me some attention again. only to remember that it was no more than a social requirement.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>I never bothered bringing up the subject of my car&apos;s city fuel economy.</div><div><br/></div><div>I sent petunia a message on facebook.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">5-8 t</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>I think it would be better for me to just accept that Jacob et al. aren&apos;t compatible with me, and to become okay with not being 100% around them. last night I didn&apos;t bother hiding my frustration as the Walter kept choking me. I couldn&apos;t stop thinking about it. I know whatever drive I can derive from this won&apos;t last, so I&apos;m still not sure how long term I want to go with bjj. he&apos;s not exactly the only one who can beat me this easily, after all. I should work on my attitude first. I&apos;m pretty sure the rest of them could tell how I was feeling.</div><div><br/></div><div>the Gorm is back at work this week. I liked it better when he wasn&apos;t here.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">5-9 w</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>petunia finally responded to me on messenger and he&apos;s been looking at my facebook profile too. apparently none of my pictures are visible. I changed the visibility of the one taken of me on the camping trip so he could see it, and he called me a cutie.</div><div><br/></div><div>nita wants to give me crystals to &quot;enhance my energy&quot; and &quot;enhance my creativity&quot; according to her. I found it bizarre, having forgotten that she was into this stuff. I didn&apos;t want to be dismissive though, so if she wants to give me some crystal or a necklace, or something, I&apos;ll probably just take it.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">5-10 r</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>today I met with nita at the midtown sweet hut and she gave me a Beaded Gemstone Stretch Bracelet that she had bought from amazon. hanging out with her was more or less the same. she brought up potentially going to a korean spa together this weekend, and explained to me how that goes as we watched a video of conan visiting one. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m ready to get naked in front of random people, but it&apos;s another experience I guess.</div><div><br/></div><div>she hugged me twice before leaving first. after I got back to the office she messaged me descriptions of the stones in the bracelet she gave me. tiger&apos;s eye helps release fear and anxiety, tourmaline will help achieve harmony and protect against destructive energies, hematite will absorb toxic emotions, etc. I don&apos;t understand how she believes this. she told me I have to ask the stones to bring me luck and opportunity. I won&apos;t do that, but I&apos;ll wear it I suppose.</div><div><br/></div><div>Hannah wasn&apos;t at the bjj class again. rolling with the Phil was easier because he was clearly worn out already. I attempted a cross collar choke but didn&apos;t finish it because I &quot;felt bad.&quot; Jacob wasn&apos;t even looking at us while we were going, drilling with Mallory instead. I&apos;m still not serious enough about, going &quot;uh-oh&quot; when Phil bridged and flipped me over.</div><div><br/></div><div>I did some exercises with Jacob and Mallory afterwards, and they talked between themselves while laughing at comments I made. I didn&apos;t care anymore.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">5-12 s</span></div><div><br/></div><div>this week at work, the &quot;ops&quot; guys moved their workstations and set them up next to Zach and me. their boisterous conversations will be taking place right by us now, which is fine. when I showed the Danny and Anthony my groovy scripts, Danny said he was surprised that they mostly worked right off the bat, and Anthony said it was much better than python. I doubt either of them meant to commend me, but it still felt good to hear.</div><div>Nita cancelled/postponed her korean spa plans with me.</div><div><br/></div><div>Hannah continues to invite me and who else she knows to everything, asking me if I want to join a motorcycle safety course with her and some of her other friends. even offering to loan me the $260 when I used the not-enough-money excuse. then invited us bjj people to hang out at her apartment again.</div><div><br/></div><div>I saw Cody today at the running group for the first time in several weeks. maybe it was because I was late, but we really didn&apos;t say anything to each other. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s him or me that&apos;s causing these continued bad vibes. I don&apos;t want to care about it too much, don&apos;t want to go out of my way to get him to get him to talk to me. the girl I spotted last week talking to Jay was here again. David invited her to dinner at his house tonight too, so I learned from there that her name is Claire? I still didn&apos;t talk to her. I already wanted to go over to his house tonight, so I should do something there.</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s still too early to tell if it&apos;s happening, but if my mentality towards bjj can shift away from anxiety that&apos;d be nice. if I reach the point where I can look forward to it instead.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">5-13 n</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>maybe I&apos;m always avoiding writing about these social encounters because of how bad I always feel afterwards. the anxiety always builds up and it takes energy to stay. it&apos;s alleviated when I&apos;m able to converse with someone, but I&apos;m always the one who&apos;s just there.</div><div><br/></div><div>I didn&apos;t address Hannah, Barb, Cody, Tia, or the Claire by name. none of them.</div><div><br/></div><div>I stopped by kroger and bought the same jalapeno cheddar hot dogs to eat for the fifth time. there were varieties of donuts on the shelves next to the hot dog buns, so I picked a bag of hostess crunch donettes too. I drove alone through Hannah&apos;s building&apos;s parking garage, where she greeted me wearing a bikini. that caught me off guard. we took an elevator up a couple of floors; I&apos;d forgotten that the pool wasn&apos;t on ground level. gathered around one of the tables there were the rest of them: Jacob, Mallory, the James, the Yusuf and his girlfriend, and that Jeff who I&apos;d met on Hannah&apos;s birthday.</div><div><br/></div><div>I hadn&apos;t seen the James since the day I went to the bjj class for the first time. he asked me why I never told him that I stuck with the class, and I didn&apos;t know what to say. I have no clue if the Yusuf recognized me at all. I think he and his girlfriend just came by because they had each other. his girlfriend was very different from Hannah and Mallory, and according to Mallory, stuck-up and condescending. they were the type of couple who were quieter and stuck to themselves.</div><div><br/></div><div>for some reason Jacob was astounded at how good they were and made a comment about earning a stripe due to these donuts. I just wasn&apos;t expecting such a positive response from him, about donuts of all things.</div><div><br/></div><div>Mallory inadvertently introduced me to the terms &quot;cuffing season&quot; and &quot;cutoff season&quot; and I feel squeamish typing that out. it reminded me of where I see myself in this social dynamic.</div><div><br/></div><div>the Jeff, the Yusuf&apos;s girlfriend (I don&apos;t remember her name) and I were the only ones who didn&apos;t get in the pool. I had no bathing suit and the others kept encouraging me to go in. I was being swayed, but they stopped pushing eventually. at one point Mallory came back to the table and casually took a picture of her ass right in front of me. I said to her that I could take one for her. she also asked me the infamous question, how I&apos;ve been. I walked to back to the pool with her and she told me that my reaction when she popped my elbow made me unique. I don&apos;t know what she really meant.</div><div><br/></div><div>before I went over there, I spent a few minutes sitting with the Yusuf&apos;s girl and the Jeff while they talked about bicycle riding. Hannah had put a pack of hot dogs on the grill, around which another group was gathered, and for some reason both of them seemed reluctant to go over there and get one. they kept coming up with excuses to stay. I don&apos;t know what was up with that, but it stood out to me. that means others notice when I behave like that too.</div><div><br/></div><div>although the sun was out and the temperature was over 90, they eventually got cold in the water, got out, and lay on the chairs in the sun. the whole time they were in the water I was just concerned with whether or not I could out-swim them. the Jeff left on his own, followed by the Yusuf couple. the rest of us went over to Hannah&apos;s apartment, where James sat on the couch with his laptop, Jacob browsed instagram, Mallory took selfies of herself with Hannah&apos;s cat, and Hannah cooked pancakes for us all. it kept happening. Jacob asked me how I found the James&apos; butter + honey combination, and I flatly stated that it was good. that was worth a comment. Mallory hugged me again and said to have a good night or something, and I just said &quot;mhm.&quot; that was worth a comment, although that one was on me. I want to integrate myself into this group, but I just don&apos;t. know. how. I don&apos;t think any of them are bad people, but they make me feel like shit sometimes.</div><div><br/></div><div>it was around 6:30 now so I headed straight toward&apos;s David&apos;s apartment, a mile or so further south in midtown. Cody, Jay, and the Claire were already there. Barb showed up right as David came down to where I was waiting, and they both hopped in my car as I drove into the garage to park. I hadn&apos;t seen Barb since the camping trip in march.</div><div><br/></div><div>I don&apos;t want to delve into unnecessary detail about the whole thing, like what David&apos;s apartment looked like or any of the scenery. most of my time was spent just pointlessly waiting for an opportunity to have some kind of easy conversation with someone. but instead I could only talk to Cody a few times, and the things we discussed felt kind of useless and/or were things we had already talked about before. I never said anything to the Claire, who reminds me of catplant. Jay I don&apos;t talk to. Barb I don&apos;t talk to. Tia I hardly talk to; she didn&apos;t even remember my name, and instead of playing a bit with that I simply told her. David I feel okay with only because he&apos;s nice to everybody. it&apos;s a depressing realization to come to. throughout the night they kept proposing hangout ideas, and Jay especially wanted our hangouts to become more regular. I&apos;m terrified that I won&apos;t be included.</div><div><br/></div><div>we went down to the pool, another pool, where only David went in and swam a couple laps. it was getting dark and colder, and although he let me borrow some swim trunks, I never put them on. we just sat by the poolside drinking wine (I didn&apos;t have any). David and Tia were near me and they were having a deep philosophical discussion that I should have contributed to, but of course I didn&apos;t. Cody told me again about the music he likes to listen to and also recounted his recent experience with shrooms. I voiced a desire to try them, hoping to get an in. I pulled the same thing on Barb when she mentioned pot brownies. here the anxiety started setting in again.</div><div><br/></div><div>when we went back upstairs, David began cooking fish fillets while the rest of us ate the rice dish his mother prepared. the sun had set now and it was cooler outside on the balcony, the living room dimly lit. I walked back and forth, trying but not really to talk to somebody. all I ever found was Cody. we sat on the carpet in the middle of the room. I remained quiet. eventually I retreated out onto the balcony alone, and felt a little bit better almost immediately, as I was able to temporarily forget about all who were here. surprisingly, messaging petunia on facebook offered some respite from the anxiety. Jay came out to tell me we were going out somewhere. this was around midnight. I asked the Claire where we were going, one of the rare instances in which I said anything to her, and she said a hookah lounge. I wasn&apos;t sure if I should stay, but I did. Tia had left.</div><div><br/></div><div>as we walked outside along juniper, I was unprepared for how busy it would be at night. the place that the Claire had found was too expensive so we ended up turning around and walking back, buying our own hookah instead on the way back. while we were walking I was in a daze, almost as though I were drunk, although I wasn&apos;t intoxicated at all. I&apos;d given up.</div><div><br/></div><div>Cody knew how to set it up, so we watched him prepare it, and when it was ready we all smoked it out on the balcony. it was the first time I smoked hookah since 2015. the flavor was queen of sex. Barb and I kept making eye contact and kind of smiling. I&apos;m beginning to hate that. I wish I could have been as relaxed and at ease as Cody and the others seemed to be. Claire addressed me directly once, only to ask if I was going to take a hit from the hookah. Barb knows how to blow smoke rings.</div><div><br/></div><div>one of the last things we were talking about before disbanding was Ben once again. I&apos;d underestimated how much the others all seemed to dislike him. we gossiped about his living situation, how he brought nothing with him to the camping trip, how he slept in David&apos;s car because Dorothy didn&apos;t want him using her tent, how he lost the key to David&apos;s car inside his car, the weird way he was brushing his teeth when Cody walked in on him. we were going all in on him, I had no idea he was so disliked.</div><div><br/></div><div>Jacob/Mallory et al. and Cody/Jay/Dorothy et al. definitely talk about me when I&apos;m not around.</div><div><br/></div><div>how is it STILL this difficult to let go of this anxiety and just be what I want to be. with Jacob, I&apos;m afraid of how he&apos;s going to react, afraid of always having nothing to respond to his comments with. with Cody/Jay/Barb, I don&apos;t know, I just can&apos;t myself to get in the words I want. envisioning myself talking to Claire is so different from actually being there, when I actually had the opportunity to. I think she&apos;s only been in the city for barely more than a week? and was lucky enough to immediately score this group of friends. how lucky.</div><div><br/></div><div>apparently Mallory is only 21?</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">5-16 w</span></div><div><br/></div><div>rough anniversaries that shouldn&apos;t be significant: the day the Jessica left and the last day I saw that person; the day I first heard neighbors having sex; six flags.</div><div><br/></div><div>I tried messaging christian again but he&apos;s never a chatter. I told him about my elbow and he said I should get it looked at.</div><div><br/></div><div>hopefully I&apos;m still mentally shifting to a better place. I&apos;m able to retain hope for this because my immediate reaction to my bad feelings on saturday weren&apos;t to go online and buy something.</div><div><br/></div><div>I wonder if the Claire perceives me similarly to how I perceive Mallory. not ever really looking at each other. except I&apos;m not willing to pretend or believe that Mallory has any actual interest in me. this is the Claire-Mallory parallel.</div><div><br/></div><div>Barb created a new messaging group for potential future gatherings among our running club circle, and it was a huge relief knowing that I was at all invited.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">5-19 s</span></div><div><br/></div><div>the night begins at roughly 7: 30 pm and ended at around 3 am. if the others were to write about this, what they even bother to include?</div><div><br/></div><div>abingdon way:</div><div><br/></div><div>I turn out to be the first one there. Barb greets me at the door. her place is spacious, clean, dimly lit, and hot. she has all the food prepared already. guacamole, spring rolls, and black bean burgers. she&apos;s making mojitos with the bacardi she bought. I take a sip and the mint takes me back to spain. she tries a variation with the kraken I brought with me. she shows me what her bedroom looks like, and it&apos;s really relaxing. her walls are blank and her space is minimalist and peaceful. I say some positive things about her living room, and she takes a slight moment to thank me. I think it&apos;s almost the way I would react if someone were to tell me a similar thing about my space.</div><div><br/></div><div>Cody arrives second, wearing his light blue v-neck t-shirt, carrying a case of 420. we probably talk about some stuff. Jay is third. soon after he arrives we begin eating, and Barb&apos;s vegan food is tastier than I would have expected (but I had no expectations). Tia next. she and Cody drive off somewhere to pick up some wine. Dorothy arrives and doesn&apos;t take off her shoes. Barb had told Jay to take his off, but doesn&apos;t stop her. for a while, I&apos;m able to find a groove and participate in a conversation. the conversations flow and split. Claire eventually enters, and I join her, Jay, and Cody at the table. their topic turns to tinder and dating. we end up going around the table and Claire asks me if I&apos;m seeing anyone. I simply say no, short conversation there, I have nothing to add. I&apos;m not looking for sympathy, but it&apos;s still a tremendously stupid thing to say. we all start shitting on Ben yet again. I learn that he&apos;s 42, which was a bit of a revelation.</div><div><br/></div><div>David appears some time after. by this time I&apos;ve downed a couple mojitos&apos; worth of liquid and we&apos;re ready to leave for johnny&apos;s hideaway. I ride with Dorothy in her car, and along the way I find an opportunity to humbly brag about the designer t-shirt I&apos;m wearing. I let the name &quot;alexander mcqueen&quot; roll off my tongue and mentioned that mcqueen once worked for givenchy, after Dorothy mentioned someone wearing a givenchy dress at the royal wedding. as if anyone would care about my factoid.</div><div><br/></div><div>johnny&apos;s hideaway is very close to the plaza that the road runner sports store that my first meetup event happened at. the line is too long and I don&apos;t care where we change course to. I let the rest of them decide on:</div><div><br/></div><div>moondogs</div><div><br/></div><div>somewhere between my place and the mall. the street is hella crowded. this should have been a warning. I follow them up a staircase into the bar, order drinks, find a booth to sit in. here I find myself alone with them once again, and the negative momentum starts building up. I talk to no one and it&apos;s taking everything I have to keep it in check. the others come and go. Jay and Claire seem to get along so well. Barb disappears intermittently. she stays true to her word as I notice her hands wandering. I follow Dorothy and Cody around, looking for the missing, and spot Barb making out with a random chick. this is hardly surprising anymore. she went on for some time.</div><div><br/></div><div>red martini</div><div><br/></div><div>there was brief mention of the cheetah lounge and I was enthusiastic about that, but probably no one else even heard it getting brought up.</div><div>this place is a mistake. Cody pays a cover charge for me so I can step inside this stupid area. the music is shit and excruciating loud. we&apos;re packed into a corner on the small dance floor. Jay, Claire, Barb, and even David seem to have let go. I couldn&apos;t, and very soon I couldn&apos;t pretend any longer either. I was trying to fool mainly myself. I see Barb dancing with Jay, Claire, and David.</div><div><br/></div><div>Claire wants to go meet a guy. three of the others want to go back to johnny&apos;s hideaway. they all leave with Dorothy so she can drop them off there, leaving me with David. I&apos;m feeling horrible, and I think David feels similarly. I imagine Cody and the others continuing their wild night without needing me.</div><div>landmark diner</div><div><br/></div><div>I hope David wasn&apos;t too drunk or anything as we talk on the way there. it&apos;s close to the road runner place again. I guess he doesn&apos;t enjoy activities like this night&apos;s either. he opens up a little bit about his past struggles with depression and a suicide attempt by crashing his car at ~100 mph. I say fuck, man. and I want to continue talking about how I feel in situations like this, but the window closes after we reach the diner and Dorothy meets us there.</div><div><br/></div><div>they discuss the others&apos; behaviors, primarily Barb&apos;s. I feel that there isn&apos;t much to it, they&apos;re just young and horny and simply want to fool around. I guess David was a little weirded out by her. Jay comes under scrutiny too. then it turns to David&apos;s hackathon and something about the stock market and apple and I don&apos;t care about those. Dorothy and I share some breakfast food. it wasn&apos;t that good, but putting some food in me at this hour was a good idea. it&apos;s about 2 am now. I wanted to ask David if he ever wants to hang out, so I did.</div><div><br/></div><div>abingdon way</div><div><br/></div><div>Dorothy and I talk about Cody and Barb on the way back to Barb&apos;s so I can get to my car. Cody had run into his ex in the johnny&apos;s hideaway parking lot, and texts Dorothy about it as we&apos;re talking.</div><div>she asks me if I&apos;m jealous about Barb getting handsy with Cody? and she&apos;s surprised when I answer yes, but I do poor job of explaining why. Dorothy says Barb&apos;s attention would have been meaningless, because she was going all over the place with everyone.</div><div><br/></div><div>the rest of our conversation was more fulfilling because I had her full attention and she said some positive things about me. I&apos;m mature for a 25 y.o. I have common sense that Ben doesn&apos;t (don&apos;t be proud of this). Dorothy herself is a late bloomer and entered her first serious relationship at 29. I voiced my age-old concern about feeling like I&apos;m running out of time. she scoffs and tells me I have plenty of time. in fact the remaining time she allots me is basically the same amount as that which has already passed since 2014.</div><div><br/></div><div>there&apos;s a cab sitting in Barb&apos;s building&apos;s parking lot, and just after I say bye to Dorothy and prepare to leave, Cody appears, having taken that cab back here. the three of us then enter into another conversation that I mostly sit out of again, for the better part of at least half an hour. it&apos;s between the two of them as Cody relays his interaction with his ex. I&apos;m not a part of this. it&apos;s around 3 am when we all split.</div><div>but the negativity...wasn&apos;t AS bad, it wasn&apos;t AS overwhelming. and my response to it is still changing.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">5-22 t</span></div><div><br/></div><div>Hannah surprised me on sunday when she asked to hang out at sweet hut. we&apos;d been messaging a bit while I was finally beginning construction on the millennium falcon, after she eventually got around to responding to the message I had sent at 4 am. of course I said yes. I drove myself over there and felt self-conscious standing in line with her because of my light-colored shoes. they were out of honey boba when I was ordering. I almost sat across from her but let myself sit next to her instead. there I wondered if the people around us were judging me by my body language. I told her a bit about the activities from the day before, and she told me about what they practiced in class that day.</div><div><br/></div><div>we ended up driving over to the pho king. she likes my suicide knob. my voice sounded the same as it always does in the car. it was raining slightly as we walked from the garage outside to the restaurant, and I was just worried about my shoes. I wasn&apos;t hungry, and we split an xx-large bowl of pho, which she ended up paying for. I showed her the selfie of myself that I took at moondogs.</div><div><br/></div><div>we left and I dropped her off at building.</div><div><br/></div><div>the next morning she messaged me again as she was looking for a bird scooter, then later fell off it and scraped her leg. I was finally late for a bjj class, and this one was frustrating again because I got choked by someone who was there for only the first time. there were several people there who all knew Jacob and I wanted nothing to do with them. the Walter and I practiced together. I don&apos;t want to be with Jacob and Mallory but I have no choice for now.</div><div><br/></div><div>today Hannah and I were talking again and actually had a nice conversation about our experiences and frustrations as beginners. I guess it&apos;s nice to have someone who understands how I feel about it. as usual Hannah has little problem talking about slightly personal things, mentioning again having been rejected by Stephen and becoming frustrated enough one time to punch a hole in the wall in the locker room. maybe it&apos;s her way of dealing with the emotions.</div><div><br/></div><div>this time, I don&apos;t have to restrain my mind as much because it&apos;s hardly running anywhere. but it still sucks slightly whenever she brings up her John. I&apos;m sure there are those out there who would say that talking with her is a waste of time.</div><div><br/></div><div>earlier this afternoon I had my first prolonged interaction with a new developer at the company. his name is Blessed. he has some african-sounding accent and dresses superbly well, compared to the rest of us at least. leather shoes that are clearly taken care of, shirts and trousers that are probably tailored. I noticed his glasses were from gucci as I sat next to him today, assuming they&apos;re real.</div><div><br/></div><div>I think we sort of clicked as I helped him explore the tp2 codebase. he quickly identified the same issues with the Kumar&apos;s code that I&apos;d always found appalling. it&apos;s unnecessarily complex. it&apos;s borderline unmanageable. the formatting is atrociously inconsistent. there are hardcoded strings and values everywhere. the Kumar had written a lot of rest-related code when he could simply have used an existing library?</div><div><br/></div><div>Blessed even voiced out loud his doubt at whether or not joining this company was the right decision, which I thought was hilarious. I&apos;m not the only one now who feels that way. he also introduced an idea that hadn&apos;t occurred to me before: that not all the developers here learned how to program the way a school would teach one to. that would explain the complete lack of adherence to any sort of coding convention. perhaps, some of them were just cheap labor. what a thought.</div><div><br/></div><div>I went to the crc in the evening today and ended up doing squats with an asian guy named David, who had long hair tied up in a bun or something. he guessed my age to be as high as 28, I think. he himself was 23 and in his sixth year at tech. he seemed alright but then started acting a bit odd; doing an awkward job back to the squat rack after stepping away to talk with some people, then sort of running into the wall. motions and sounds while doing his reps that seemed exaggerated to me. anyway, whatever.</div><div><br/></div><div>today David left the running/drinking club messaging group, because it was &quot;affecting [his] peace of mind.&quot; could it be related to what we briefly talked about in his car on saturday night?</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">5-23&nbsp;w</span></div><div><br/></div><div>just as I was going to bed last night Cody texted me about David asking what I did to him, I&apos;m assuming as a joke. this morning he texted our group again saying I was responsible. I didn&apos;t understand his intent. I had already messaged David asking to meet up for lunch, and we just set a time for tomorrow, so we&apos;ll see how that goes.</div><div><br/></div><div>last night I slipped and began talking to Hannah about how expensive some of my clothing is. it must have been something I&apos;d suppressed for a while because I could hardly stop myself. I even mentioned the mcqueen sweater I&apos;d been eyeing for months, sending her a link to it. she was blunt with her dissuasion, which was nice to hear. I showed nita the sweater too and she told me it was cute. that might not be her real opinion of it.</div><div><br/></div><div>I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if Hannah mentions this side of me to her other people, like Mallory maybe. it&apos;d probably lower their opinion of me, but I don&apos;t particularly care.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">5-24 r</span></div><div><br/></div><div>at mcdonald&apos;s this morning, for whatever reason the cashier asked me if I like eating sausage egg and cheese mcgriddles. the line was moving slowly and she seemed irritated at other &quot;people.&quot; then said a drawn out byeee after handing my card back. that stood out to me. she was probably just high or something.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>I was hoping David wouldn&apos;t be as cold as I perceive him through his messaging mannerisms, and he was fine. he explained to me that his favorite uncle has stage 2 myeloma that went unnoticed for a long time because the doctor thought it was arthritis. I didn&apos;t know what to say. we talked for some time about programming and development, which bored me, sadly. although it was another wake-up call when he described his side projects to me (I have none). then he himself brought up the subject of why he decided to drop out of our running/drinking club, mostly citing the gossip, and apparently there were misconceptions of his motives for joining the group that were circulating around (I hadn&apos;t heard these). nothing about last saturday then. I told him about dorothy&apos;s plans to go up to yonah mountain this weekend, as she had suggested in our group text. and finally I paid for both of us, glad that he simply accepted rather than resisted. he left the door open by suggesting he pay next time.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">5-25 f</span></div><div><br/></div><div>left work early after Blessed continued to rant to me after the nonsense that is our codebase. I did okay on time this go around, and my flight ended up delayed nearly two hours so I had time to kill. on the way I used a bunch of different apps on my phone to uber and check in, and I felt like I was living that 21st century life.</div><div><br/></div><div>two people I noticed during boarding at the gate turned out to store in the very first row. another person I noticed seemed to be part of a group of people traveling together. I sat at the window next to two girls who were speaking german. the middle girl kept leaning to look out the window, something I&apos;m not used to because almost no one I&apos;ve sat next to bothers looking out the window. I think she saw me consistently jerking awake while I was nodding off listening to music. towards the end of the descent she took a picture of a bridge we flew over that I regret not taking a picture of myself.</div><div><br/></div><div>maybe it was because I was tired, but I thought the sfo airport kind of resembled newark, and I didn&apos;t need to try too hard to imagine that I was in nj as our uber drove down the highways. it wasn&apos;t until we reached the hilly streets that the unfamiliarity began to set in. I thought about what it&apos;d be like to move over here, to a new city again. is that how Claire felt? here gas is over $4/gal.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">5-26 s</span></div><div><br/></div><div>the middle of the city is similar to new york, but less crowded, with wider streets, not as loud, not as smelly, and the buildings aren&apos;t as tall. while the or areas have the steep hilly streets lined with pastel-colored, old-looking houses. mostly, it feels kind of empty.</div><div><br/></div><div>there are a lot of asian people here, and I recognized a lot of expensive clothing brands I saw people wearing, including common projects, Balenciaga, a lot of Gucci, Prada, Alexander McQueen, and Yeezy. but there are fewer expensive cars. almost every mustang I saw is the newest model with the updated front end. I also wasn&apos;t expecting to see so many of the electric scooters. or so many homeless.</div><div><br/></div><div>the realization that I&apos;m in a new and different place hasn&apos;t really kicked in. I hadn&apos;t even really ever thought about or looked forward to this trip in the days leading up to it. today I followed my parents around to union square, on a trolley to fisherman&apos;s wharf, the ferry building market, the curvy block of lombard st, and coit tower. I hadn&apos;t known about any of these places beforehand. throughout the morning and midday I became the indecisive, irritable self I always sink into when I&apos;m out traveling.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">5-27 n</span></div><div><br/></div><div>today I saw the golden gate up close through some fog. we walked across and I managed a couple selfies of myself. I let my mom take as many pictures of me as she wanted. we took a crappy tour bus back across the other side to union square, then headed for the chinatown again, a large, intense chinatown where we had some breakfast at a random dim sum place. an old homeless woman took a bunch of food that my dad offered to her. she didn&apos;t say a word.</div><div><br/></div><div>for lunch we waited in line for a restaurant that Obama that visited a few years ago, where the food was nice but overpriced. then it was off to our third hotel. my brother went off on his own to check in to his apartment that he&apos;ll be staying in for the next three months or so. I lounged around in the hotel room with my parents, where I finally set my tinder profile to visible and began using it.</div><div><br/></div><div>a short while after we ubered to the apartment ourselves and explored the space. then walked around the streets in this area of town. it looked super developed and modern. I think my parents probably have a much better realization of how lucky my brother is to be able to live in a place like this at his age.</div><div><br/></div><div>brother left us again to see his roommate inside and I walked with my parents along the embarcadero, passing the bay bridge. we stopped for a little bit to allow my brother to rejoin us, then waited for a Jill, his girlfriend? I had heard nothing about her until today and I felt a little anxious when I learned I&apos;d actually be seeing this person too. but she joined us and it was fine. we walked all the way to in-n-out burger again, and when that was over ubered one more time to the hotel, where my dad talked to the russian driver.</div><div><br/></div><div>I continued using tinder and actually got two matches.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><b>5-31 r</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>and, it happens again.</div><div><br/></div><div>monday and tuesday are a blur now. on the 28th, we went on a ferry tour that went underneath the golden gate and around alcatraz island. it was swamped with chinese tourists all flocking to the sides of the boat to take pictures of themselves. I did the same thing, attempting several more selfies. my brother hadn&apos;t wanted to spend the night with the rest of us, which I was fine with because I wanted my own bed. he joined us for the view up at twin peaks (which has nothing to do with the show) and then for whatever reason he brought us along for lunch with five or six of his friends. I was annoyed and didn&apos;t want to be in this social situation with family around. one of them ate nothing but a bowl of rice and a piece of fried tofu. I sat and tried to not seem to pissed off. that was the last I saw of my brother on this trip.</div><div><br/></div><div>so I drove with my parents down to monterey. on the way we stopped at apple park somewhere near the new circular building. it contained an augmented reality table, a full apple store, and a shitty cafe area, all populated by more chinese people. I thought it was a frightening manifestation of wealth.</div><div><br/></div><div>in the evening we reached cannery row. I&apos;d been using tinder on and off throughout the day, hoping for the next hit, and ended up paying for gold. so I was able to see that someone had liked me for whatever reason. maybe the seagull picture. we paid an absurd amount for a seafood dinner; I got a whole lobster for $50 and it wasn&apos;t bad but it wasn&apos;t amazing either. we didn&apos;t do much in this little town area. later that night I messaged the person who matched me.</div><div><br/></div><div>on the 29th we woke up early but left the hotel a couple hours after, and had breakfast at some cafe. then it was some driving, spending a little time along the scenic 17-mile drive. at bird rock, birds gathered around several tourists who fed them shit like fritos and oreos, which pissed me off but I didn&apos;t say anything. there were also several fat squirrel things running around and reaching up with their paws to people for food. drove along more scenic roads that ran along some cliffsides, where I attempted some selfies one more time. after that, it was driving down long, straight stretches of road running through the valleys. the sun set as we approached LA. we had some dinner at a carl&apos;s jr. at the airport I hugged my mom and shook my dad&apos;s hand. mom wanted me to buy a piece of fruit for myself, but I was too lazy to. the flight was delayed slightly and didn&apos;t take off until around 4 am eastern time. I&apos;ve never fallen asleep so easily on a flight.</div><div><br/></div><div>there&apos;s a new developer at the company, a Ben Williams; I never introduced myself to him and probably never will now. work was the same, until Hannah messaged me asking me to dinner because she &quot;been struggling&quot; and &quot;company helps.&quot; I was aware of how quickly I agreed. she ubered to my workplace and I drove her to a restaurant on buford right next to the ice cream place I went to with nita earlier this year. along the way she decided to open up to me (just her latest) and told me that she and John would likely split soon. although I hardly know the guy at all, from what I&apos;ve been hearing her say about him, it wasn&apos;t surprising. yet I was still slightly surprised that this was actually it. that he&apos;s been increasingly distant from her and she isn&apos;t sure if she should just end things herself. I thought of the whole thing as a trial for myself. a test on what to say. I&apos;m sure I know better than I once did; my mind goes back to the time monique confessed that she had fallen in love with a gay guy and I was scrambling. I don&apos;t know what Hannah was expecting from me, if anything; it&apos;s likely she wanted nothing more than someone to talk to and I was the only one Available. I tried to avoid thinking about this as an opportunity.</div><div><br/></div><div>at the restaurant we talked normally and I wasn&apos;t too anxious about anything. the food tasted good so I wasn&apos;t worried about being picky, but I became thirsty towards the end and didn&apos;t ask for water. Hannah paid and I agreed to venmo her later. we went to the ice cream place next door after, mostly on my suggestion, where I ordered the same strawberry thing that I got last time. I showed her the amq wallet I&apos;ve been thinking about buying and she didn&apos;t like that either.</div><div><br/></div><div>the thing that I&apos;m mad about is that she asked me if I&apos;ve ever had a girlfriend before and I gave the same simple no, and augmented it by telling her that I no longer care about revealing that to people. she told me that that&apos;s good because it means I&apos;m growing. I think that was such a stupid thing for me to say, but I said it.</div><div><br/></div><div>I learned that the internship Mallory&apos;s taking on for three months in new york is unpaid. maybe she&apos;ll be miserable up there because she&apos;s working for free and still has to pay rent to stay somewhere. maybe it&apos;ll be what she needs and it&apos;ll end up good. I learned that Jacob doesn&apos;t have much money saved up, and that that&apos;s an issue that they&apos;ve all discussed together.</div><div><br/></div><div>today I asked nita for her opinion, and what she said confirmed to me that I&apos;m sitting on the &quot;emotional tampon&quot; side of things and should stop making myself so available. but also said that if I like Hannah, I should go for her.</div><div><br/></div></div></en-note>      ]]>

<hr/>
; 11-01 thursday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i have more deteriorating relationships than strengthening ones right now. some are in laughable ruin, some are still being swept downstream, struggling to survive, some i've left abandoned to decay, some were shot in the head, and less than a handful still spark. i walk around others in circles, imagining an abbey in place of the warehouse i've managed to build.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday i managed to slip into my giddy, gigglebox self (kind of like hannah, come to think of it) while working with sally and sang. i don't think that usually happens around people i know only as well as they. i named a google spreadsheet &quot;rilayshunul skeema dygrim&quot; to hold our relational schema diagram, and sang just didn't understand.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back in high school i went through a brief phase in which i only had to look v in the face for a moment before bursting out in laughter. tom thought it was hilarious, but v got mildly annoyed after a while, only to seemingly slip into a similar state himself for a couple days. i always feel good when people say i'm weird. i take it as a compliment. sometimes i'll find something funny and no one else can figure out the exact reason i think it's so amusing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the person sitting across the table from me MAY be laughing because i keep intermittently cracking up right now.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ashley was sitting on the big wooden CULC steps with who i suppose is her boyfriend right now and she saw me walking up the stairs but didn't acknowledge me. so i just walked past her. caroline was sitting at the starbucks again. barely glanced at csukas and sanat in psyc class, who never look at me. david was right about me back in the summer, right about the word &quot;love&quot;, that i had no idea what i was saying when i kept tossing it around in those facebook notes. i couldn't imagine going to that halloween party by myself. thoughts about brooke and tyler. things like that that make me know i'm not cut out for that group. that rattles me and reminds me of how far i am from who i want to be, that no, i'm anything but &quot;perfect&quot;. the already infinite distance between me and it seems to expand every time i..look..at it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>is there supposed to be something special about the people with whom i unfold? if there is then it depends on them, then, and not on me. i don't want to need people.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sam, i can't really talk anymore in front of sam anymore. saying hi is already like lifting a cinderblock with my tongue.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>looking at the ACF facebook group posts is starting to more than annoy me, it's starting to piss me off, particularly david, maybe because i'm wondering if he's really done all the things he says he has in the past. actually he probably hasn't lied or even exaggerated much about that, but i feel like the degree to which he's changed from his past self he's told me about is tremendous and he seems a little fake to me all the time, even though i [i]believe[/i] he isn't. i just want to tell some of them to fuck off, more because i know it would shock them than offend them. it would do both though. they're too easily offended. I, CANNOT, BE, MYSELF, AROUND THEM.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>david said that [i]requiem for a dream[/i] was weird. i think he said that twice. what the fuck made you think it was weird, eh? it was so beautiful.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i hope people like my ACF video, because i want to make a good video. i don't care so much about the rest.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>but</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>YOU CAN CHOOSE HAPPINESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>some nights i say fuck it all. wish that could be every night.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sam followed me on tumblr today. he's posted 3 things and hasn't posted anything in almost three months.</div>
<div><br/></div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>last night, in sally's apartment, i kept having laughter attacks while thinking about left 4 dead. i cracked up so hard i couldn't speak while talking about the witch with sang, who's also played the game. neither sally nor sang, or sang's girlfriend diana seemed to find it amusing that i was laughing, so that sucked. i wish i didn't have to use up all of my laughter on them. i can't get myself to laugh at it anymore.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>furthermore our project was a total disaster. i ended up unfocused, spending more time thinking about how cleanly i could have made everything if we had started earlier than thinking clearly about what to do. i just stopped caring this morning, and began playing left 4 dead again while sally and sang wrapped it up, compiled everything, and delivered it to the professor's office.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lisa texted me &quot;Hi&quot;. i had completely forgotten that we were supposed to hang out today. completely. so i had to cancel plans with her too.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i was late to ACF today. steph, tam, monique, and david made eye contact with me as i walked in the room. eyes flew past enoch's. i had missed enoch's prayer message entirely, and everyone was in groups going over discussion questions. the one that the group i sat with was on was something like &quot;why do you pray&quot;. david asked me why i pray. i replied with i don't. and he nodded, seemingly understandingly. i didn't find him annoying at all, and in fact he was still pretty much the only person i felt like talking to. maybe it's only online that i find people especially annoying.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>tam went over his announcements again, saying the exact same things as he's said for the past two fucking months, especially when it came to urbana (&quot;freshman you get to go twice&quot;). i haven't registered for urbana and i won't. i wonder what i'll be missing out on. i've been worried about missing on good music, music by artists out there in the wild unknown to me, and here is a big opportunity that's all up in my face every week and i'm flatly saying no every time i'm reminded of it. how can god not exist if so many people gather in such a setting for him?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>jennifer ha came up to me, addressing me as &quot;you&quot;. according to her she's seen me at the CULC several times and said i never wave to her. christina referenced my small group application again. i have never noticed jennifer ha at the CULC.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i still don't understand kelly. i'd label her poisonous, but that wouldn't be nice, because she's probably not like that at heart. she came up to me several times tonight though, and i always find it strange when she focuses her attention on me, no matter how briefly, because we usually don't notice each other. she asked me about something she drew on a small pumpkin. i correctly identified a small blob as cinderella's slipper, something which other people apparently thought was &quot;the mouse&quot;. then after dinner when steph ran up to me chanting &quot;sweet hut sweet hut&quot; kelly ran up to me for a second too. then while we were at sweet hut she asked me several random questions with christina, monique, and the super-asian looking girl with the weirdly shaped face. she also texted me just now claiming to hope i &quot;had fun tonight!&quot;</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>during dinner at don quixote tonight monique was gone again. we were sitting at the same table, and she was talking a lot and thus eating slowly, and every time i pointed out to her how little she had eaten she seemed annoyed. she also almost never looked at me. i ordered the same dish i had ordered the previous two times i had eaten here and was able to eat it all quite easily which was slightly weird because usually i can barely finish it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i made one attempt to look at mike's face and laugh, trying to induce the weird laughter onset that made me crack up looking at v's face that one time in high school. it didn't work, and i didn't want to try again.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>david told us about how he picked up steph and then farted, and that it was the first time he had farted in front of her. allison went all &quot;aaawwww&quot;. fucking ay.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sweet hut is a small asian cafe/bakery filled with bubble tea and the like. it was packed, with of course almost all asians. i already mentioned that kelly, christina, monique, and the weird-faced asian girl leaned up towards me from across the table and asked me questions like what is your favorite color and would you rather fart blue smoke or sweat green liquid. it was stupid.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>not hanging out with them again. no one knew for sure what everyone's doing, but i'd rather play left 4 dead. by myself.</div>

<div>no, i didn't see anjaly yesterday. and now she's still unwilling to let me read what she wrote. well not exactly, she just doesn't want me to keep it. wonder what's going on..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today i saw sidney at target. i say hi now. i don't just wave and smile, i just say hi. i don't say the person's name. another terrible, terrible hug. then her mother showed up. and then her stepdad. we didn't really talk. i passed her parents a second time while walking down a different aisle and pretended to not notice them. and then i saw them all a third time at the checkout counter, and pretended to not notice them again. i'm worse than i ever thought.</div>

<div>i can't keep up with this 750 words a day thing anymore.</div>

<div>it occurred to me that when i laugh at something that seems random to everyone i'm behaving similarly to the way calvin did back when i knew him, laughing at things the rest of us could never understand.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i checked out a couple pictures of lisa at some halloween party. she's a little fat, slightly chubby, i thought, and then thought lol. she reeks. thinking about her, the sight of her, reeks strongly of..her. it's an attitude, a vantage point, of mine that i can't describe to an outsider. i don't like the way she smells. i just texted her asking to hang out again, mostly because i don't want to be one of them. a deserter. i can't believe i used to care. remember the first time she texted me early in a morning? i was half hoping it would simply be a good morning text. how disgusting.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>anjaly wants to talk to me concerning the things i write. at least she likes it. this time she apparently didn't have any word count in mind and wrote down what appears to be a stream of consciousness around a big drawing possibly of a flower. that she wants returned to her. i don't even want to read it.</div>

<div>i think my relationships with tom and asta are hopelessly lost. there's no longer any catching-up to do. what would we talk about? we would find ourselves strangers. we don't want each other's company anymore. i'm not going to make any effort to contact them anymore. even asta, who i've said this about so many times. the distance between us is un-bridge-able now. sorry. it's lost.</div>

<div>i haven't talked to melissa since we last hung out. i wonder if she's noticed, because i haven't. i don't feel like speaking to her either. i was curled up so uncomfortably tightly in my shell when i was with her.</div>

<div>i called home yesterday but they were at tracy's house, mother said when i dialed her cell. brother wasn't there so i couldn't say happy birthday to him directly. talking to my mother made me feel sad. talking to anyone in my family makes me feel sad. i feel so apart from them. and it's then that i realized i'm worried about missing out on all the wrong things.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sometimes i miss the old, bad, shitty times. i don't wish i had had more of them, just that i had paid more attention. there are other, more pleasant times that i also wish i had paid more attention to and that i do wish i had more of. i heard lillian's voice in the video i took at six flags of the groundhog eating from a trash can, and for a moment i almost missed her, and all of my high school summers.</div>

<div>kelly texted me again today an unprompted well-meaning message. i just don't get her. she said she would pray for me and my interview. i wasn't nervous for my interview, but i wasn't confident either, i told her. i wasn't nervous for my interview, but i wasn't confident either. i don't even get nervous anymore. whatever will happen will happen.</div>

<div>in psyc class today i sat next to a hipster person who was being extraordinarily negative with thoughts that he kept muttering under his breath and apparently wasn't bothering to keep to himself. he was getting on my nerves and i was imagining all the things i wanted to say to him to tell him off and picturing beating him to a pulp until i realized that i have thought, and probably still think, many similarly derogative things. i thought to myself, oh no! so to make a conscious effort to reaccept everybody who i've recently rejected, i'll keep him in mind.</div>

<div>&quot;Small group?&quot; david texts me. i ignored him. i might just never go back. maybe if i do his room will make me sick. if he asks me why i don't come to small group anymore (and he'll probably drawl) i think i'll tell him &quot;because i don't want to waste two hours of unfulfilling time silently listening to things i don't believe in surrounded by people who annoy me.&quot; no, of course i won't say that. that's what i want to say.</div>

<div>whenever i think of ralf i think of the moment by the montjuïc fountain when he offered me a cigarette by wordlessly holding out his pack in front of me. we had almost become friends, during the several nights we'd spent lounging and smoking outside different bars. what comes to my mind is a ringleader-type caricature with which the main character of some movie develops a dangerously close relationship that ends up harming another facet of his life. like a drug lord, or something. i can't think of any specific movie right now.</div>

<div>anjaly, she jerks me back to the reality in which i'm nothing particularly special after all, in which i'm dreadfully, dreadfully awake.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>:gap:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>walking with talking with anjaly, if you were to ask me, i'd say it's what i've wanted for a long time. at the same time, i'm glad i didn't get excited over it, because if i had, i would've been drastically disappointed. and why was i not excited? i have been in the past. all that comes to mind is kelly right now. why does anjaly seem so promising while kelly is extinct? i don't know. anjaly seems more genuine in every way. in that regard i really hope she doesn't end up disappointing. she peppered me with questions again, the kind that i swear would completely fail as conversation boosters if i were to try them on anyone else, in between longish stretches of not quite so awkward, but loud, silences. she still says she likes my writing because it reminds her of herself, and i still don't understand that. she said she had written a story when she was in middle school. it was about the last 8 minutes before the sun exploded, a time by which humans had advanced far enough to be able to evacuate the planet. one person however becomes distracted by something trivial and doesn't make it. we sat on the ledge on the skiles building, somewhere i had never been before. we didn't look at each other a lot. she said the idea of an afterlife doesn't make any sense to her, if our consciousnesses are nothing more than a byproduct of physics and chemistry. i almost wanted to argue against it. maybe that means i believe in god, if just a tiny bit. i brought that up as a topic too. i was telling her about the 30-second philosophy book i'd skimmed and the theories that dealt with religion. as soon as i said the word &quot;religion&quot; i felt disgusted. i said another line about the theories arguing that god actually does exist, and i felt disgusting after saying those words too. i was immediately sorry i brought it up. even anjaly herself dismissed the topic. i lent her 3 of my books to read. we hugged before she left. i hope we keep hugging but don't want it to become the way it was with melanie. she doesn't want to be in a relationship, because she doesn't want to become &quot;significant&quot; to anyone. well too late, you're already important to me. suddenly though the thought of being alone seems a tiny bit less aversive. yes i have to restrain myself heavily around her, and while she's a promising candidate, i found that i was forcing myself a little too hard at times. well. on to the next moment.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>her four questions are panic fear when was the last time i cried what do i want from my friends</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we'll start with the last one. no, the third, because that can be summed up in one word. it was also basically the only time i've cried.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my biggest fear(s), immediately, would be something cliché like staying the way i am right now. i'll work on it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>panic? realizing that i had hurt someone.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>as for friends, let's first round the names up. asta, v, tom. then the few strange people who i'm somehow able to unlock myself around, like lee (restored), urvashi and sam eller. maybe tyler too. the ACF people, are the ones i have to shackle myself around. i don't think they would be able to handle me. fuck them. they're nice people, all of them. there's nothing inherently Wrong with them. they just frustrate me so much. i think i need to quit ranting about them though. i just needed to say that they're still nice people.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>sometimes i can't wait until i get to leave this world, but i always forget to think about where i'd go next anyway. who says it'll be someplace better. it gets terrifying.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm not falling in love with her, and i hope i won't. haha, it seems i've trained myself well.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>asta, trying to ask how i'm doing. again. feels less and less sincere.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>when asking me to hang out anj asked if i wanted to &quot;play.&quot; she said she likes to &quot;play&quot; with people, instead of getting (letting herself?) become too close to them.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>just because i fit in somewhere easily, does it mean i belong there? maybe i don't actually fit in there. just the sight of Anna Mazzolini's name confirmed to be that no, i don't belong with the barcelona-esque group either.</div>

<div>you know last night i was thinking i'd just try to act happy at ACF today, and smile and talk to david and people, but i'm feeling less inclined now.</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
; 11-11 sunday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>here follows the account of last friday evening:</div>
<div>i told v that i don't pray anymore. we couldn't discuss it because i had to leave early for ACF, but i think he'd genuinely want to talk about it with me. our beliefs were something we just about never touched upon. he never struck me as a religious type of person. markedly different from the ACF people here.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so i leave earlier than i usually bother, because i want to ask enoch to take a video of everyone while they're praying. i actually forgot that tonight was &quot;praise and prayer night&quot; and then a little later remembered that emory people would be coming. i don't really want to be there. everyone's gathered outside the room and kelly makes an attempt to talk to me and quickly aborts. i want to tell jack to shut the fuck up. mike still has his airy obliviousness i can almost see and feel. i ask him to take the video instead, and he agrees. i sit alone on the side of the room opposite to where everyone else mingles. it occurs to me that i make myself too cold and unapproachable. enoch comes over and asks me stupid questions, like how was my week, what do i do in my spare time, inquiring in a slow deliberate way that usually used to ask more sincere questions, nodding slowly before excusing himself. christina, yan, and jennifer ha sit down by me for a minute before getting up and running off in a manner that make me think of a pet dog, who gives you its attention for a brief moment before running away just as you start to think it likes you. i felt no desire whatsoever to try to talk to any of the emory people. i saw one nametag though, Dallas. i thought it was funny because i remember him at the emerge retreat earlier this year, and the way he yelled his name out loud when he hit the volleyball while we were playing volleyball in a circle with the rule that you have to to shout your name whenever you hit the ball. the worship starts, and i don't sing and get bored. there are sticky notes and pens in the back of the room, for people to write prayers on. i'm planning to write a prayer for v, take my phone back after mike takes his video, and discretely leave while everyone has their heads bowed. jonathan yip, i think that's his name, the guy who i saw at the birthday dinner a couple of weeks ago, whose friend request i deleted, pats me on the shoulder. the prayer topics presented by the emory leaders seem weak and insincere. i don't know what i would have said had i bothered praying. during one prayer session we are told to place an arm on anyone we want to pray for. i was surprised, when i felt one land on my shoulder, and turned to see josé standing next to me. he squeezed it before leaving, and i watched him return to where he had been standing, where i couldn't see him. david arrived late, and during one of the worship songs, walks over and stands next to me. kelly saw, and she smiled. i ended up staying for the entire duration of the night, even after mike took the video and i wrote my prayer. i still didn't want to eat dinner with them though, and helen fucking overheard as i told david i'm going home. so i left while everyone else moved the tables back.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the next day, as i was walking to target, i heard YAN, of all fucking people, yell out my name and i saw her driving by. i'm guessing it was jennifer ha in the passenger seat. she yelled &quot;we love you!&quot; and i was too surprised to say anything.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>time always becomes warped during the weekends. it's on the weekends that i feel emptiest, like a balloon drifting through space. i texted anjaly asking if she's read any of the books i lent her. i might try writing a poem. the weekend twists me, strains and pulls me, and my eyes stare blankly as my mind dumps everything i know.</div>

<div>well i bumped into dan fitzgerald while walking back to my dorm. he asked me questions about how things have been, and i asked him none. i told him onix is the most memorable part of the barcelona trip to me. nothing really important. stupid conversation, really. he jogs quickly. i would so not have been able to keep up.</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>i played with anjaly again yesterday. i'm starting to enjoy it. here are some of the things i told her. i told her about asta. the last time i cried was over a girl, her, and she said she couldn't even fathom feeling that sad over a guy. she knows who steph is, when i told her that i had a big crush on steph up until about 7 months ago. she's dating that white guy now, isn't she? yes, she is. i'm not the least bit attracted to her anymore. i don't feel about asta the way i used to. i said we talk occasionally, but it's more like rarely. i forgot how the pain had become, for a time, a physical ache i could feel in my chest. anjaly said she becomes guarded, and doesn't let anyone in that way. i've become like that too, and maybe that's why talking with her is becoming easy because i'm not worried about falling into another one of my own traps. she helped with that by telling me she doesn't want a relationship, and by knocking the remotest possibility of that happening, fantasizing about it has become easier and less guilty. we sat at a picnic table in the little courtyard somewhere in the middle of west campus, and started ripping up leaves. she said ripping things calms her. she talked about guys in the past and some vague emotion things that i couldn't understand. she asked me what i'm thinking about several times. it was quiet when we walked. i decided to go to mcdonald's with a group of her friends. ethan's always mildly excited to see me. she pointed out a small warehouse industrial-y area that she said she likes to hang out in, i immediately thought about how the first thing i imagine ACF people would say would be about how &quot;sketchy&quot; or &quot;creepy&quot; it looked, and it started to piss me off and make me feel superior to them because i think i'd enjoy sitting there. i gave her my tumblr url. i had a somewhat funny time at mcdonald's and didn't really talk to her friends that much. i was undeniably happy because she kept talking to me, and nudging me whenever i'd say something slightly uncensored to ethan about things, but i'm less worried because the gesture is less special. ethan and me stayed behind with her because she had texts to send before midnight, but when we got back to sixth street she found that she had left her purse behind and i sort of offered to go back with her, but she sort of dismissed me, sounding tired, so i just walked home. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this particular memory stands out</div>
<div>just for now</div>
<div>a wasteful spot</div>
<div>it's me, filling a cup with water from a pitcher</div>
<div>pretending to be unaware of where i was</div>
<div>when in fact the textures made me sore</div>
<div>the people made me sick</div>
<div>it makes me know what sick to my stomach means</div>
<div>everybody else is so oblivious. it's exhausting to act like i Know where i am</div>
<div>when i wished i did, but just wanted to leave..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i pour from a pitcher water into a cup</div>
<div>the room gives me nausea</div>
<div>i'm stuck with their voices</div>
<div>i can't look at the lights</div>
<div>i know what sick to my stomach means</div>

<div>i want to be like lsdemon. i wish i could have sex and do drugs. i talked with lisa a bit today. she was wearing short shorts and i thought i wouldn't mind having sex with her if she wouldn't mind. being drunk fucks me up.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>:gap:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so i drank again last night, after lisa told me that she goes to bed at 4:30 am. basically decided fuck it, and played L4D2 until past 6 am, drunk. woke up at 1:26 pm. i've been feeling slightly nauseated and my heart is still thumping hard. i think i drank almost half of the bottle of rum last night. it tasted nasty. lisa said she would text me. this state of mind is so strange.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>if i could ask lisa for a hug now, i would. if anjaly was sitting next to me talking, i'd rest my head on her shoulder. ideally, i'd have a comfy armchair i could sit naked in, and nobody would know or care. also i'd be a girl, because that's just another thing i want that i can't have. i'm sitting at the tables outside the CULC right now and i wish i could take a nap..but i'm too afraid. i still use two dots instead of three only because that's what tiffany used to do. i hope i can read just the first couple of sentences and remind myself of how i'm feeling now. cuddly. and that i wouldn't be scared to just touch her, because that's no longer a gesture that i tie knots with.</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>david didn't pray either, before eating. he didn't mention it. few people have been going to small group. christina hasn't been there.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>was i in touch with my subconscious on a slightly different level? like there is an attractive girl sitting across from me right now, and i want to stare at her. the more i look the familiar she looks.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i can no longer focus worth shit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm slowly doing away with the idea that anything between me and anjaly is remotely special. clearly i'm not to her. i just think telling her things i've never told anyone else is fun. yes, i'm still afraid. a little. i don't have any secrets. there's nothing worth keeping, and telling her just makes everything sillier.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>:gap:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i would have forgotten to go to small group today if david hadn't texted me. i almost think this is god talking to me. this is what ACF has done to me. i feel corrupted now. skewed. uncertain, fearful, over the possibility that everything they say about god and hell is true. i think i would rather believe that once i die, and all the physics and chemistry behind my consciousness and self-perception stop working, that i'll cease existing for good. why do we have orgasms? this life is so fucking empty. in accountability that's supposed to be inherent in the small groups just doesn't work. kelly tried to say hi to me. fuck me. nobody cared, that i was there (except david). they all forgot their &quot;applications&quot;, either that or they didn't bother enforcing them, and their new ones for this week were all vague again. hannah launched into a frustrated rant, and in the middle of the meeting kelly played (presumably) draw something. i'm not going to sign up for this next semester.</div>

<hr/>
; 11-17 saturday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>here i am. s bux. just as i promised.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a plethora of things</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it's always disappointing when...</div>
<div>i hear my name called and i turn only to see it's from someone like gabe. an acquaintance, nothing more.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm not sure why i didn't go to ACF yesterday. i'm also not sure if i was or wasn't disappointed when no one asked me where i was. mike texted me at about 1:30 in the morning, so they were probably all hanging out.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my self-concept is crumbling. i'm too different around different people, sometimes adapting a single personality just for one specific person, that i'm no longer sure which one is the real me. it used to be the way i was around ACF, or so i thought. then i decided i felt freer in bcn. then there are people like v, asta, and anjaly, each of whom are now different.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i feel no real inclination to talk to or hang out with any of the bcn kids now either. it still doesn't feel completely normal to see a post from one of them show up on facebook. like it's not the default type of post. they're not my default group of friends. that designation still goes to ACF, and i'm becoming disgusted at it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i only talked to patrick because he's the one thread i have left. and mighty fucking thin one at that. i asked him to hang out, sounding insincere.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i walked down a short flight of five or so steps outside and glanced the contour of a girl's shirt shaping around her breasts and i'm reminded of &quot;reality&quot;. scenes flash through my mind, experiences i've never been through, that terrify me nonetheless, because i know i can't handle that side of the world on my own successfully...</div>
<div>that my daydreams are laughably beyond my reach.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i used to do that &quot;fall in love in ten seconds&quot; thing where i stare at someone attractive and imagine a newborn, alternate life with her. we would hug and kiss. reminisce, or stare at something natural like the sky or the stars. it'd be somewhere natural like the beach or on a hill or up in the fucking mountains. we'd somehow be able to share something that only i think i have.</div>
<div>this doesn't work anymore. i don't know why i'm suddenly so tired of it. do i even want it? what i want is a girlfriend, although i really don't want to call it that. i think it's more special and unspoken. but there's really not much to it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i think it's time i treat this timeline as the sole universe in existence. i don't even believe in god, but that gives me nobody to thank. i like to think of a heaven or an afterlife, whenever i want to fuck the world, but i imagine it in such little detail. if i don't disappear when i die, why should the place i hypothetically go next be any better? whether or not it is to be heaven or hell. maybe it's better if i plan for an absolute end, when i die. my self never really existed, it was all just atoms and shit. and the chemical reactions will all just stop.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm afraid that anjaly doesn't care for talking with me anymore. i wonder how much she hides from me. am i just another toy? will she get of playing with me eventually. maybe i should just be her.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>everything i have in my life is going. i'm pushing away the only friends i have. unwilling to choose alternatives because it's so exhausting. i haven't been wasting time reading the tech blogs i always do.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i don't want to be an asshole.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>people look like they're alone, but they're always just waiting for someone. someone always comes. and you're still the only one.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i wonder what i'll say to the usual family crowd come thanksgiving. i can't imagine caring. if alex is there i'll probably start swearing a lot. i might just swear a lot because i've had to contain myself for so long here. it wouldn't be fun getting drunk from wine when i'm around them.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>working with jenni and brandon on the psyc project was miserably pathetic. i've never felt a greater sense of aimlessness among partners. we were so incohesive, and for this particular project it didn't really matter for shit, but it was almost funny how shitty it was. buying a $5 roll of tape for our stupid poster. i kept looking down jenni's shirt.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>mike is an airhead. he always stares into the distance, so much that when he makes eye contact during a conversation, it feels weird. spaced out. airy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i continue to ignore sam when he says hi or bye when he leaves the room.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
; 11-19 monday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we reached a record high yesterday on the grocery shuttle where there were three other people i know. the barrier between rita and i was so tangible. then kevin li and gabe got on the bus. i know they don't like each other, and wondered if they interacted at the bus stop. they sat far apart. kevin's voice is deep, rough, and quiet. the sound of one that doesn't get used much. i'm worried that my voice sounds like his, and i know it probably does. he has the same long hair that he keeps tossing back. a stupid facial expression that looks like he's constantly jumping around conversational blocks. disgusting.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it struck me that i really don't want to go home. mother told me that my brother's been sleeping in my bed and asked me if i wanted to sleep in the guest bedroom. fuck no? when i think about my house it feels less like home than ever. i picture my bedroom in my head and it feels foreign, and empty. just a temporary residence space, more temporary than my dorm at school. my dresser, closet, and bookshelf are full of things i haven't touched in years. i leave the clothes i bring home in a heap on the floor. everything feels a mess. i can't wait to get out. it's really quite sad. i'm not sure where i feel more miserable.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the person sitting next to me is glancing all over the place eating a starbucks sandwich. he looks so fucking clueless. is that how i look when i decide to get a sandwich? fuck me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ethan saw me too but didn't come over to talk to me. he usually does, even when i didn't expect him to. now that i waited for him for once, he didn't.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this place is so noisy, and i never, ever, get to contribute to the noise.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i get worried and frightened thinking about how much people control and twist themselves when they're around and talking to me. do i really know anybody? just as i adopt a certain personality around different people, what do they do around me?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm a depressant</div>
<div>a poison</div>
<div>a problem</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
; 11-20 tuesday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>there is a picture of anjaly online (on her facebook), of her at some gt china care event cradling a small child in her arm with another beside her. i'm stricken by it. i wish, so hard, in that instant, to be her.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this peppermint mocha is too bitter so i'm going to leave it here.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>david gave me yet another reality check yesterday. he pointed out things about me that i genuinely was not aware of, and maybe still don't entirely believe. i only act sad because i want to, he says, and i can be happier if i just relax. he called my depressive tumblr &quot;silly&quot;. that alone made me want to quit tumblr. blogging, reblogging, and posting was never a true habit, so i'll probably just quit posting things on there from here on.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm skipping math tomorrow, and going straight from my room to the airport. i'm far, far less excited than i was last year. this time i have what actually staying back at home will be like, and...i'm not looking forward to it. how will i repair my relationship with my family? let's be real and stop fucking fantasizing. i've been dreaming for a very long time, and i truly never realized it. time to start saying yes...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
; 11-22 thursday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm at &quot;home&quot;. and feeling kind of lost. dad picked me up from the airport, and we didn't talk much on the drive back, except for about job matters. i felt a mixture of pain and resignation. he kept turning the radio off and on again. it was playing christmas music already, and it wasn't even thanksgiving day yet. the house feels empty, and it's a total mess. the floor is cold. the shower head sucks. i almost feel like i'm staying at a hotel. nothing is in its right place. for the first time i'm nearly dreading the 3-week stay i'll be having here over winter break. david posted a picture of his thanksgiving table, a very big authentic-looking one. i bet he'll be having a nice time. i guess i should make the most of the people i'll be seeing at our own thanksgiving party today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now today is thanksgiving, and i woke up at 1:30 pm. there's nothing special about today. i noticed a new house has been built next door where that old one had been torn down. it's much bigger than the old one.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
; 11-27 tuesday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>what a joke. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today i saw her again. she was looking in my direction. i cautiously looked in hers. she was already walking with someone. she spotted something. me? i waited for her to recognize me. but she called out another name (a girl's name). she (the girl) must have been walking behind me. i kept going after that. i'm afraid that she ignored me. i feel the fear taking root and growing in me. i'm longing and waiting for her to dispel it. my heart raced (a little bit) when i noticed her. when that happens...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the first person i talked to was jonathan pham. what we talked about: secret santa. he kept mishearing me say the word &quot;exchanging&quot;. i realized we'll probably never know who our secret santas are. partying and clubbing. he was &quot;gone&quot; in beijing, he said. long island iced tea. he said i'm more talkative now than i was when we roomed together last year.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>michelle's small face.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm thinking about kissing everybody i know (girls).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
; 11-30 friday<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lazy. it's all spiraling out of control, rolling downhill. i now mildly detest the idea of sitting at the CULC typing out thoughts i think are important somehow. i don't think i'm going to copy everything i wrote into evernote anymore. i will try to start writing in a real notebook. meanwhile i'll leave my tumblr to rot.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>anjaly said she feels bad that she keeps ditching. semi-invited me over to &quot;study&quot;, but just think about packing up my macbook air and walking outside with my backpack on, to be greeted by her and guided up the sixth street elevator to her room where (as she had cautioned ahead of time) we wouldn't even be talking and i would be miserably doing nothing on the macbook air. no thanks.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>there are peer evaluations to be done for cs4911, but today's meeting didn't manifest any hostility towards me (or sam) for our complete lack of effort (on my part) on the stupid project. sam expressed relief at that afterwards, which surprised me. he asked me about the peer evaluations too. tomorrow i will present, talk for perhaps no more than thirty seconds and this will all be over.</div>

<div>Talking with Krista is always so hopelessly awkward.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Whenever I see a grey honda accord, I immediately think of David, and Steph by extension. Occasionally, it is he/them.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this culture that I am doomed to remain forever detached from</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I’m tired of trying to insert myself into conversations. from now on I won’t bother.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>beginning to dislike telling white lies.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the door phenomenon. this had been observed several times for a week. recognized individuals would pass, reach a door first, and slip through with no regard for me, presumably with the intent of avoiding eye contact with me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>stranger encounters: the man on his way to the airport, two people at the publix trolley stop asking when the bus would come, and a very kind customer service representative.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last week i thought that monique’s small group meeting reminded me of the older days. yesterday I went a little further back in time, when I heard myself pray out loud for the first time in x years. it was magical, and a little frightening to hear my voice saying the short thing that I said. I thought about Diana commenting on how sincere my prayers once were, and that was all that I was concerned with.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Nica.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Louisa’s story.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>They strangely gave us a tour, which I didn’t understand, or care about. I didn’t recognize anybody there except Steph’s friend and the girl Beatrice. The worship was meaningless.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>People said they never see me with shorts.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I didn’t say a thing to Enoch again. Imagine if he’s ignoring me too. If that’s the case, then I noticed.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>narrow.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>First, make sure you are not a disgusting human.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Imagine normal conversations with normal girls. Why is this template so impossible to fit in?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Just refused an offer to go to church. Social complaints negated.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>“I can’t remember his name.”</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>“You know today, Woody’s was really good.”</div>
<div>“What’d they have?”</div>
<div>“They had General Tso’s chicken…”</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>“Do you have the dry cleaning back?”</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>“She said, she’s been having foot (?) problems, and, the doctor…”</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>people on Facebook during the messaging.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Emily’s fingers</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I still don’t know what Jennifer’s voice sounds like…</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I paid for myself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And there it was, a revelation that went totally unrealized.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Cynthia looks Korean now.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Steph put her hand to my shoulder, just like she used to.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>“Lourdes” and her question.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>“Rachel”</div>
<div><br/></div>

<div>Oh my god, have you not seen finding nemo?</div>
<div>I have!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I don’t know what to do. I’m not there to punch him in the face.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>smiling at katherina, kevin,</div>
<div><br/></div>
so Rochelle is freshman.
<div><br/></div>
<div><span style="-evernote-last-insertion-point:true;"/>my prayers are no longer sincere. and some things learned about Yan and Christina…</div>

<en-note style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><div>My ears are ringing like no tomorrow. Tonight was one of the most confusing nights in my life, comparable to what had transpired in BCN. Unreal. I’m so unable to decipher the behavior of even normal people. I was tipsy after a single drink, sobered up fast, drank one more, and stopped there. Others drank far more than they should have. The JB is one stupid strange motherfucker, and I found myself gravitating toward him even though he treated me like shit. I don’t think he should be a problem. The Tim gave me some pieces of…advice. This is not the first time this has happened. The Rob was fairly normal. I guess the girls were like me in a way, not knowing what to make of all the guys’ behavior. The Tim still knew the JB was immature. I’m just wondering what I’m missing, and I’m willing to venture into danger to find out. I need to find more opportunities like this. I had gotten the “Korrie” name completely wrong, unless she put that down on purpose? It’s actually Kelsey. The JB noticed her too. he is seriously absurd, complete douche from head to toe. I’m afraid because it’s people like him who are a force to reckon with. Prior to consumption, I was becoming really sad and worried that I simply won’t ever break through this barrier, but it’s still fixable. I know that. I need to keep trying, with energy that is only found within me, need to tap it somehow. Dwelling in the mud is dangerously depressing and solves no problems; I must not remain there for any reason. Remind myself, Dan, you are you, I am me, and we must do this together. I do not know the world. I have to meet it. Goddamn it.</div><div><br/></div><div>I mean is this what I need or isn’t it? should be diving into this water or continue avoiding it? what is it that I need??? I am so completely sad and confused. at a dead end. don’t know if I can make it, don’t know if I will ever make it out of here. Inadequate and completely incapable of being a normal human being.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
my ears were ringing like there was no tomorrow. throughout the entire night I just felt confused as hell. I pretty much never join this scene, and it's appalling to think that it's a normal, routine thing for some people. events and places that were always outliers in my head...are in fact prototypical. the only outlier is me.</div><div><br/></div><div>don't worry about people who are unabashed assholes from head to toe. this guy was unbelievable, even surpassing my barcelona roommate. I people like him come to be. the way he talked about women, his utter disrespect, the stupid slang he used so casually. they actually exist. I've never met anyone who made me feel so bad about myself. and why did I keep following him around? there's nothing to figure out.</div><div><br/></div><div>then some people got themselves nearly wasted...we were at a sports bar, filled with a crowd of mostly strangers. why do you spend $50 on drinks here? one guy next to me was drunk enough so that he just scrawled a wavy line on his bar tab receipt. another tried to be a wingman or something, telling girls that I'm a nice guy because he was trying to get me laid. yes that was very thoughtful of him.</div><div><br/></div><div>hard code this: any attempt to explicitly modify my core behavior will not be successful.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

11-9
<div><br/></div><div>so i would declare today  semi-successful day, but i won't be making progress reports for every character. i'll just say that there are some very awkward adults that come out to these meetups. then there's the girl who calls herself T. and [the] Angie's selfie with me. i need to be honest with mysel, i'm consciously ignoring my hopefulness that is interpreting their every action towards me as a sign that they like me. at least i know that would be stupid.</div><div><br/></div><div>that guy Lucas, asking me questions and then staring off into space. [the] Fredy remembering me. the dorky guy who seems quite cool, actually. weird seeing those adults like they do. i assume that they're toning themselves down for me, but no, that appears to be their default setting.</div><div><br/></div><div>honestly the best part of the day was when the sky trail girl was hooking my harness up. several contacts and my whole body was tingling.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
11-11 t</div><div><br/></div><div>missed 11:11 both times today.</div><div><br/></div><div>everyone claims to be familiar with the &quot;lonely in a crowd&quot; feeling, but being lonely alone is definitely far worse. it's the quiet, the dead, empty silence, that weighs on me and puts the immense pressure on my chest. it's beginning to physically hurt. my imagination is now burdened with the added task of wondering what is going on outside. and it tends to create unpleasant thoughts.</div><div><br/></div><div>today was a rare instance of going out to a meetup on a weekday. the trivia night at the bar was just frustrating. i'm becoming familiar with some of the people in the group, but my shields are still on way too strong, and lord knows there's no manual override for them. if the time ever comes, they deactivate automatically.</div><div><br/></div><div>i barely opened my mouth at all, and when i did it was only to talk to the Angie. i know absolutely nothing about the rock and roll questions they asked, which made me feel uncultured and ever more alienated from the rest of them, as they all chattered away... this one really pretty girl with her boyfriend and another couple-friends and it was so difficult to not turn around to glance at her (pretty sure she still caught me - more than once) and i loathed myself for this and felt intensely frustrated. and pathetic, sitting at the table in my non-matching clothes and wondering when it was all going to end. to escape. <u>this can no longer continue to be an executable option.</u></div><div><u><br/></u></div><div>met an awkward newcomer coworker at lunch. he didn't finish his food and kept his hands in his lap the whole time. very quiet. didn't laugh at jokes, was probably not yet comfortable enough to. just how much better am i, really?</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
11-15 s</div><div><br/></div><div>the guy 'mi-mister' has been following my blog closely. it's a little bit strange. turns out he's an old dude. sent me a message inviting me to open up to him. i'm not prepared.</div><div><br/></div><div>i went on facebook and saw that david, steph, alex, monique, and even ritchie had all gone on a hiking trip together. it hurt, but i can't take these exclusions personally.</div><div><br/></div><div>i wonder what people like david have told their friends about me.</div><div><br/></div><div>it's still an immature thing to be pushing people away. especially if i were to do it with monique.</div><div><br/></div><div>when i find myself talking to strangers...i feel like the way i perceive ritchie. i hate that.</div><div><br/></div><div>IF i actually get to spend time with monique, i should: offer to buy her a drink, if applicable; ask her warmly about her hiking trip; remain cool and easy throughout.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
11-16 n</div><div><br/></div><div>wonder why the Angie chose to spend her birthday the way she did.</div><div><br/></div><div>the lonely have a strong scent about them, a distinct aura that makes them easily detectable. only, i can't sniff out my own. what do i smell like? i'm worried. try to mask mine with a typical smile.</div><div><br/></div><div>my heart rattles for you.</div><div><br/></div><div>often people turn out to not be as intimidating as i initially think. i still distinctly click with certain types of people much better than others. what are the optimal traits? sharpen my own. become comfortable with my own face. me and i are one. and we will do this together.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
the next day</div><div><br/></div><div>i woke up this morning thinking about morgan neems. and wishing that i had kissed her at that dance, six summers ago. lord knows where that would have branched to.</div><div><br/></div><div>monique and i have decided to meet at Dr. Bombay's Underwater Tea Party on wednesday. let's see what happens.</div><div><br/></div><div>i had lunch with my coworker today. i am hilariously awful at talking to him.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
11-18 t</div><div><br/></div><div>one of the women at the UPS store liked my cat hoodie. it made me happy. i told her where she could find it but swallowed while doing so.</div><div><br/></div><div>i want to say that tonight ended with a positive vibe, and i hope it did. the girl Korrie [error] at least looked at me a few times and said some small snippets. i also met a jason, who was cool. i clicked the good-to-see-you button for both of them. who will i see again?</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
11-19 w</div><div><br/></div><div>where do i begin?</div><div><br/></div><div>shame was one of the emotions i correctly identified in that empathy quiz i took yesterday. and it's been steeping in me just like that cup of blueberry green tea i bought for five dollars at Dr. Bombay's. i arrived at least an hour later than expected, given that there was no new set time. but i'd decided to stop at ikea beforehand and even casually texted monique about it as though it were no big deal. basically offhandedly announcing to her that she was not important enough to come first. who do you think she'd told about me? her sister? her mother? the cashier at the counter? i've become one of the people you get hurt by and quickly learn to dismiss. serious reevaluation is required.</div><div><br/></div><div>i really upset her, and knowing that i inflicted this on someone makes me feel extremely guilty. that's probably the one emotion i can't handle. she flatly pointed out how inconsiderate i had been, and realizing that almost made me cry.</div><div><br/></div><div>and i just treated it like a test, not worrying in the slightest about other people overhearing, only on whether or not i had said and done all that i could. i think i did.</div><div><br/></div><div>i wonder if she could tell how terrible i felt, and if she felt guilty at all in turn.</div><div><br/></div><div>in any case, tonight was the scene of a lot of destruction.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
the next day</div><div><br/></div><div>feeling incomplete again. i don't want to say that i have mild depression, but i am so constantly drained. who wants to read that? i am so tired of smiling and want to remove &quot;smile&quot; from my vocabulary. it's okay to feel this way. and i am not okay with that. so fucking fix it!</div><div><br/></div><div>i doubt monique will invite me to the movie this weekend. i'm pretty sure she wouldn't have mentioned it, had i not brought it up. she asked me how work was. i told her i was unproductive, unmotivated, and had been going late. it wasn't particularly engaging material, and was horribly presented. funny how i am dying to pour out all of my feelings if someone would just ask, and in the obscenely rare event that someone does, i choke on my words and hastily wrap every thing up as quickly as i can. i feel like i have no right to tell people about my problems. selfishly burdening them. i don't deserve them.</div><div><br/></div><div>i too live alone, in a heavily edited space that i'm certain will never be shared with a single other soul. i hope i am just a few years late, going through a stage that most have already graduated from. i have no time for God. there is direction in the universe, but i refuse to recognize it as God. maybe i spent college surrounded with the incorrect people. i realize i have.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
11-21 f</div><div><br/></div><div>so the focus of the night was clearly on the JB. you can imagine how he'd react if he found out that i'm writing about him.</div><div><br/></div><div>i'm pretty sure i shouldn't be taking him seriously at all. he is after all perhaps the most insincere person i've met. rivaling, and possibly even topping eddy ahuja. yet i stayed near him because i thought i still could potentially learn things from him. despite his total disrespect and that i'm an easy target for him. he's a shark and i'm a minnow.</div><div><br/></div><div>some things he did bring to light: that i seemed extremely uncomfortable in the crowd (i was); his repeated gestures of exasperation when i found myself unable to answer his questions. those brought to my attention the sheer degree of my social ineptitude. events like these at palces like this, which i had always considered outliers, are in fact prototypical. this contrast/revelation worries me to no end and is capable of causing me severe anxiety. this crippling inability to perform tasks that are completely commonplace and something that almost everyone else can safely take for granted, i am still unable to overcome even with extreme effort. what am i going to do?</div><div><br/></div><div>remember this: all attempts to explicitly modify my core behavior <u>will never be successful</u>.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
11-24 m</div><div><br/></div><div>i'm surprised at how long the drunkenness from ~1 glass of wine and two beers lasted. hours.</div><div><br/></div><div>i'm glad i went to this meetup because i saw the people i met at the Establishment and the Anna. she was the only one i really talked to. i wonder if she is being as vigilant as i am. shortly after 9 i got bored and left. the Anna gabe me a small hug which i reciprocated. somehow it wasn't unexpected. i didn't listen to anyone who was talking for the comedy show. there were many insecure comments for this one, which was weird.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
&quot;thanksgiving&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>sometimes on the weekends i wake up and hear neighbors' voices and in my half-awake state i think for a moment that i'm at home, waking up on a sunday morning with my dad reading the newspaper and my mom making breakfast and my brother on the computer. today i woke up, and was actually at home.</div><div><br/></div><div>sad that i don't get very excited to return here now. it's cold. the shower water pressure isn't as high. my bedroom doesn't feel like it anymore. the sheets and pillows keep changing. funny how, even though a lot of routines get disrupted, old habits restart immediately and familiar sounds fall back into place.</div><div><br/></div><div>the thanksgiving party was at hour house. i never eat a lot on this holiday, on which so many people look forward to stuffing themselves with food. the only turkey i had was two slices, and it had long since gone cold. the same old friends came over, some bringing an awkward chinese friend of theirs, while  i watched a movie alone (although at first Michael's parter watched <i>wreck-it ralph</i> and then <i>alien</i> at the same time as me. i'd like to think that she liked me because she edged closer to me kneeling by the couch, but i'd be becoming hysterical) the rest of the time, the parents peppered me with questions about work, which was extremely irritating. i was the only one to not play cards with the rest of them.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
11-28 f</div><div><br/></div><div>i hate going to the mall and shopping for clothes. i hardly even do that much when i do go; i get incredibly anxious, irritable, and frustrated. as a result i have very few clothes and just about nothing with which to put together an &quot;outfit&quot;.</div><div><br/></div><div>i think being back home puts all of my regular feelings in a suspended animation. while i'm here, my real life (or lack thereof) doesn't exist. when i go back after this weekend i'm going to feel lonely again. i'm going to feel like shit and as incomplete as ever.</div><div><br/></div><div>i'm too immature on too many counts. when i look at how much further i have to g o, to get to where everyone else reached years ago, i lose a lot of hope. always six years too late.</div><div><br/></div><div>zora texted me yesterday wishing happy thanksgiving. i think that thoughtful of her. the fact that she was the only one to wish me that says something about where i am right now.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
11-29 s</div><div><br/></div><div>the movie <i>the perks of being a wallflower</i> gives me a yet-to-be-identified mix of emotion, but the primary ingredient is regret. followed by nostalgia for times that never were.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div><b>11-12 r</b></div><div><br/></div><div>what happened? i&apos;ll be sad later when i think back to this time in my life and find little to nothing to read. it means there was nothing worth remembering.</div><div><br/></div><div>ROdNEY randomly messaged me his home address in google maps. it was random. in the normal maps view it looked so unpopulated that i thought it wasn&apos;t loading properly. was he showing me a bug? no, he just lives in a small village in the middle of the czech republic. there&apos;s a restaurant. a hotel. tennis courts. the area looked poor when i looked at the street view. almost like a lord of the rings setting. would have been fitting for a setting a hundred years in the past. but there was a bmw suv parked in front of one of the houses and according to him, several of his neighbors have planes. he couldn&apos;t understand why i was hesitant to show him where i lived. i eventually sent him a street view link of the outside of my building. i looked at his house and imagined him sitting inside somewhere with his R9 290X.</div><div><br/></div><div>i&apos;m starting to think i shouldn&apos;t think of my steam friends as discount friends. i actually almost opened up to DOOGIE about my loneliness. i thought about just saying it. it doesn&apos;t matter to me what he thinks of it anyway. but then he reiterated how drunk he was from taking shots while we were playing.</div><div><br/></div><div>Zora and i make small bits of contact every now and then. i miss what we used to have, but i shouldn&apos;t think of it as completely gone. we&apos;re just in a different phase. she isn&apos;t gone. for now, anyway. i don&apos;t make much of an effort in our conversations (if they&apos;re even long enough to count) and i wonder if (more like pretend) that she&apos;s sitting in front of her computer thinking the same things as me.</div><div><br/></div><div>i&apos;m actually planning on texting the Kat come thanksgiving. another ping.</div><div><br/></div><div>i cleaned my carpets last weekend because i couldn&apos;t stand it after someone came into my apartment to fix my broken thermostat while i was away. i bought a $150 carpet cleaner from amazon just for this one thing and felt so stupid while cleaning. after moving everything off the floor. of all the things a 23-year-old could be doing, i&apos;m staying up late at night cleaning my carpet with hot water and carpet shampoo. it was very dirty. i never vacuumed often. i later packed everything back up into its box and returned it. the brushes were caked in dried up grime and the tanks still had some residual water that leaked into the cardboard box. i keep thinking about all the manufacturing that went into it. all the plastic pieces and how it had to be designed.</div><div><br/></div><div>i skipped the gym today because i (only sort of) worked out yesterday what i normally do on thursdays, and i went to eats again. it was extremely awkward telling the mark and chris this simple thing. i can&apos;t believe he&apos;s 35. anyway i drove everyone to eats again. dave, valerie, some randie who seemed lacking in all sorts of confidence, and kyle this time too. him being the biggest person, of course the front seat was his. so kyle sat in my front seat today. he and valerie were on their phones the entire time at lunch. valerie talks to dave, i butt in rarely or when dave asks me the occasional random question, kyle silently browses tumblr on his phone, and the other dude i forgot was there. i notice chip while we&apos;re waiting in line. he must have come on his own again. only dave acknowledges him. i wonder how little chip would care if none of us had apparently noticed him.</div><div><br/></div><div>i can&apos;t feel it, but at this time one year ago i was fully immersed in all that is brought back when i so much as think about lights&apos;s little machines. i&apos;m going to summon enough energy to go outside this weekend to a korean bbq meetup...with the Angie. if all else fails at least the food should taste good. i focus a little bit too much on recreating the past. particularly a past so heavily overshadowed by negative emotional clouds.</div><div><br/></div><div>i shouldn&apos;t think too much about what i&apos;ll end up remembering the end of this year for. one thing i know for sure is that the thought &quot;this is plenty of time for x to happen&quot; is not true, or at least, horribly incomplete.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>11-14 s</b></div><div><br/></div><div>i made it out the door today. after consuming nothing but a bottle of soylent all day and afternoon i pushed myself outside to the korean bbq meetup. i had never been to korean bbq before so i looked up how to do it. even something this small but new was intimidating enough to have me seriously considering bailing. but i would be doing myself a disservice if i skipped. i left early but stupid traffic meant i still arrived twenty minutes after the start time. if i weren&apos;t already reasonably well acquainted with the Angie i would have felt even more horribly out of place walking into the place, somewhat upscale-looking, almost like a club (like that one yelp description). the people i recognized who were there were: the Angie and the Ryan Shanley that was it initially. there was a girl named April and another named Jasmine and i eventually realized that i had seen them at that italian dinner a couple months ago. the person who i was actually kind of looking forward to seeing was the Grace, who i thought i had parted with on good terms at that other dinner meetup in august. but I didn&apos;t even recognize her until the Angie &quot;introduced&quot; us. i half-smiled and i don&apos;t know if she remembered me, nor do i care.</div><div><br/></div><div>a couple people arrived after me, a Kat Williams, who shares a first name with the Kat, a Vivian, who I must have also seen before somewhere, a Mary, and the Kristi. the Kat Williams was in the same traffic jam as i was, evidently far behind. the Vivian was the only other asian person, a woman much older than me though. i don&apos;t know if she&apos;s korean or not. i think i have seen the Mary before too. she remained quiet, didn&apos;t eat anything, and looked at her phone the entire time without talking to anybody except the Kristi when she got there. why would she come here? i&apos;ve found myself in similar situations in the past. the Vivian kept looking at me and smiling throughout the Meal, and i found myself awkwardly looking away while smiling almost every time.</div><div><br/></div><div>the Ryan Shanley is very softspoken and always delegated his requests to the Angie, whether it was to get the waiter&apos;s attention or to ask for a plate of meat to be passed to him. not a very alpha dude. it was noticeable immediately. i need to keep in mind that this is something everyone can detect, and it is still present in me too. he awkwardly cooked the chicken on the grill that was closest to us.</div><div><br/></div><div>i didn&apos;t talk to anybody except the Angie and tiny snippets with the Vivian. because i for the food and for my first korean bbq experience, i wasn&apos;t disappointed in not &quot;connecting&quot; with people today. i didn&apos;t care. except that it was awkward handling the Angie&apos;s greetings. i still didn&apos;t know what to do. then shortly after the Kristi arrived, she reached out towards me and i thought she wanted to hug me. but she only wanted to know my answer to her message about the Angie&apos;s birthday that i had ignored. she pressed her head up against mine to speak into my ear. that physical contact. then when she asked me why i never responded, i said, &quot;i&apos;m sorry&quot; and nothing bad happened except that i declined the invitation. she seemed disappointed. it was for the Angie&apos;s birthday which is tomorrow. it made me disappointed in myself but i never reversed my decision. so i&apos;m not going wherever tomorrow.</div><div><br/></div><div>i had completely forgotten about the ice skating event that was also with this group, and of course it was also tonight. and when the Angie asked me if i would be attending that i said no. i wasn&apos;t excited about ice skating but between this and the birthday that&apos;s two opportunities that i ignored. in favor of what? being able to get to the gap store before it closed to try to exchange a pair of khakis? that they didn&apos;t even have in my size for me to try. in other words, so much complete waste. that&apos;s why it felt shitty coming home. early. before the night had properly ended. i had my car&apos;s fog lights on for the first time in weeks and listened to late night alumni.</div><div><br/></div><div>before leaving, the Vivian tapped me on the arm and said it was nice to see me again.</div><div><br/></div><div>the April also seemed disappointed that i wouldn&apos;t be going. because she couldn&apos;t skate because she has weak knees? the Angie repeatedly reassured me that i was under no pressure to go. so i didn&apos;t. maybe if i had just a little more of a push...that might have been enough to change my mind. but that&apos;s not expected from near strangers, of course.</div><div><br/></div><div>i saw the Grace taking a selfie with that tall quiet guy with the blonde hair i&apos;ve seen a few times (name Chris Banks?) and might&apos;ve caught a glimpse of the two of them holding hands? i wonder if she had been single back in august (he was there too) and something had happened between the two.</div><div><br/></div><div>the Angie went around taking photos of everyone to post, presumably. i had to get a picture with the Mary and just smiled stupidly and didn&apos;t do anything.</div><div><br/></div><div>the Jasmine looks like the pornstar &quot;Ava Taylor.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>on the way out, i stole the pair of chopsticks i used.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div><b>11-1 t</b></div><div><br/></div><div>every thing I buy online is just another orgasm.</div><div><br/></div><div>friday the 21st: that moment when christian realized he didn&apos;t have his wallet, and had to poke me to get my attention.</div><div><br/></div><div>setting strange rules for myself, such as never texting v again unless he asks me a question (I feel like I&apos;m going to give in to breaking this before it happens).</div><div><br/></div><div>tuesday the 25th: saw Harry for the first time in six months. didn&apos;t care.</div><div><br/></div><div>bina doesn&apos;t pay any attention to what I say half the time. on the way to lunch, which was across the street from my apartment building, she asked me to point out which building it is that I live in. she wasn&apos;t listening when I did.</div><div><br/></div><div>that thursday: we go to california pizza kitchen for lunch and she comments that I&apos;m a cautious driver. invites me to her friend&apos;s halloween party. I keep wondering if there&apos;s a chance she likes me (I hope both yes and no) but I guess she does enough to invite me anyway.</div><div><br/></div><div>the next day: christian doesn&apos;t want to walk up the street to rocky mountain pizza and gives a lame excuse. I don&apos;t object because he drives us to the gym all the time. the waitress Helena was there again. he definitely remembers her too. she&apos;s beautiful.</div><div><br/></div><div>this time last year I was obsessed with recalling this time two years ago. this time this year I&apos;m fussing over the transition from one to two. apparently lights&apos; &quot;slow down&quot; is about this. time is still always accelerating. the past is as distant as dreams. and then more distant.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>11-4 f</b></div><div><br/></div><div>today is my brother&apos;s birthday and I sent him $120.</div><div><br/></div><div>while I was walking to lunch a sketchy-looking man stopped me asking for obscure help, with an inconsistent and convenient story. he walked up to me and I thought for a second I was going to get mugged. then he offered his hand and I decided not to shake it. wasn&apos;t even sure what he wanted me to do since I couldn&apos;t give him the ride he wanted, and there was no point in me tagging along to the &quot;train station&quot; he also wanted to go to. trying to get his family somewhere, but no one with him. wanted to get me to withdraw cash from an ATM. I should have said I don&apos;t have a debit card. looked pissed when I kept refusing, then offered his again (I ended up shaking this time), and said he&apos;d pray for me. I turned around and walked to my car, and ended up driving somewhere else.</div><div><br/></div><div>and today I bought a new MALM dresser from ikea.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>11-15 t</b></div><div><br/></div><div>recent things</div><div><br/></div><div>the GRE, and</div><div><br/></div><div>the election</div><div><br/></div><div>I was Here when it happened.</div><div><br/></div><div>I think bina was upset with the results. a week ago.</div><div><br/></div><div>not much else that I can remember. realizing that &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE could potentially be having a really bad influence on me. going through the one year mark since last fall/winter. thanksgiving is only a week away. giving in and texting v some. early 2015 is significantly longer than one year ago. incredibly distant. my 24th birthday was two months ago. this will be my first winter in the new condo. after new year&apos;s, my first start of the year here. early 2016 now feels long ago, and I&apos;m already reminiscing about it even though it certainly didn&apos;t feel like anything special at the time. will 2017 be the same way?</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>I went to a birthday dinner for Angie tonight at canton house, a dim sum restaurant. I&apos;m not entirely sure, but I believe it&apos;s the same place as that CSA dinner I went to with tam and jennifer ha that one time and all the chinese people were there. immediately felt strange and out of place again when I saw how much older than me everyone there was. some personal friends of hers I&apos;d never met before. old white people. it was just weird. I didn&apos;t belong there. Angie gave me a hug. I thought it was fine that I was at her birthday this year because I didn&apos;t feel like going to the one last year, that that Kristi organized (she seemed disappointed when I said &quot;I couldn&apos;t make it&quot;). none of them seemed to understand the concept of a family style restaurant, or what the lazy susan was for. I only asked if we&apos;d be ordering to share or for ourselves, but I never explained it to them. maybe some of them knew and didn&apos;t bother either.</div><div><br/></div><div>I sat in silence because I didn&apos;t feel like talking to anybody there. that Mike went to great lengths...I wondered why. presents, had everyone secretly sign a card, even had a cake ready. other than me, only one person went with the dim sum and the rest each ordered a big individual dish for themselves. they looked like idiots to me. the waitress said a little chinese to me but I only responded in english and she probably thought I didn&apos;t understand her. I&apos;m afraid that I didn&apos;t tip enough.</div><div><br/></div><div>there was karaoke arranged at some karaoke place further down the road, but hell no to that. I exchanged a sentence or two with the Jasmine, whom I recognized from the korean bbq place one year ago. I remembered her face because of her cheeks. it went like this: I held eye contact for about two seconds. she asked me if I&apos;d ever done karaoke and I kept saying no. she tapped my arm as she said I should go. there was not remotely enough force to push me to go. Angie gave me another hug before I walked to my car. I met her two years ago.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>11-16 w</b></div><div><br/></div><div>I always see bina looking at meetup groups. mostly for girls. maybe we&apos;re both flawed.</div><div><br/></div><div>I drove a bunch of people to jalisco yesterday. I basically let christian decide whether to go eat or to the gym instead, even though he thought he let me. he seemed out of his element among other people. his quietness stood out again. I don&apos;t think people not as nice as Dave would talk to him. he kept making pointless comments about the salsa and chips. I do NOT want to still be as awkward and shy among people as he is when I reach his age. or like the quiet ones yesterday at the restaurant. it&apos;s not too late but I&apos;m still only passively watching myself.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>11-22 t</b></div><div><br/></div><div>things are moving too quickly. tomorrow I leave for home for the thanksgiving weekend. thanksgiving 2016. I just realized that I&apos;ll have to pack for it. I&apos;d completely forgotten. I&apos;m looking forward to listening to some music.</div><div><br/></div><div>last week:</div><div><br/></div><div>christian told me some stuff about his personal relationship with his brother, who I don&apos;t remember him ever mentioning before. it was while we were waiting in sarpino&apos;s and he was speaking too quietly so I didn&apos;t hear half of what he said. also told me some stuff about his dad wanting a new car despite getting into accidents repeatedly, wrecking his old one, and spending a lot of money on it. wonder what other situations he has. wonder if he&apos;ll get his mustang.</div><div><br/></div><div>told &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE some stuff about how difficult it is for me to talk to people in a group setting. I knew he was more outgoing and louder. I could always tell. I didn&apos;t really like this idea of opening up to him about things. I wonder if we&apos;ll meet up again either this weekend somehow, or when I (plan to) come home again for the winter.</div><div><br/></div><div>nearly two years, at this time of year, I got the gtx 980. today, I was able to get a gtx 1080 through the best buy pricing error that &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE told me about. it was a big win for me and now I&apos;m terrified that something horrible is about to happen to me.</div><div><br/></div><div>hopefully I&apos;ll be able to meet up with v too.</div><div><br/></div><div>I heard from alice today for the first time in months. I feel like with her it&apos;s just a series of one-sided transactions. she says she misses me. I wish that could mean something.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>11-26 s</b></div><div><br/></div><div>writing remains burdensome. letting thoughts pile up for days or weeks before flushing them all away on (metaphorical) paper is now normal.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;d been telling &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE that the big win I scored with the 1080 foreshadowed an imminent bad thing, and I was right, though at this moment I still haven&apos;t told him. I ended up missing my flight home on wednesday because I completely lost track of time (as I kept telling everyone) and didn&apos;t leave my apartment until barely an hour before my flight departed. I was frantic during the uber ride that cost $22 and the plane was gone by the time I reached the gate. it felt unreal and at the same time like nothing. I spent the night at a nearby hotel, somehow falling asleep before 10 pm and woke up at 3:45 for a 6:30 flight to philadelphia. I wore a new outfit.</div><div><br/></div><div>I definitely lucked out landing a standby seat on the flight and will be keeping the boarding pass. I had a long playlist of songs prepared in anticipation of my original trip with layover, but because I was still tired I just slept through the whole way and only listened to take care, take care, take care. the sun was rising just after takeoff. the people across the aisle from me were taking pictures out the window.</div><div><br/></div><div>I heard my first christmas song of the Season in the car when my dad came to pick me up.</div><div><br/></div><div>home is home and I just went in. the thanksgiving party we host every year now beginning I don&apos;t remember when is over now, but hadn&apos;t started yet when I got here. it was well before noon and I was about to have a long day since I woke up so early. I can&apos;t remember anything about thanksgiving 2014 except for showing michael a picture of the triple monitor setup I briefly had. I think my brother had a hickey. I&apos;m not sure because I&apos;ve never gotten one myself and we&apos;ll never talk about it. my parents seemed to know what it was.</div><div><br/></div><div>the girl I met last year came with her family again this time, and I still don&apos;t know her name. I thought she was the &quot;Jessie&quot; that my parents mentioned a couple times, but that turned out to be someone else, that other girl who wasn&apos;t in college yet last year. michael&apos;s sister tracy is also in college now, and lisa is 19? I can barely remember being 19. sometimes I still feel that way.</div><div><br/></div><div>I took a selfie with that girl last year. it was michael&apos;s birthday. I had no recollection at all of his birthday ever falling around this holiday. he said every year his family brings a cake. I can&apos;t remember that at all. he just turned 24, while I&apos;ve been 24 for two and a half months, and that girl is 26.</div><div><br/></div><div>I realized it took me time to warm up to them all again as michael asked me simple questions which I had a hard time answering. charles was also there. we were gathered in the living room around the tv; I had &apos;the office&apos; casting from my computer. I stopped it after the penultimate episode and switched to bojack horseman instead. we got through seven episodes throughout the night. michael left early because he was going to singapore? the next day or so? meaning he should be there by now as I&apos;m typing this down.</div><div><br/></div><div>it must have been before singing happy birthday that I paused the netflix so we could all go eat cake. I can&apos;t remember if we ever resumed after he left. forgot to mention the other girl who seemed to have come with clarke (is there an e?) and his parents and is the one with the husky. I think her accent is singaporean. I thought she was kind of cute and liked the way she would sometimes say half a sentence in mandarin. her clothes looked expensive and I think she had a mercedes or bmw key on her keychain.</div><div><br/></div><div>I believe lisa is the one who&apos;s traveling to egypt soon, where that girl with the glasses (even my parents don&apos;t know her name either) has been to before, and I mostly listened to her describe the tourism-riddled Place. I&apos;m never the one doing the talking. turns out she&apos;s been to a slew of countries and is going to peru soon? it really applied a lot of pressure on me to come up with some more concrete travel plans of my own. clark came by and sat down with us but never said anything. i thought condescendingly of him.</div><div><br/></div><div>I became pretty tired early in the night. the girl with the glasses left without saying good-bye specifically to me. I&apos;m sure her opinion of me is depressingly neutral at best. the singaporean one left shortly after. I went upstairs to take a shower and could hear them wrapping up when I got out. I talked to charles&apos;s mom for a bit. she remembers my &quot;cat&quot; hoodie.</div><div><br/></div><div>lies: telling michael that this was only my second time watching bojack horseman when it was actually my third (season 1), and; telling charles&apos;s mom that I didn&apos;t vote.</div><div><br/></div><div>I had also thought about texting the Kat, a happy thanksgiving text, but more or less forgot about it.</div><div><br/></div><div>when I woke up in the middle of the night sometime, I forgot where I was for a moment.</div><div><br/></div><div>the next day I met up with v, for the first time since last june. and it was just about the same, though that&apos;s not necessarily bad. sped down that long street out of his neighborhood, drove to battlefield state park and walked around. there were a lot more people there than we&apos;ve ever seen before. the corn fields were barren at this time of year and all the apples had fallen from the trees a while ago. we climbed up onto some railroad tracks briefly, where we took some pictures. I thought of life is strange but didn&apos;t want to lay down on the tracks.</div><div><br/></div><div>because we&apos;re in the same environment every time we see each other, it&apos;s hard for me to imagine him doing any of the things he says he&apos;s been occupied with. I just haven&apos;t seen him in any other context.</div><div><br/></div><div>we visited the best buy that I admitted to him I got caught shoplifting from. first time I told anyone about that. this location also had 1070s and 1080s and I tried telling him about how I got the 1080 for $250 off, but he wasn&apos;t paying attention. an asian employee came up to us and said something about the ps4 having the rx 480 inside. I didn&apos;t understand the gist of his comment.</div><div><br/></div><div>it got boring in there (quite crowded too) and we left for the dunkin&apos; donuts near his house. I got the boston creme. and then back to his house, where his mother and two sisters were, along with a very energetic black dog who seemed to like me. his family were beyond too hospitable. I&apos;m starting to wonder if it was even normal. offering me drinks and ice cream, seemingly going out of their way to get a box of cookies from somewhere in their basement? for me. v was extremely silent around them, and they bossed him around a lot. I&apos;d forgotten about this. the things he&apos;d always say about his family made a little more sense after seeing these interactions for the first time. it made me rather uncomfortable.</div><div><br/></div><div>we had nothing to do at his home, the things on tv were incredibly boring, and I decided to leave. no remotely extraordinary good-byes, just said see you and left. until whenever next time might be.</div><div><br/></div><div>&lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE actually thought I brought my computer with me. it would actually be possible for him to be messing with me every time he believes an absurd thing I tell him.</div><div><br/></div><div>the transitions from atlanta to home are less jarring than ever, but the distance is still there. so how will I feel when I get back down there?</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>11-27 s</b></div><div><br/></div><div>my brother is usually the one to set up the christmas tree after thanksgiving, but this year that corner of the living room remains empty. he left for cornell this morning.</div><div><br/></div><div>today my dad helped me invest in my first Stock.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div>11-3 f</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">two weeks in now, and I&apos;m beginning to know the others a little bit better. there are some who are easier to talk to and others who fall into the category where the conversation ends when it&apos;s just them and me. some of my opinions of them are turning away from my initial impressions. the Andrew was someone I perceived coldly initially, and most of the other guys who sit in the back I had written off as people I&apos;ll probably just never really get to know.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">yesterday I went with a group of them to a johnny&apos;s pizza. I rode with Zach in his ford ranger, which was old and had so much trash, dust, and cigarette ash inside. he smoked while driving and it reeked. he had to clear the passenger seat of much debris so I could sit in it. I wonder when the last time anyone sat there was. or the last time it had been cleaned, if ever. also what his home looked like.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">the waitress at the pizza place was v cute and I noticed it when she smiled at me. I listened to the other guys gossip about the Aaron and personal issues he&apos;s apparently having with his wife suddenly leaving him. then they somehow got into a deep existential conversation about heaven, hell, and purgatory, and the nature of matter and the universe.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">Zach almost seems like an archetype. his haircut, his taste in music, his truck, his smoking habit. he seems to genuinely enjoy coding, as he&apos;s brought up things he wants to learn to me multiple times now. every time he talks to me it always takes me a second to realize, because he never addresses me directly beforehand.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">yesterday I thought the Anthony was a total asshole and I kept rehearsing conversations in my head with the others about how much I dislike him. it kept bubbling to the surface. his remarks about standing desks. he kept saying shit about my makeshift ikea coffee table platform. this morning I began using it, still angry inside, and in the afternoon he made a less harsh comment on it, and followed it up by informing me that he bought one of those platforms that clamps onto the desk and slides up and down.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">later this afternoon, the Anthony went around stating that it was &quot;beer o&apos;clock&quot; and we soon filed out and headed over to three dollar cafe to hang out at the bar. he said he would be buying. I wonder how much money he has, if he&apos;s willing to do all this. the bartender was the waiter we had when we went for lunch earlier this week. there were tens of choices of beer on tap and I basically only recognized sweetwater. I got a sweetwater blue and the Anthony said that I at least got the brewery right. so it took me some time to realize that he simply talks a lot of shit.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">this was the first time I&apos;ve socialized with a group of people close to my age in a long time. I seemed to feel less pressure than I used to. maybe it&apos;s because there were no girls in our group for me to get hung up on. I didn&apos;t talk much overall but briefly joined conversations when I had something to say. the issue of standing desks got brought up again, and the Anthony declared that he only decided to buy the adjustable platform for me to try because he liked my mechanical keyboard. it&apos;s interesting that that shitty old used keyboard continues to attract so much attention. also that I didn&apos;t really care about either the Anthony&apos;s disapproval or his respect. I wonder if a past version of myself would have placed more value in his approval. he&apos;s like the JB in some aspects. I could still use some loosening up around people like him though. he still makes me feel self-conscious. I need this exercise.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div>11-7 t</div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">technically fall began one and a half months ago, but I didn&apos;t notice the leaves until last weekend when I went to the running meetup group for the third time. that Cody was there again, but so was his friend a Jay, and I&apos;d forgotten that they seem to know each other from somewhere previously and he seemed more interested in talking to him than me.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">daylight savings time also ended that weekend, so it gets dark early now and that transition was rather sudden. I don&apos;t remember noticing this before. this should be an official boundary.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I&apos;ve been thinking about the various ways that this fall parallels fall of 2014. a lights album, a new workplace, a rubyetc &quot;cat&quot; hoodie, theRadBrad playing an assassin&apos;s creed game.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I&apos;ve been rereading my earliest journal entries from 2012. I had wanted to begin earlier this year in february/march because that time of 2012 was when I first began writing them, but I&apos;d forgotten about them until now. I think I&apos;ll keep binging my own journals until I reach my end of college. so far I&apos;ve gone through the end of sophomore year, barcelona, and fall of 2012, following the rise and fall of various characters including anjaly and melissa.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">it&apos;s sad for multiple reasons, and traveling through so much time at once enables me to get a better picture of what kind of person I was. some emotions I describe are ones I don&apos;t recall feeling so early on. some of it is still the same today. I describe a lot of loneliness, and dedicated so much attention to all the people who definitely never thought of me much, expecting them to treat me as a good friend even though I gave them nothing first. feeling entitled to others&apos; attention, constantly feeling bitter when it wasn&apos;t given to me, and dedicating so much of mine to every minute &quot;encounter&quot; and interaction with the ones I knew. a lot of frustration I didn&apos;t know how to fix. I wasn&apos;t quite aware of what my problems were and dealt with them very counter-productively. also a lot of stupid metaphors.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">reading about anjaly and melissa make me the saddest. they were easily the biggest missed connections.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">so far I&apos;m drawn to Zach the most. he seems eager to help me even though we&apos;re working on different things, but it&apos;s difficult to understand the things he describes to me, and not just because I don&apos;t have a working understanding of all these projects. while I don&apos;t hate the Anthony as I once would have, he&apos;s someone I&apos;ll never mesh with. if it&apos;s just me and him alone, we won&apos;t talk. the Andrew still likes talking about his dating life.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">change in environment has resulted in a handful of habit changes, such as less overall reddit time. I haven&apos;t gotten breakfast at mcdonald&apos;s since I started here, but I&apos;m sure it&apos;s only a matter of time. I&apos;ve been coming early and going a bit late, but it doesn&apos;t really matter because I do almost nothing here or there.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I noticed sometime Zora posted to facebook recently reading something like &quot;could use someone to talk to&quot; and a bit later she messaged me on steam. only to say that she didn&apos;t feel like talking and that she&apos;d text me. of course she didn&apos;t, but today I did telling her about my journal and some parts where I mention her. interestingly, she seems to think that I had a crush on her back then, which is definitely not true. I did enjoy playing L4D2 with her and poured too many hours into the game than I should have while I was still in school, but if I recall correctly, she was the one with the crush on me (and eventually, a handful of other people we played with). she mentioned another relationship she was in ending badly recently, but didn&apos;t tell me any more about it.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">v hasn&apos;t responded to any of my garbage texts for the past three months until today, when I said we should hang out at thanksgiving again. he said he won&apos;t be around, which is 0% surprising. looks like he clocked out again and who knows if/when he&apos;ll be back. I can never stop myself.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div>11-8 w</div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">a few nights ago I had a dream where I&apos;m sitting in a group of people at some kind of seminar. I recognize a few but the only one I recall is mary-ann ionascu. the presenter of the thing says to raise your hand if you&apos;re a &quot;homemade millionare,&quot; and several of the people I recognize, including mary-ann, raise their hands. I&apos;m in awe and also feeling defeated.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">it&apos;s amazing that I still think about her at all. do you someone like her would be impressed with the sort of expensive things I want to buy myself to hide behind?</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I chatted with ROdNEY this morning about Zora and her relationships, and my lack of relationships, and he asked me, &quot;what do you want me to tell you.&quot; this was true. perhaps I was subconsciously hoping for him to tell me again that I&apos;m still young and that I have time left. a reason to continue waiting before doing anything. he also called me submissive, which is new, and at the same time, something I already knew. but this is the first time someone has told me that.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>11-9 r</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">yesterday I ran into the asian guy, I think his name is Joel, who I and christian always saw at the crc. he asked me where christian is and apparently christian hasn&apos;t been here in a while. I would think that it&apos;s because he found a new gym, but just a few days ago I asked him and he said he&apos;s still sticking with the crc for now. wonder what he&apos;s going to do. this was the first normal conversation I had with Joel. normally it&apos;s christian who talks to him.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I&apos;m really hoping that I&apos;m not coming across as too cold and distant to the other guys at work. I&apos;ve gone out with lunch to them several times and don&apos;t say much. I pay a lot of attention to how they respond when I do chime in. surface level conversation is easier. today I rode with the Andrew in the front seat of his car. he&apos;s the kind of person with whom my barrier will take a while to break down, if it ever does.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">Zach&apos;s truck started acting up a couple days ago so he&apos;s getting a new car now. I get the impression that he doesn&apos;t have his life entirely &quot;in order.&quot; his clothes are old and his truck was very messy and dirty. I&apos;m not judging, just observing. I&apos;m meshing with him the best so far.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div>11-11 s</div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">the standing platform that the Danny/Anthony ordered for me arrived yesterday, and they seemed more excited about it than I was. immediately they set out opening the box and assembling it, reminding me that I&apos;d be their guinea pig. they&apos;ll probably buy more for some of the others if it turns out to work well. the Anthony is still intimidating to talk to. I wonder how he became the kind of person he is. he seems like he could have another side to him that he rarely shows to anybody. he has a distinct style that definitely stands out more than the rest of us who just dress normally casually. he&apos;s mostly in black, likes wearing skinny pants paired with derbies or leather chelsea-looking boots. most of his head is buzzed except for a strip down the middle; in the center of the top of his head is a tiny ponytail.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">the Danny is kind of pudgy and speaks very softly with his soft voice. he has a new, spiced-up honda civic that he seems to take extra care of.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">the Cody was at the running meetup again and he still prefers talking to his friend Jay. today I exchanged a handful of words with a couple new people. they were mostly just introductions but this is still meaningful to me, which is particularly sad having just finished reading my journal entries written while I was at tech. the Judith, I think, who I ran next to a couple weeks ago said hi to me presumably because she recognized me. but that asian girl who I last saw during the first time I attended the group was there too, and she ran off with her. it&apos;s noticeable how people immediately stick to the ones they know. the older asian guy whose name is Kilyoung remained aloof, and so did the other asian guy whose name is Victor. the Victor actually runs quite fast. we briefly got lost on the trail today and I heard his voice, which was very soft and gentle-sounding. not what I would have expected.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I ended up running on my own for the most part and rejoined the group, waiting for the rest to show up. I kept glancing at the asian girl but kept my arms crossed, looking away and not talking much, probably making myself seem distant and cold. during the walk to jason&apos;s deli, she said to me that I must be cold because I was only wearing shorts and a long sleeve t-shirt, and I&apos;m thinking about that even now (that she talked to me at all). I don&apos;t even know her name. I was hoping to sit next to her at the restaurant, but the table arrangement didn&apos;t allow for that, and she ended up leaving with half the group before I was ready to, so I never got myself to talk to her. the last I saw of her was her driving past me in her car while I was on my way to my own. the Cody said he&apos;ll be here again next week. how do I make friends?</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">~</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I sporadically texted melissa again a few days ago and she actually replied to me. apologizing for not responding and asking a little about what I read from my journal that I mentioned to her. I told her I miss her.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">while hanging out at jason&apos;s deli, the Cody mentioned his workplace already having a christmas tree up. some of the usual holidays-coming-earlier-every-year discussion followed, and I thought about how I&apos;m actually not really seeing any holiday spirit yet. nor did I see anything for halloween. I honestly can&apos;t recall seeing a single halloween decoration anywhere.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div>11-13 m</div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">after doing most of the assembly of this sit-stand workstation mount, they simply left the tools and old hardware strewn about everywhere. probably never to be moved until whenever this space gets rearranged. they don&apos;t belong to anybody, I guess.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I visited a different the container store location this weekend and noticed a lot more old people. some people were buying christmas-themed wrapping paper.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">yesterday was an especially depressing sunday because I woke up early at 7:30 and had nothing to do and nowhere to go for the entire day. I had never been more aware of how badly I was wasting all the hours in a day. 15 hours, doing nothing.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I don&apos;t want to play l4d2 to kill time, especially not when</span><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">DOOGIE isn&apos;t online, but even when he is I usually don&apos;t feel like it anymore. the problem is that I have nothing to replace it with, nothing else and more importantly no other people to dedicate my time to. I&apos;ve been exaggerating how angry I get while in-game, and have &quot;rage-quit&quot; multiple times. artificially amping up the rage in my messages to him about the game.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">~</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">today I met the Gorm. I&apos;d recalled someone mentioning that he would be coming here this week, and I saw him walk in with the Anthony this morning. I never had an image in mind of what I expected him to look like, but he doesn&apos;t look how I thought he would. younger than I thought, maybe. my hair always looks like shit after I get a haircut, and I felt self-conscious. the others have all met him already, like multiple times, and they greeted him warmly. in a way that I don&apos;t see myself ever welcoming someone with whom I have only a work relationship.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I ended up going to lunch with him, the Anthony, and Zach to a one rooster, which used to be called chow baby. I had gone there one other time with ACF while I was still at tech. Zach drove and his new car, which isn&apos;t even a week old, already smells of cigarettes. the Anthony actually asked me some normal questions without using his usual tone. I noticed that the Gorm and Zach tend to use the same phrases repeatedly. I must have heard the former use the phrase &quot;forever and a day&quot; when referring to something taking a long time. Zach likes saying that &quot;it&apos;s been a minute&quot; since the last time he did something he hasn&apos;t done in a while. all three of them smoke, and I could hardly bear the stench of cigarettes on the way back as it filled the car.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I went to the crc later in the evening because I had to stay and figure shit out with the Gorm. watching and listening to him and the others discussing and testing with all the different devices made me aware of how little I know, and how I&apos;m not above any of them just because none of them are developers. at the gym while waiting for a squat rack I heard two students behind me talking, and I&apos;ve never heard more obviously pretentious people forcefully projecting a fake personality. this set them apart from people like the Anthony. when he talks shit, it&apos;s completely genuine, and that&apos;s why I don&apos;t get offended.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">that girl who&apos;s a crc employee, who looks like a cross between melaena roberts (from bcn) and abbey (from 2015), and who I&apos;ve seen mulltiple times when I go in the evenings, was there again, and she was talking to an asian guy on the benches. I didn&apos;t want to write about this originally because I thought they weren&apos;t worth my attention, but I still want to note what I noticed about their interaction. he offered to work in with someone who was waiting for a bench, and the guy waiting next to me gestured for me to go, so I went and worked in with him. she called him a nice person. every time I see her she&apos;s always standing around talking to people. I thought maybe she liked him but afterwards I wasn&apos;t sure. he seemed to me to be trying very hard to play it cool around her, and honestly so was I as I tried to ignore them. she kept laughing loudly. a little later another came by and they talked about bumble and tinder. I mostly noticed the coldly superior vibe I perceived from him as soon as I walked up to his bench.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I went to eats and talked to the girl cashier there (the one with the dyed hair), after I overheard her talking to the people in front of me about having just turned 25. I decided to comment on it and she seemed pretty okay talking to me. I told her I&apos;d just turned 25 myself two months ago and when my birthday is. hers is oct. 8. was that jessie&apos;s birthday too? she thought I was older than I am, but I didn&apos;t think to ask how old she thought I was. she wished me a happy birthday. I agreed with what she said about 25 being a milestone and feeling different. she said it was because 25 is no longer early 20&apos;s but is the entrance to mid-20&apos;s. and how terrifying it is from here. then we just smiled at each when I didn&apos;t say anything else. I tipped a dollar. after I left, I thought of better things I could have said. I know that she was prettier I would have put more weight on this brief conversation.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div>11-14 t</div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">Zach&apos;s been wearing button-down shirts and old-looking black leather shoes for the past couple days. some of the others teased him about it being because the Gorm was visiting. he looked a little strange in a shirt, even though it was just a casual shirt; like it didn&apos;t suit him and even such a casual shirt was too fancy. I feel the same way about myself when I look at myself in the mirror while wearing a shirt. I like how easygoing he is and his good-natured responses to the Anthony&apos;s snark. speaking of him, I heard the Danny telling him off this afternoon/evening about how he was ignoring the 5-6 people gathered around him waiting for him to do something. Danny said to Anthony that he should have said something to them, and he countered that no one asked him anything. it seemed very childish to me and not surprising at all now that I&apos;ve been around him for a while.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div>11-16 r</div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I hope my frustration while working with Zach hasn&apos;t shown too much, because he&apos;s terrible at explaining things. he&apos;s also apologetic for coming in to work so late when I come so early.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">today everyone made various suggestions for lunch and a place was chosen at random. the Andrew seemed very happy that his suggestion was initially picked, only for everyone to ignore it and continue suggesting other places. in the end we decided on an indian buffet after 1.5 hours of sitting around. the Andrew was the only one who didn&apos;t go. I want to say I&apos;m not surprised. at the table the Aaron made some bad jokes that everyone ignored. the discussion turned to girls again and I found myself shying away, trying to ignore them by focusing on eating.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div>11-17 f</div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">the leaves have been yellow and red for a while now and are scattered all over the ground. I feel like this is the first time that I&apos;m noticing this, in all these years. november is more than half over and there seems to barely be a month left of the last phase of this year. the transitions continue to become less apparent.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">the Gorm has been pretty casual with me and I&apos;m still afraid to feel comfortable, because I still don&apos;t feel confident and entirely competent. all week I&apos;ve been working with Zach on the mapper file, which is just a lot of hard-coded xml. it all seems very inefficient and fragile. almost mere busywork. I&apos;m getting paid for this?</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I&apos;ve only bought four separate things this month (eyeglasses, two pairs of shoes, and uniqlo tights) but the cost of them all still adds up to a thousand dollars. for one and a half to two years, my life has been revolving around buying distractions and waiting for them to be delivered so I can open them up and focus on those instead of real life and myself. I don&apos;t know if I should attribute this to nofap as well. it&apos;s like I&apos;m resetting my mind to no longer look toward the rush of buying new things (clothes). if I stop giving myself these comforts to hide in, I&apos;ll have to go out and do something real. but the holiday season is coming and sales will start soon. it may all implode once again.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div>11-18 s</div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I haven’t been this drunk in a LONG time. After the Meetup concluded I ended up hanging out with a Selena, two Marks, and the Barbara. We sat at Henry’s, a Mexican place, and now at a world of beer. Where I got the Hefeweizen. I know the only reason I stayed is because of Barbara. Mark 1 seemed to be hitting on her, then she got quiet. I don’t think she’s interested in me at all but I still have her number. She might be bi? I’m pretty “happy” right now but I know I won’t be truly happy. I’m still glad I stuck around for this. They all called me handsome but I don’t know how sincere I can believe it to be. As I’m writing this they think I’m talking to someone (a girl). But there’s only so much I can accept from them while they and I are all drunk.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">Mark 1 just said that his mission is to get me laid, and the sad thing is that that’s not the first time someone has told me this. I think once everything calms down and we all sober up, nothing is going to happen again.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">After a sobering 2-3 mile walk to loca luna, we finally ended up parting ways. Cut through the dark park on the way but simply walked down 10th on the way back after the staff there, who could definitely tell that we were all drunk, told us there were no open tables. Returned to Jason’s deli to fill barbie’s water bottle, and Mark 1 said bye after we determined that we were all fit to drive once again. Barb gave us all a hug. My car was closest so she and mark 2 walked further down myrtle I get her. Mark 2 has a Kia Optima I believe, and barb has a Mazda Miata. I haven’t seen either of them leaving. The silence is defeaning. I know better than to get my hopes up, but this should still perhaps be considered a fine first step.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">~</span></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I just got back home and I&apos;m still very slightly drunk. perhaps I&apos;ll write a more comprehensive sequence tomorrow. I deliberately went further up myrtle st. to see if I could catch a glimpse of mark 2&apos;s and barb&apos;s cars and I saw barb drive past me, but I lost her by the time I turned around. one thing I remember mark 1 saying, while we were at WoB, is that this was living right now. hanging out with &quot;new friends&quot; and drinking together. I thought about how this is just what people do when they live, and I agreed. whether anything lasting comes out of it or not. I remained sober enough throughout the evening to keep that in mind. we kept giving mark 2 shit about his &quot;girlfriend&quot; and he kept walking on the opposite side of the street, and ahead of us. a couple times we thought he ditched us, but he ended up rejoining. barb accidentally touched by butt about three times, but she said five. she apologized each time. it felt much later than it actually was. time passed slowly while I was drunk. I thought it was 9:30 but it was really only 8. the walk back from loca luna felt much farther than the walk to it. on the way we cut through the park and I could see the dim outline of the hills against the faint sky.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I know I&apos;m going to be thinking about her for a long time. she and mark 1 kept touching. I would have felt far worse if someone closer to my age were in his place. I couldn&apos;t stop imagining her intimately. her underwear outline was clearly visible through her leggings. mark 1 was being the realest, repeatedly mentioning to us, as well as her directly, how hot she was. especially when she left the table to introduce herself to a girl at another table (I kept asking who it was while they were talking about her but they never answered me). how strange that I&apos;d end up walking around midtown with her all day when she caught my eye immediately early this morning.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I almost didn&apos;t hang out with them at all. I thought maybe she liked the Cody because they talked to each other for a bit, but he left after jason&apos;s deli and I decided to stick with them. I was cold and uncomfortable at Henry&apos;s, and wanted to leave, but didn&apos;t...after they started talking about finding another place to go to. a Selena left after Henry&apos;s. at one point, when everyone but us two left for the bathroom, she said to me that mark 1 was hitting on barb, and I completely agreed. I got my hoodie from my car and from there we walked to Zocalo, where they got margarita pitchers and I got myself a mojito. I hadn&apos;t gotten one in years, and the familiar gasoline taste came rushing back and reminded me strongly of barcelona. mark 1 handed barb his phone and she gave him her number. a little while later I handed her my phone and she gave me her number. but at the time I didn&apos;t realize how drunk she most likely was and have no idea what I can say to her.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">they kept telling me I should get to online dating, but they were also drunk at the time.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">next week is thanksgiving so I won&apos;t see any of them for a minimum of two weeks.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>11-19 n</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I guess Cody is a friend now.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">Barbara is this year&apos;s Abbey, and Cody is this year&apos;s Krish.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I found the hiking meetup event that Cody mentioned yesterday. before driving there this morning, I texted Barbara. at the park, I recognized Cody&apos;s car before I saw him. it was chilly and he and I were the only ones in shorts. they were passing name tags around, but I never bothered trying to get one. there were quite a few people who showed up for the hike.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">we started walking and Cody and I talked about various things, and he suddenly remembered that I&apos;d gone to hang out with a handful of the other running guys yesterday. I told him all about how crazy it got with Barbara, Mark 1, and Mark 2. there were some lulls in our conversation, but one thing I like about Cody is that he&apos;s actually often the one to break silence after it falls. he seemed quite interested in Mark 1 and his behavior, returning to that topic several times. I was able to get a better grasp on the situation after hearing Cody&apos;s input.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">Mark 1 has to be in his late 40&apos;s at least, but he acts like someone much younger, in his 20&apos;s. like a frat boy. and that side of him came out more the more he drank. Cody must have been able to pick up on that from his interactions with him at jason&apos;s deli. as for Mark 2, he had to be interested in Barbara as well, but was much quieter throughout the day. I can remember Mark 1 being obnoxious, but not much from Mark 2. I also said that of course I like Barbara too, that she was drunk when she gave us all her number, and that she&apos;s clearly not interested in me. Although she did text me back a couple times, but only in a standard way.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">aside from that, Cody and I talked about hiking, meetup groups, and waking up earlier in the morning.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">the group leader stopped us a couple times for some &quot;networking&quot; and introductions, but I didn&apos;t pay attention to any of that. I attempted to avoid introducing myself, but the leader pointed me out and I said a simple thing.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">on the way back to the parking lot, a guy named Homer suddenly introduced himself, and we spoke for a bit about what we do for work. I wasn&apos;t very interested in talking to him because I already had Cody, and I was fine with it when he picked up the conversation with Homer instead.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">we went to lunch at a restaurant called chuy&apos;s, which was well-decorated but ended up serving bad food. Cody told me that his ex-girlfriend lives nearby, which is why he finds it awkward being in this area. I couldn&apos;t relate. and I still asked him what I should text Barbara. I was showing him the short conversation on my phone, and someone sitting across from us asked what we were watching. Cody explained that I&apos;m texting a girl and the other guy just said, &quot;oh.&quot; the guy sitting on the other side of me was an older dude with a high voice who reminded me a little of the passive aggressive old man, and I mostly ignored him.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I learned a little more about Mark 2 when we continued discussing them at our table. Cody had talked to him too, and reported that Mark 2 seems to have some skewed viewpoints on things, and appears to have bottled-up hate inside him, towards women. this I had not perceived at all, all throughout yesterday, and I was slightly disturbed.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">Cody and I exchanged numbers, finally.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">~</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I want to fuck Barbara.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">there&apos;s nothing special about her. she just happens to be the one present at the moment. there is no way she&apos;s thinking about me the way I am about her. I&apos;m alone again this afternoon, and she seems less real already.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">the curtains fall away when I&apos;m out there with people. all of my carefully curated fantasies cease mattering. they&apos;ll creep back up if I don&apos;t go outside often enough.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div>11-21 t</div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">the Homer messaged me on meetup yesterday inviting me to his house for thanksgiving. I told Cody about it and we kind of made fun of him.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">one thing Cody mentioned while on the hike sunday was that he wanted to introduce me to a vietnamese girl friend of his.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">yesterday I went to lunch at three dollar cafe again with Zach. I think we&apos;re getting along fairly well.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">thanksgiving really crept out out of nowhere this year. I feel completely unprepared. we&apos;ll have our usual family party at home.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I asked Barbara if she wanted to meet for a drink and she waited all day before answering me with a no equivalent. I tried not to think about her too much. I hope I can keep her as a friend. I tried telling Zach about it but he had little to say.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div>11-23 r</div></div><div><br/></div><div>I flew home yesterday without updating anyone about it on the way. v isn&apos;t here. &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE wished me a happy thanksgiving and will probably be the only one to do so. I miss waking up to christmas music every morning for a month.</div><div><br/></div><div>I love that people love decorating their bodies and getting drunk. it&apos;s what the ancient egyptians did, and we still do it today. we just have cars and the internet now. I don&apos;t have time to worry about whether I should keep this or that t-shirt.</div><div><br/></div><div>I can&apos;t recall when this thanksgiving tradition at our house began. yesterday I learned that my uncle and cousin (and aunt?) would be flying over, and I&apos;m so distant from them that it&apos;s strange to be mentioning them at all. alice won&apos;t be here because she went home with her boyfriend. I wonder how many times they&apos;ve had sex with each other. that leaves the usual 2-3 people at most who I can talk to at all, and they all prefer playing their card game all night, and I bought some cabernet sauvignon for myself, and I think I&apos;m just going to end up bored for hours.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>I knew I would end up resorting to texting to try to feel less alone.</div><div><br/></div><div>Lisa and her parents arrived first, and they talked about me for a bit while I awkwardly milled about. Of course they have no reason to keep track of my time. Clarke arrived by himself next. Lisa is on her laptop and we’re just watching my brother play super Mario odyssey on his switch.</div><div><br/></div><div>I just want to start drinking already.</div><div><br/></div><div>Michael and Tracy just got here and I had this vision of Michael asking my brother about the game. I’m just watching.</div><div><br/></div><div>after playing a little mario kart together and eating random food. tracy, michael, and charles are at the card table. while the other five of us (me, my brother, lisa, clarke, and jessie) are independently in the living room. none of us talking, each of us on a phone, laptop, or both. this is fine.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>I took a while replying to u/sustainablesmile&apos;s latest message, and when I got back lisa was curled up on the couch asleep. eric and jessie went to the mall. clarke milled about, bored with nothing to do. lisa watched some korean drama (presumably) while I played some music on the tv. clarke left. I&apos;m about to take a shower and go to bed.</div><div><br/></div><div>I guess today marks the beginning of the holiday season that runs through christmas until new year&apos;s.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m interested to see what happens tomorrow.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div>11-28 t</div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">last friday just came and went. I saw my aunt/uncle Howard and Linda, for the first time in over six years, for a few hours. she was rather quiet and shy. not sure why I was expecting otherwise. this is probably only the fourth of fifth time I&apos;ve ever seen her in my life. she was wearing leggings, a sort of overcoat, a checked scarf, and sunglasses that looked to be from tom ford, but I wasn&apos;t sure. they sat together awkwardly on the couch while my parents scurried back and forth bringing them water and snacks. Howard asked my brother college and career questions. I didn&apos;t know what to do with my body. we went to lunch at the shanghai restaurant, and then they just left.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">on saturday night I bought my brother alcohol again. I also dropped my phone and cracked the screen for the first time, and I didn&apos;t care.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">on sunday we went together to jersey city and walked a little bit along the hudson river. visited my dad&apos;s new work building, then went separate ways with my mom and brother, who was going back to cornell. I ate lunch with my dad at a sichuan restaurant, and then he dropped me off at the airport where I was a couple hours early. on the plane, I sat next to a girl and her mother.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">this week, Michael Balzer, the ceo of the company I work at now, is at the atlanta office again. he asked me if everything was going alright and I said it was all fine. his visit coincides with the arrival of a new employee, another asian guy named John. he wears boots. he and Michael talked all day, presumably about sales stuff. Michael and I said almost nothing to each other.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">11-3 s</span></div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday I spent the work day working with Ben to get my linux environment set up. we laughed and joked a lot while sitting next to Blessed. it took me minutes to do something that Ben said Zach took four days to do. we went to lunch at Zaxby&apos;s and talked about Blessed and Gorm some more. in the evening, he messaged me on steam to say that he had a blast linuxing with me.</div><div><br/></div><div>also yesterday, I did what I&apos;d like to think was the mature thing and asked &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE about his &quot;ending it,&quot; &quot;it&quot; referring to L4D2. essentially confronting him about his unfriending me, although I didn&apos;t mention it explicitly; he knew what I meant of course. I finally, finally agreed to stop my rampant behavior, and he said I was &quot;mad cool&quot; and refriended me soon after. even suggesting we play a quick game, but I couldn&apos;t because I was heading out to dinner</div><div><br/></div><div>with Jordan. the promise of northern china eatery was fulfilled; I sat next to her at the table and we ordered one soup dumplings, one pan fried pork buns, one scallion pancakes, and one spicy stir-fry beef dish. talking all the while. we split the food pretty evenly, and I covered the bill. at nearly $55, this was the most expensive outing yet. we followed the same format as we did on tuesday, and headed to mango mango for dessert after finishing, as it was close enough to walk. I conspicuously failed to hold her hand on the way there. I also hadn&apos;t given her a hug when we met up this time.</div><div><br/></div><div>we decided on a dessert to share, and she took the initiative once more to pay for it. the dessert itself was quite nice, including mango ice cream. on our way out, I noticed someone wearing the common projects achilles sneakers in that dusty pink color. as soon as we stepped outside, she made a show of being cold, and this time I took the hint and tried putting my arm around her waist, but she switched to hand-holding instead. and she wasn&apos;t just holding my hand, but onto my arm also. we walked back to my car, passing hers, and the lot and restaurant were empty because it had closed, but there were still people visible in the kitchen, so we wouldn&apos;t be entirely alone. we both wanted to make out with each other, but there was no smooth, convenient way to do so. we ended up simply climbing into her car and getting on with it in there. things got slightly more heated than last time; once again I had my hand on her chest, but it was harder to do anything because she had a thick sweater on. she was making those tiny moans again. she had one hand inside my hoodie, rubbing my shoulder, her other hand caressing my neck. I put my hand on the inside of her thighs, where it was really warm, and eventually started applying some pressure, which she seemed to like. towards the end, she began doing the same thing to me. at one point, she moved her kisses from my mouth up to my ear, which was unexpectedly hot. we kept pausing for short breaks in between, and I still have to learn to more effectively initiate or re-initiate on my own.</div><div><br/></div><div>even after we finally exited her vehicle, she continued to pull me to her and plant kisses on me, and I always reciprocated. she accompanied me back to my car, moving my hand to her ass, which I squeezed. finally pressing our bodies together, with her arms wrapped around my neck and mine around her waist, squeezing some more.</div><div><br/></div><div>I left that night feeling more uncertain than ever. in the span of a week, I already feel almost accustomed to all this making out. I keep trying to envision a future with this girl. where are the necessary emotions? I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s her, or if it&apos;s the sheer terror at the thought of actually sharing my life with someone.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">11-5 m</span></div><div><br/></div><div>I had dinner at so kong dong with dorothy last night, after we assumed cody was still busy fucking around with his Brittany. it&apos;s a good thing that she seems to consider me as someone valuable to keep around. we discussed the Diana from the day before, and how her quietness and manner of dress made her more feminine. dorothy&apos;s worried that she isn&apos;t feminine enough, and I can kind of see that. did my best to offer some suggestions on how she could improve. we drove to tea top after, where I got my earl grey again (must remember to leave out the boba next time). there I admitted to dorothy and myself that I think Diana&apos;s cute. I also finally showed her Jordan&apos;s tinder profile, and she said that she&apos;s really cute. and was surprised at her height.</div></div><div><br/></div><div>the onset of the final phase of the year should coincide with daylight savings time ending. the transition felt sudden and unusually noticeable this time. in the span of just a weekend. it was already dark when I left the office today, and looking through the lit windows was reminiscent of this time last year, when I first joined the company.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">11-7 w</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>I should be happy but instead I feel so anxious about this whole thing.</div><div><br/></div><div>Jordan and I met up for the fourth time tonight. I paid for most of this stupidly expensive dinner (an extra source of anxiety) although I ended up allowing her to foot the tip. We couldn&apos;t go to the sharetea 1.3 miles away, so we hopped into my car, drove like a hundred feet to a secluded area, and started our usual again. This time it got friskier still; she went to town on my ear a couple times, and I returned the favor. Fondling her chest, finally putting my hand underneath her shirt and grabbing her breast. Rubbing her over her jeans. A couple rounds of this and I think she had an orgasm in my car. Throughout this entire experience I never once had the &quot;this is really happening&quot; feeling. And that is the big red flag for me. I also remained soft for almost all of it, even while she was using her hands to rub on me. I wonder if she was having trouble finding it, or wondering why I wasn&apos;t hard.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">11-8 r</span></div><div><br/></div><div>I think it&apos;s long past the time to give up on Blessed. between his physicality, his bullshit promises, his in-your-face and uncaring attitude...it&apos;s taken me too long to learn to not trust what he says. I became pissed off yesterday when he took me outside to tell me that Gorm has been chewing him out because of me, only for my renewed resolve to leave the company to get doused again when I overheard him telling Anthony that he feels my pain about having to work on terrible code. I&apos;m glad I get my cathartic discussions with Ben to relieve the stress, and today he made a comment about me eventually learning go which assumes that I&apos;ll be staying at this job for the long term.</div><div><br/></div><div>before my fourth date with Jordan yesterday, I texted cody and dorothy about my concerns. dorothy basically told me that whatever my apprehensions may be, if I &quot;really like her&quot; then I&apos;ll know. and I think I know that I don&apos;t &quot;really like&quot; Jordan. the thought of getting physical with her almost makes me sick. but it doesn&apos;t have anything to do with what she looks like. and yet we&apos;d gone further still. putting my hand on her neck, under her shirt squeezing her breast, feeling her nipple. kissing all the while, her tongue in my ear, me awkwardly doing the same to her. it just never felt right. not an ounce of a this-is-really-happening feeling. not even while I was apparently making her cum.</div><div><br/></div><div>in our texts today she said that things went a little out of control, and that she wanted to keep it tame. and I was happy to agree, because I&apos;m not feeling this at all. I have no idea how I want things to move forward...if at all.</div><div><br/></div><div>I only learned today that we&apos;re moving to the new office building...tomorrow. it was a complete surprise, as I hadn&apos;t anticipated moving for another few weeks. this suddenly leaves me with no time left to savor the existing space before leaving it forever.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">11-12 m</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>cody&apos;s pattern of arriving late at the park and running a reduced distance.</div><div><br/></div><div>I noticed David enjoying talking about himself and his life at the table at jason&apos;s deli. I forgot that Ben was still sitting there until I happened to turn my head and see him. I myself said very little as well, only a small bit when cody asked me some questions about coding. the indian guy sitting next to us chimed in a bit there. David mentioned that during the election earlier that week, he wrote in his own name for every position on the ballot, something that one of the others at the table did not agree with at all. he seemed to sense this and double down defending his action, but ultimately I&apos;m not sure how genuine he was being. his reasoning made no sense to me.</div><div><br/></div><div>later on saturday, I went to cinebistro for the second time to watch &apos;overlord&apos; with dorothy, Jay, and Claire. dorothy sent the invite in the messenger group, and Jay noticeably mobilized himself after Claire gave her confirmation. although she simply left after the movie was over. the rest of us hung out at a &apos;hobnob&apos; next door for a bit. dorothy referred to Jordan as my &quot;steady&quot; and I sort of verbally admitted that I&apos;m not sure how I feel about her. I don&apos;t feel like initiating anything with her anymore, and not having to think about what I or she wants to do physically feels relieving.</div><div><br/></div><div>last night the Shelly actually called me. I let it go, and asked her if she meant to call, and she did. again unsure of how I feel about this. always unsure. always will be? is the key always to just take the chance?</div><div><br/></div><div>also last night, Ben and I got talking about our apprehensions of the shiji acquisition. we both agreed to convene after two weeks to discuss how we feel then about the change.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>communication with Jordan may be slowing down. the Lilly on cmb seems to have lost interest, despite her being the only person to have ever messaged me first. earlier this evening, Shelly called me on my phone again, and we ended up talking for about half an hour. I&apos;m worried that she&apos;ll be losing interest in me too. funny how I suddenly want people so much more the moment they show signs of leaving. she told me that I should talk more, which is a strong indication that my conversation skills are still weak.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">11-15 r</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>there were few recognizable people at the TAP event at flip burger yesterday evening. dorothy arrived at my place with Li and we drove there together. on the way, dorothy ranted to Li about Ben, who actually happened to be present when we got there. so Li got to meet Ben, and I don&apos;t remember what else we talked about until most of the people left and a few stopped by at our table to talk. the Oliver, the Wellington, etc. the Vinson reappeared, and shortly after I found myself judging him for his slightly awkward mannerisms, he mentioned his current and previous girlfriends. and offered some analysis on my date with the Amy last month, after dorothy spilled the beans again, to him. that was plenty enough to change my outlook of him.</div><div><br/></div><div>take a moment to reflect on the play; dorothy expertly masking her disdain and contempt for Ben the moment he sauntered up to our table. he being far too clueless to come close to picking up on the act. me observing from the sidelines. it&apos;s shitty for everyone.</div><div><br/></div><div>the Shelly and I had another phone conversation; each one we&apos;ve had so far has lasted at least 25 minutes. today she explicitly asked (texted) me about meeting up, and she was simultaneously direct and shy about the subject over the phone. I realized that she&apos;s inexperienced when it comes to meeting people from online, and that I wouldn&apos;t be able to lean on her one bit. we&apos;ve right now set a date for this saturday at 3 pm. I think she&apos;s taking too far of a backseat, and I&apos;m going to have a lot of conversational weight to pull. no signs, no guidance.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">11-16 f</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>in a two-hour long work meeting yesterday, I noticed when Blessed pointed out an unnecessary return statement within an if block, and when I told him that I saw it he slapped the back of my head and said I&apos;m a true engineer. I&apos;m embarrassed that that made me feel good.</div><div><br/></div><div>this morning I spotted alice as we walked past each other in front of the crc. we each seemed to take a moment to recognize one another. she waved at me, I only smiled, and no words were exchanged. she was walking with someone. her boyfriend? I thought for a few moments about how much fuller of a life than mine she must live.</div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday something went wrong after I tried installing a display driver on the dell laptop, and I couldn&apos;t log in anymore because it would immediately kick me back to the user select screen. after trying every possible solution we found online, it still wouldn&apos;t work, and actually got worse this morning after it was stuck running some command all night. in the end the ops people managed to install ubuntu 16 on it, but I knew I still wouldn&apos;t enjoy working exclusively on such a shitty laptop. but I got lucky and Blessed agreed to have Anthony buy two new macbooks, one each for me and Ben. I don&apos;t want to celebrate early because there&apos;s a significant change that they&apos;ll change their minds again. work is looking very busy for the next few weeks, and I have a lot to learn.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">11-17 s</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>interestingly I just got back from a date that lasted over seven hours. after fighting traffic to and from the lenox mall to pick up a $20 apple cable. I thought Shelly was cute, and I was again able to just relax. I take it as a good sign that she felt comfortable enough with me to go on a bird ride throughout piedmont park, get in my car to move it to my workplace parking garage, sit with me in insane traffic through atlantic station (where I let her play pink from my spotify, and where we got lucky and happened to see most of a fireworks show from where we were sitting), and invite me inside her apartment building and up to her bedroom. she was quite self-conscious of how messy it was, and started hiding her bras. her building is still under construction, but there were amenities everywhere; a ton of 10th-floor poolside furniture, brand new gym equipment, fully furnished units. I just hope I didn&apos;t turn her off too much with the crazy awkwardness I introduced at the end when were saying good-bye, where I didn&apos;t know whether to hug or kiss her cheek, and couldn&apos;t tell what she wanted. in the end we just self-consciously hugged several times, some with our faces touching. her teeth are stained noticeably dark, maybe from her foreign diet.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">11-22 r</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;ve passed up several opportunities to start writing on this entry. thanksgiving totally pounced on me this year, with just about no buildup at all. I successfully found a bird (there were a lot nearby this time) and rode it to the marta station. the woman standing at the kiosk next to me was crying as she bought her ticket, and I inadvertently say near her on the train. the woman sitting next to me on the plane was snapchatting? incessantly, taking selfie after selfie, her phone brightening the screen as a flash. Shelly hadn&apos;t returned my text all day, answering only once at the airport and then nothing else until after I landed in NJ. I felt myself becoming anxious; I&apos;m falling down the rabbit hole with her. she ended up calling me as I was walking off the plane, but we only talked for two minutes and my voice could hardly go any lower as I was so conscious of the people around me.</div><div><br/></div><div>then, I&apos;d been sitting at home, where my brother already was with his Jill, whom I met earlier this year. the two of them must be quite compatible if she&apos;s staying here, but I&apos;m not with her.</div><div><br/></div><div>this morning I FaceTimed with Shelly for about an hour and a half. the current hurdle with me is finding the sweet spot between hiding my insecurities while remaining authentic. dorothy said that Shelly may have been asking about my history to check that I&apos;m not a player. but I still don&apos;t know how to gracefully handle that sort of reveal at all. she was in bed, and I in turn was laying down in my own bed too. I tried to remain quiet so my parents wouldn&apos;t hear me talking to anyone. it didn&apos;t feel strange for me to be talking to her while I was at home, because I was too preoccupied with answering her questions. she suggested visiting me up here for christmas, but I know that&apos;s something that can&apos;t happen. I wonder if there exists a past version of myself that would have been excited.</div><div><br/></div><div>currently, the standard party is being hosted at our house, and the guests poured in almost all at once. Lisa, Charles, Clark, that Jessie, and a trio of girls who I think were here last year too. nearly everyone is on their own device(s) and eating, but I&apos;m not hungry.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>Shelly called me once again in the middle of my so-called party. I&apos;m continuously surprised that she&apos;s willing to talk to me, and I&apos;m worried that my negative self-confidence will eventually cause me to collapse. I can&apos;t keep blanking out on her like this. she wants to see the fantastic beasts movie when I get back.</div><div><br/></div><div>I also actually tried to talk to one of the girls here, but the attempt was so pitiful that it doesn&apos;t count as any kind of success. I know I&apos;ve seen her before, but assumed it was here at a previous party, but she said she hasn&apos;t been here before and then I didn&apos;t know what to do. the action conflicted so much with my internalizations that I felt myself starting to blush. I didn&apos;t hear her name clearly, but her jacket has &apos;Samantha&apos; on it so I guess that&apos;s it. I ended up resigning to sitting on the couch, on my phone. joining the ranks of Charles and Clark.</div><div><br/></div><div>Charles&apos;s mom was excited to see me as usual, and I gave a nondescript answer when she asked me if I have a girlfriend this time. she didn&apos;t wait for me to elaborate or anything, but guessed yes because of my workouts. and also because of the almost flirtatious manner with which I can talk to her, because she&apos;s bubbly and there&apos;s zero pressure there.</div><div><br/></div><div>nearly all of them have left to go shopping at places. interestingly, the Samantha looked at me several times while they were all preparing to leave, and waved at me as she went out the door. it&apos;s inevitable that I&apos;m reading too much into it, and I always have to acknowledge that, but I can&apos;t help noticing her. maybe next year?</div><div><br/></div><div>Charles has been wearing big headphones, watching masterchef on his ipad while playing something on his 2ds. Clark is playing a pokemon game (leaf green?) on his laptop via a gameboy advance emulator.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">11-23 f</span></div><div><br/></div><div>a rather uneventful black friday. i didn’t buy much, and yet my paycheck this month is stretched to the max.</div><div><br/></div><div>last night shelly called me as she was walking to a marta station at night by herself. she picked up my concern over that and told me that I’m nice. she was there to take a train to a station up north to meet with her friends, to go shopping. this morning she asked me to call her again, and we talked for a while. apparently she had been out all night and had only just gotten back. I said I would call her again at noon, and I did, and we facetimed for another hour almost. so apparently the reason she thought I seemed gay was because of how tight my clothes are. but she did point out to me that my ass looks nice in my pants.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">11-27 t</span></div><div><br/></div><div>I have to consciously remember that this morning I was lying in bed with shelly, in her room. despite everything that&apos;s happened, I feel like I&apos;m incapable of processing any of it thoroughly. like something is just blocking me completely.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;ve already waited an entire week now to write anything about my time with shelly last tuesday. when I picked her up from her building&apos;s parking garage and we ended up eating at pho dai loi 2 after I realized/remembered that northern china eatery was closed. she was wearing a tan turtleneck sweater. afterwards we went to tea top. I paid for the dinner, she paid for her own tea. I first started escalating physically while we were walking around the h-mart next door. I also started sneaking in small bits of chinese while we were talking. she told me my chinese is good. she asked if she could come over to help me pack, as I&apos;d be leaving for nj for thanksgiving the next day. I showed her my place, and we sat on the couch and talked. she soon had her head resting in my lap and arms as I talked about ACF and how I listen to/organize my music, playing various songs from previous years on spotify. she directly addressed my awkwardness from saturday, and attempted to demonstrate what she had done to hug me; I put my arms around her, and as I transitioned from having my cheek against hers to my lips against her lips, I really felt how much easier and more natural it felt to be kissing her than it was kissing Jordan. we made out on the couch for a while and I ended up inviting her to stay the night. my started started bleeding for a little bit, but I felt calm and didn&apos;t freak out. I took a shower, because I have to before bed, leaving her alone in my living room with my computer unlocked. I brought out a second pillow from my closet</div><div><br/></div><div>and that&apos;s how I had a girl sleep with me in my bed for the first time. of course things went further under the covers, but I couldn&apos;t stop the anxiety from kicking in here, first as I had trouble unhooking her bra. she made a comment about me being a virgin, but I wasn&apos;t sure if she truly recognized that, or if it was kind of a joke, because I laughed it off. she repeatedly asked me about how many previous partners I&apos;ve had, and I didn&apos;t know how to answer. because I didn&apos;t want to say zero, but saying one in reference to Jordan would have felt like cheating, and I didn&apos;t want to lie in any case. I did manage to get her bra off eventually, and so I had a girl topless with me for the first time. she climbed on top of me; later I mounted her, but instead of being to take in the fact that I had a beautiful girl nearly naked in my bed, I was soft and anxious, a turmoil of unrecognizable emotions furiously swirling in my mind. I had a lot of trouble falling asleep, partly because the heat of two bodies under the covers was unbearable, and we both sweat a lot. when morning came, we kissed some more before getting up and eventually leaving. I took her to the nearby chick fil a and bought her breakfast. I conspicuously engaged in some pda that didn&apos;t feel 100% natural. I felt like one of those asian couples I used to see in college, always all over each other and no one else.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m sad about this absence of disbelief, about how something so significant has finally happened to me, and yet I feel nothing. nothing but continued underlying anxiety, anxiety about inadequacy and the general sense that something must be wrong for these good things to be happening. I remember wanting to fall asleep and wake up not remembering that she was lying next to me, but that didn&apos;t happen because of how acutely aware of it I was the whole time. that and her persistent personal questions about my history.</div><div><br/></div><div>(we talk on the phone and facetime throughout my thanksgiving weekend)</div><div><br/></div><div>I arrived back yesterday about two hours late for work. I didn&apos;t like it after all, having to get up early in the morning and scrambling to work just hours later the very same day. in the middle of the day, shelly inexplicably said she&apos;d be busy all week studying and wouldn&apos;t be able to meet up, despite having agreed to see each other on tuesday (today). as I said to dorothy, I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m somehow good at this game, or if her moves are just so transparent, because I easily played it cool (&quot;blase&quot;) and she admitted that she still wanted to see me. so I ended up walking to her apartment after leaving the office, where we went from her room to ray&apos;s pizza in tech square and back to her room. there we tried setting up her new iphone xs that she bought for some reason, apparently after some kind of misunderstanding with an apple store employee who thought she wanted to buy one. while backing up her iphone 6s with itunes, we lay in her bed making out some more. at one point I took my glasses off and turned off the light. I was able to unhook her bra a little more quickly this time. things happened, we ended up with our pants off. more things, and we were naked in bed together. for my first time ever, and nothing. not much physical, even less emotional. one of the most depressing realizations I&apos;ve ever had. I paid too much attention to how hard I was able to stay, and even while she was moaning that she wanted me, while I was fingering her, I just couldn&apos;t feel anything.</div><div><br/></div><div>even though I was comfortable showering with her, comfortable enough to change my mind about going home and sleeping over at her place instead. thinking about her throughout the day started to make me almost sick. I&apos;m hoping it was because I had to skip breakfast to get to work on time and thus was starving. because things with shelly have been progressing so quickly. this was only my third time meeting her and it almost feels like we&apos;ve been a couple for a while already. maybe this is more normal for her? she definitely has prior experience, and perhaps the people she&apos;s been with previously are more acclimated to these activities than I am. I have no idea if what I&apos;m doing is right or not. she already looks different from when I first met her just over a week ago. it feels so much longer. I haven&apos;t even had the time to get to want her. she&apos;s basically giving herself to me. telling me she wants to see me, always leaning up against me, kissing, so much kissing. this is&nbsp;&nbsp;*exactly* what I&apos;ve wanted for so, so unbelievably long. I&apos;m not even sure if this is a normal amount of work to have to put into such a thing. I feel like it&apos;s just been dumb luck, with not much pursuit necessary. I&apos;m having tremendous trouble articulating how I&apos;m feeling, and it makes sense that I would be, because I don&apos;t understand these feelings. I could easily lose my virginity to her soon, but I&apos;m not excited about it, just scared. I don&apos;t know if either she or dorothy realizes that I&apos;m still a virgin. I don&apos;t know who to talk to.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">11-28 w</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>these disruptions in my routines have me in a perpetual scramble. my life is anything but simple and it&apos;s stressing me out.</div><div><br/></div><div>things I want to jot down. a sincere conversation with Ben yesterday about the roles religion has played in our lives. I never told him about my &quot;cult&quot; experience. Blessed told me today that he was proud of me for the changes I wrote to the codebase today. since the functions we&apos;re working on parallel the work I had previously done on the apk, I have a much clearer understanding of what needs to be done and can see how complex everything is for functions that seem simple. and it&apos;s all bullshit. even though I feel like I got some things done, I also feel that it&apos;s nothing significant or meaningful.</div><div><br/></div><div>Shelly and I went this day without seeing each other, and I have to be careful because I don&apos;t want her to think that I&apos;m feeling something I&apos;m not. if I allow her into my life, it&apos;s going to tear down all the delicate structure I&apos;ve built. it should be better that way, but I can&apos;t help feeling averse to the discomfort. of change.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><b>11-29 r</b></div></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>although I feel like I&apos;m at the bottom of the ladder, I&apos;d still rather be in my position than in the Gorm&apos;s or Blessed&apos;s. so much work has gone into this product we&apos;re building, which seems like such bullshit once I have a better understanding of its inner workings. this evening the two of them were struggling with a new issue relating to device communication, while Ben and I lounged around pretending to care. Blessed dismissed us. my new work laptop came in. surprisingly, it&apos;s a macbook pro with the touch bar.</div><div><br/></div><div>Shelly told me that she&apos;s sick and I wasn&apos;t entirely sure if she was just testing me to see what I would say. she&apos;s pretty transparent when I don&apos;t say what she expects/wishes. but she actually is sick, coughing and with a hoarse voice. I don&apos;t want to be inundated by her, but I also don&apos;t want her to think that I&apos;m losing interesting, or do anything that would cause her to lose interest in me.</div><div><br/></div><div>tonight I heard my neighbors having sex, for the fourth time. I keep thinking about Shelly, and how I have my own opportunity now.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><br/></div></div></en-note>      ]]>

10-01; monday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>what the fuck</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i can't think</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>school's no longer been going on for just a month, because september just ended.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i hung out with anjaly yesterday and met more people last night than i have all year. i don't remember half their names. it was she was invited me over but i who suggested &quot;so we should hang out instead [of working].&quot; but we worked too. it was only the third time i've ever seen her. one of her roommates looked like lillian. i feel like i've seen bunches of people who look like lillian. anjaly had said she wanted to go to the library. it was past midnight by now. i hadn't started working this late since last fall, with lisa. then instead she suggested we go over to her friends' apartment instead, where i met most of them. they were all asian guys. i was worried that i would've been just a tag-along but she seemed really cool and also seemed to not want me to leave, which i did at 3am. i hope to see her again soon.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>before that i made an impromptu decision to go to grace midtown for the first time this semester when i saw a post david made in the intervarsity facebook group. it rained. we drove there with nick, jared, and one guy named andrew who i hadn't talked to before. i still haven't talked to him. i had to sit next to him in church, at the end of our row of 5, and kept looking over at him during worship. he seemed bored. none of us lifted our hands in the air. everyone else in the building seemed to. i haven't seen such heated worship in a long time. ACF is nothing compared to this. it made me want to lift my hands in the air and pray hard because everyone else was doing it. i thought about conformity a lot. no one in our group was raising hands, so i didn't want to either. at one point the worship leader guy told everyone to hold the hands of the people next to us so i had to hold andrew's hand. ugh. my arm got tired. i got tired of the emotionlessness. people all around me (or all in front of me, rather, we were in a corner) were emphatically shouting yes and amen and clapping and all i felt was immense confusion. for some moments i felt twinges of a type of 'it won't be so bad' or 'it won't be so hard' when i thought about retrying following god the way i used to try. doused whenever the speaker would speak in a preachy fashion, saying things about this god's infinite love and power and grace. i still don't know what it all means. i tried praying again, and hated it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now today i'm sitting next to eric in the culc, who i didn't greet. sam and mike came up the stairs and didn't walk over to me. fuck them. i'm going to hate relying on sam for our cs design project. i'm going to loathe it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>what does my voice sound like?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>audrey walked past and waved, like she always did.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the barcelona reunion is today. i'm refusing a group meeting to go to it. i wonder if it will be worth it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>that AWA thing is over, that melissa had always been fussing about. i hope it will be easier to see her now.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i sometimes question my approach, but have not yet thought up any alternatives. i want oh shit is that the justin kid coming down the stairs? yes it was him. i've only known where i want my life to go in vague terms, namely color, free air, smoothness, cleanliness, i draw something like dopamine from persistent perfectionist illusions. distortions, the devil's son that clouds and is the reason i can't look into my future. i have to look quite hard at my diamond present to realize, no! this isn't what i want. but then the smoke gets me, every time. asphyxia. ah. i think the fog is safer than it really is. i might be pulling a wcw here. none but the king may read this in english (this is written, believe it or not, in english). you don't know what the fuck i'm talking about. as far as i'm concerned, v is the last of his kind in my book, but invaluable still and indispensable, irreplaceable and for now he remains a good, if not very, friend. he's in london. how can i like him when he's so frustrating sometimes? ~</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
10-02; tuesday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i wonder if i can be an unpleasant person at times. maybe trying to emulate marie isn't such a good idea. i'm not very good at it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i went to the bcn reunion after happening upon corrigan. he was nice. i didn't talk to tyler there. sidney gave me a hug, and i didn't talk to anyone i never talk to like anna and rita. patrick and i have very little to talk about. people mentioned another upcoming &quot;unofficial&quot; reunion, but i'm getting less and less excited at the thought, i think.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>when i met with sally she said i looked happy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i arrived at my room to find a lego big ben architecture set sitting at my door. &quot;from sam and mike-o.&quot; more of me not giving credit where it was Due. it was a belated birthday present, but oddly exactly what i was expecting as a present from them..they still 'love' more than i do. i am unpleasantly selective after all.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last year one of my small group applications had been to look at everyone i see and smile. that would include people i recognized but didn't know well. i've been more withdrawn than usual, noticing instances again and again where i'm avoiding people instead of trying to get them to see me. when did this happen?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>WORDS I HATE: awkward</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lisa wants to have lunch me again, hm. even she likes me more than i like her. well, maybe i can try again.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>SCENARIO: this came into my head a few days ago, and i'm not sure what it means, maybe i should ask an english teacher. a guy is driving through an empty desert in his pickup truck. maybe a small rv. i want an rv because then there can be empty cabinets and things. the point is, he's empty. his fuel gauge reads E. he might have several red gasoline containers, all of which are empty too. then something will happen, maybe he passes out. that's actually a good idea, rather than some kind of weird abstract colorful flash transition, or hallucination or whatevs. then he'll find himself in a lush forest. perhaps combined with city. everything will be abstract some more, and more important empty too. but not exhaustedly-empty, more like a waiting-empty. like it's ready for something, primed, set up. he'll get excited because he'll have understand something. the city-forest is not yet in his reach, but [cut to the desert again]. he'll wake up, find his truck, and this time his fuel gauge will read F and he'll drive off. should there be dialogue? what would he say. everything he says will be either to himself or to god.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>what's something that kills me</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>another</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>SCENARIO: this one i came up with over the summer, and it's cheesy. it details a boy and a girl in love who both know that in a year one of them will fall out of love. permanently. forever. no chance of coming back. and they decide to continue anyway. what would happen.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm waiting for melissa to say something. i have to know she's interested in hanging out with me too. before i even think about it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>wow i get absorbed. it's been a little less than an hour since i got here. and everything seemed to freeze. everything around me feels less real for a while..i'd like to go out for a nice deliberate walk. i wish i could live in new york city. someone said that if i really want to live there, she has all the faith in the world that i'll get myself there one day.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i signed up to go to the oie study abroad fair on thursday, but am half expecting to end up shying out of going. that probably means i won't go, because having the tiniest bit of doubt means it is guaranteed to end up swallowing me and bar me from getting anywhere. that's the why it usually works on me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i didn't get the crc job. i think it was just because of my horrible interview. it makes me really hate this world.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>WORDS I HATE: interview</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i've been drinking less water and more starbucks.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>walked into mike while en route to ULC and i was really happy to see him, i don't know why. i really don't know why..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the way sam says daaaan whenever he comes back to the room is somewhat irksome. i never respond. and he doesn't usually walk up to my door. ~</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>my involvement in the databases project is a big contrast from what i'd done in my past group project classes, like the oregon trail one. i basically thought, so this is how it feels to actually (i don't want to use the word 'participate') think up and do things. i hope i can deliver, because my partners claim to not know much about what they're doing sometimes. i've been such a bad group worker in the past. i might know why that is/was. it might be because i didn't know any of my teammates and don't like talking to people i don't know.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hayson and i never talk to each other now. he always stays on his laptop during our math class all the time. then when class is over we say bye. and he walks away dragging his roller backpack along. he's interesting, i thought.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i talked with steph for a few minutes. i sat down with her. i've come a long way, i want to say.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking about david's small group tonight this time comes with the smallest bit of excitement at seeing christina, which isn't full-fledged. while walking down stairs this morning i suddenly remembered mike talking about possibly visiting legoland over fall break, and i think..christina..was also interested he told me</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>also because of small group i was going to walk back but i hate sitting in my room. maybe i should log just how much time i spend in areas i always say i hate.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>some things to start trying more often are &quot;sayi ~</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>swimming yesterday made me superlazy and my Bad thought process went something like this, since i already missed a day i might as well just skip another, meh. because i forgot to finish writing on wednesday.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>after wednesday's small group i tagged with david and allison to mcdonald's. they talked about girls farting and allison asked me if i know mike sandt. i meant to ask hannah if she could give me a haircut, but she left early. it should have been an opportunity, because i thought i wasn't going to see her until next friday. now i Am not going to see her until next friday.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i woke early on thursday morning for a second webex meeting. it ended and i got a chick fil-a breakfast, which i haven't had for [ever]. then i got an iced coffee from starbucks, repeating to the barista what i had heard someone else say a few days ago. i'd never ordered any actual coffee before. made my way to the study abroad fair in the student center, but the only person there was a certain daniel, one of the people who i had gone drinking with on my first barcelona day. he didn't remember me, because he had been to the city several times and met tech students in the program every time. i saw sabir for the first time since the summer there too. the first thing i said to him was &quot;where is everybody?&quot; and that was mostly it. one of the daniel's friends stopped by (he seemed quite familiar) and sabir and them two were the ones getting people to sign up for information sessions. sabir started to talking to someone else and then when people came to ask about the program he directed them to one of those two, instead of me even though he'd make a split-second eye contact with me. it was saddening. no one else i knew was there. to talk about bcn i mean; i saw marie and she hugged me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my mom kept telling me to go to the farmer's market so i did but didn't buy anything. after databases sally suggested i get a burger from a guy that sold burgers made with meat that came from &quot;grass-fed&quot; animals, but right as i walked up to his truck and she left the guy wrote 'sold out' on his sign.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i finally met my two group mates in psyc. jenni is loud and brandon seems a little bit lazy. i didn't talk much. jenni seems okay.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i meant to deposit the check but said to cash it instead and never told the teller oh wait a minute i meant deposit so i'm left with $229 in cash.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i tried diving into the pool. i couldn't tell how smoothly i entered the water. mike said it was good, but of course he's not a reliable judge of that.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i finished my bottle of vodka that night, while talking to patrick again. he seriously likes drinking and seems to love it when i'm drinking too. he also missed barcelona a lot more than i realized. i had about a third of a liter, and went to bed drunk.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>unsurprisingly, lisa didn't call me for lunch until 1pm. i saw gabe and gabe saw me and so it was the three of us eating for about 15 minutes. he stuck to his phone and didn't talk a lot. also didn't know lisa and i know each other. and as per usual i didn't know how to respond to half the things she said. we talked about subway while she walked me almost to class. she didn't want to walk up the stairs.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ACF people will be leaving for the 40 soon. yesterday mike asked me who i'm riding with. he assumed i was going, but i never told anyone whether i was going or not. i told him i'm not going, and he didn't ask me why. so i won't be with them this weekend. i'll have two days to think up an excuse as to why i didn't go, to spit at people who ask. inevitably steph, who i can imagine (barely) berating me for it and then running off to other people, having never really cared. i have no way of knowing if i'll regret it. it's easy to imagine that the fun parts will hardly qualify as fun at all, and anything that's not &quot;fun&quot; will be miserable. i still just can't find whatever i'm looking for in this crowd of people.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>nevertheless if i were to go, afterwards i would be glad that i did. for now, i don't really care about what's happening tomorrow and sunday. ~</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>i still don't quite understand what made everyone in barcelona think my writing was so good. i guess my writer's voice just sounds like what i talk to myself in my head with all the time, so it doesn't sound like anything special. i've been looking out for it in stuff i write nowadays. i think i just sound like a fool.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i've been biting my nails a Lot.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my room's kitchen depresses me. i hate standing in it. our counter tops and tabletops are dirty and i've only tried cleaning the table once before deciding it would be hopeless. going to buy some plastic utensils, paper plates, and maybe even paper cups so i won't have to deal with washing my lone metal fork and knife and spoon with a sponge that's probably dirty in the dirty sink. ~</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
10-07; sunday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>standing in the kitchen just evokes this strange sense of hopelessness. things like that are making me wonder how big an improvement my life now is over last year. last year was absolutely miserable.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>christina is a negative, and anjaly and melissa are only just maybes. i didn't want to sit completely idly so i decided to text anjaly because simply why not. i'd forgotten that i hated keeping up forced text conversations, and i had decided a while ago that texting isn't for simply talking. i guess she thinks that too, because she died down. i was just thinking she seems like a nice person so why not try to talk to her more. meanwhile melisssa. i don't know where she is. i haven't seen her online on facebook at all this past week. where is someone who i can be loose and happy around? it certainly isn't me.</div>

<hr/>
10-08; monday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i have to find the right words for this before it becomes too late and i slack.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i have no definitive self. i've said that if i was an alien i'd be the thing. for those of you who don't know, i meant to refer to the 1982 movie, whose primary antagonist is a parasitic extraterrestrial lifeform that assimilates other organisms and in turn imitates them. i became sure of it this summer, when i hung around the barcelona kids and became one of them. i didn't do anything unimaginable, but did things i thought i'd never do, and i only thought i'd never do them because of my previous crowd(s).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>which leads me to wonder how people like dan fitzgerald and monique are as resilient as they are.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and when first introduced to ACF, i tried to assimilate It.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this is about god again. bottom line is that i still don't understand him (or jesus or anything else about any other religion) and i don't think i ever will. i know now that i only tried so hard to 'follow' because everyone around me was. many of them have been enveloped in it their whole lives..they knew what they were doing, and i pretended to know too. i wanted to. i wanted to so badly, because i wanted them. i thought i would have things..life, idk..figured out this way, but i never came close to getting anything straight. the whole time i deceived myself and thought i was finally on the right track when i was merely conforming..none of it ever got me anywhere and i didn't know why i was getting nowhere because it all seemed to be working so well for everyone else. words that shook them and made them cry only confused me, because of the dissonance between the apparent virtue they held for them and their meaninglessness to me. it doesn't fit, it never fit. i could feel it when around my parents and friends outside ACF, and always tried to ignore it. i might've been a bigger hypocrite last year than i am now, last year when i paraded my smiling self around them as a member while inside our hearts were never on the same page. none of it ever made the slightest bit of sense to me..i guess the fact that i can't mold myself around this means that it's not for me. all the times when i was nodding alongside everybody else and said yes and said amen with them..i was lying. to everyone.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the only thing i've done to myself is knock any belief i had further into a state of limbo..i tore myself up by pushing my heart and mind in opposite directions. i'm more conflicted than ever and i can't be satisfied now without him or 'with' him. i have never known god, and nor do i want to, but there are things he knows that i can never question without calling on him.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i hope this is the last time i'll ever talk about this shit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my heart doesn't work (doesn't work meaning i'm not emotional and never cry and never feel anything emotional) because i never use it. i've been thinking about melissa sometimes, and more recently anjaly, and wondering exactly how much more interested i am in hanging out with them than they are with me. how hard can it be to find someone you can be around often enough? yes i've thought that maybe i shouldn't blindly refuse to look at anyone in ACF just because they're in ACF, but none of them meet the be-around-them-often-enough requirement anyway.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>huh. elizabeth fowler just walked by the window. i guess most people walk by themselves after all.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i met hayson while walking around before class and he took a big roundabout way through the culc and library to get to skiles just because he didn't want to climb up stairs. there are by no means an overwhelming number of stairs up to skiles. i don't understand..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i missed an opportunity to say yes when i didn't take up an offer to register to vote, which even mike sandt did. he showed me when we met outside the classroom. we actually had a conversation and he sat next to me. this is only anything more than no deal at all because we usually don't acknowledge each other.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>:gap:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>people may be starting to receive the sense of animosity i'm starting to give off. i forgot who i had in mind..after i wrote that sentence but i was also thinking of enoch and how i highly doubt we'll ever be going out for frozen yogurt like we did last spring. after our group meeting today i left without saying bye to any of them, including sam. i'm regressing into the mood i was temporarily afflicted with last spring where i didn't want to smile around or talk to him. now i never really want to talk to him much..except he's the only one who'll be able to help me with my parts of the cs design project. and like it or not he's more experienced than me and knows more than me, something that i won't be able to change without trying..so i'll have to work if i want to make sure i can surpass and stay above him. best revenge is living well, right..?</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm ranting about my loneliness right now to a couple people who i don't expect to get any useful advice or motivation from. sometimes i feel like the kind of person someone would casually mention without a second thought in a conversation, a so-and-so who was always moping around and never had friends and always instead caught up in blah blah blah. maybe this hypothetical someone would also know what my problem is, has been, will be. wish i could ask.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>isn't everyone supposed to have those one or two people who they're always hanging around? like a ron and hermione. i don't have that.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i think this friday i'm going to hug someone like mike (it might have to be a guy) and see how it makes me feel. any happier, lighter? i don't think it will but i can give it a chance. maybe i can drink some malibu so it would be easier.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>:gap:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>people today: david stolarsky near the culc. i had to glance at him like 4 times and he kept glancing at me too because i wasn't sure if it was him. i think i saw anna at starbucks, who also kind of just glanced at me before walking off. dani in the student center, with whom i had one of the most forced conversations of my life. it was embarrassing. kelly is sitting next to me in starbucks now after barely glancing at me and not really saying hi. i don't care, but i'm surprised. i think.</div>

<div>melissa says sorry a Lot.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i saw monique again and the two people with her turned out to be alex and hannah, so disappointing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i don't like studying at starbucks anymore. can't get over the idea of walking over and sitting down, spreading my stuff and papers on the table while always deciding if i should go buy another pumpkin spice latte. i don't like it (that idea).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>there are only a handful of songs remaining that still evoke good memories of barcelona. pretty much only regina spektor. i'll hold off listening to 'far' so i can preserve that emotional tie for as long as i can. ironic because then i won't get to hear the music.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night all that tom would say in response to my ranting/venting are one word answers like &quot;aww&quot; or a single stupid emoticon. unhelpful as ever.</div>

10-10; wednesday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so disgusted was i that i ended up deactivating my facebook account right then and now.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>went over to david's, after deciding to complain to him about never seeing anybody, and did virtually nothing. he did make a point during our conversation when he said that i never ask him to do anything. i'm afraid that hanging out with him will become less interesting soon.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i think i'm giving up on melissa for now. she's not here anyway.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>:gap:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>saw christine today. the way she talks to me is always a little refreshing, even though i don't expect it's a big deal to her. it just sounds like we know each other better than we actually do, or rather other people who i know about as well as her don't talk like she does. maybe? or idk maybe it's just because she's cute, i don't know mind collapses</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the math test went fairly well. mike and i didn't talk this time. hayson asked to borrow my pen because apparently all that he carries in his roller backpack is his laptop. i left my pen in the room because i saw him chewing on it. well it was against and probably in his mouth. poor pen.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i started reading sylvia plath's 'the bell jar'. gabe came and we talked for a minute. i probably should stop treating conversations with him so gingerly, as if i'm not expecting him to take anything i saw seriously and vice versa. he said some famous youtube people would be visiting the school today, and there seemed to be some people waiting around when i left. later during small group christina confirmed it when she talked about it too. david and i didn't really give a shit, and we were the only two in the room who don't think ryan higa is funny. then again david doesn't seem to care for much for anything, something that seems to manifest every time we hang out, that he just doesn't find much interesting or exciting. he states it rather broadly too.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>christina seemed quite offended when i called david &quot;dumb&quot; when he talked about tests he'd failed in the past. she immediately went defensive and proclaimed a &quot;you're not dumb david! you probably just didn't have time to study!&quot; and i found that i couldn't look at her. hannah and allison gasped too. i don't know if the bigger reason for their reactions was the fact that they're girls, but i was thinking lighten the fuck up.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>more generic applications. that i'm cynically thinking everyone will leave un-carried out again. we went in a circle talking about the things we set for ourselves to do last week, and all i remember is all of them saying that they didn't read scripture. all they seem to want to do is read scripture, and they're just never able to keep it up. i myself can't see it is anything other than an obligation that's going to become unenjoyable by the end of the week. they excuse themselves by bringing up tests and work, which is very valid and reasonable, but at the same time i swear they all also claim to try to not let schoolwork get in the way. and school always wins.</div>

<div>i'm ready for my shitty fall break now. the campus is empty, everywhere is closed, and i'm about to blow $25 on more chinese food.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on thursday i saw chris julian at chick fil-a. he said i'm one of the people he sees most, which i didn't follow because i could only recall seeing him twice. john dugan walked by and chris flagged him down. they both said they'd like to hang out. john seemed to not have m in the picture for a moment until he markedly included me too.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday was friday. at ACF as i listened to enoch talk i kept trying to figure out ways to keep god out of the picture we was presenting. his message was rather thought provoking and you don't need to know god at all to take it in, so i ignored the whole god part because it was substance-less and meaningless to me and i couldn't see it. his topic was 'faith in films' and the film he related to was '50 first dates' which we didn't even watch because they're all so averse to swear words they won't even let us see a clip where one is said out loud. i don't think i said a word to enoch. i squeezed his arm though, which i meant as a sign of friendliness but afterwards i wished i hadn't. yan said hi to me but that was it. i didn't feel like trying to talk to anyone. even back when i did want to talk to people, i didn't. i guess i really looked sad because hannah asked me why i looked so sad, and i couldn't think of anything to do but smile at her..gosh i'm so stupid. i keep hoping i'll have more to say when i hang out with melissa. the vietnamese restaurant we planned to eat at turned out to be out of business and they all failed at coordinating and finding us another place so our different cars ended up at different restaurants. i ate at one called mellow mushroom and the pizza was pretty good. still didn't talk to anyone while eating. i feel retarded whenever steph and i make eye contact because all we do is just stupidly stare at each other for five seconds. helen is nice, in a very useless sort of way. in the car tam played more shitty asian pop songs that everyone else somehow knows. back at ULC helen took a slightly roundabout way to a back entrance just because she &quot;do[es]n't like inclines.&quot; what the fuck?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i didn't play volleyball with all of them, and no one asked me to. i saw them at curran while i was doing my laundry. they're all so happy. i'm starting to think i've never tasted pure happy. i haven't been letting myself anywhere near it. when i was after it though, i never got it either. fuck.</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>'requiem for a dream' is one of the most beautiful movies i've ever seen. movies that paint a small but real and vivid slice of the world so well with amazing music. and it's depressing. so i like it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i only know two songs by fun. and they are 'some nights' and 'we are young'. they both make me think of new york. 'some nights' never really got the chance to become associated with the night at the bar in rome in my head.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>patrick seems less interested in talking to me now. if he goes that would put the number of people from barcelona that i still talk to at 0.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>melissa is also an awful online chat partner. and notoriously slow texter.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>:gap:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i could only keep my facebook deactivated for 3 days before i wanted to talk to melissa so badly i logged in again.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i was just thinking back to the i told v. about people like sam and david and how he had immediately labeled them as faggots. it really annoyed me that he said that about the people who i considered close friends, but i'm starting to switch sides. o how i had defended them. now i feel like they hold nothing to me. i'd probably still be sad if my relationships with them disintegrated, but honestly there's never been much substance to them and i see them so rarely that it probably wouldn't even matter if i never spoke to them again. i'd be fine with it as long as i'm sure i don't depend on them for anything.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i have a new plan with the lego architecture models and that is to buy the villa savoye for its separator piece and use that to help me deconstruct all of the models i have now for easier storage.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i finished 'the bell jar' by sylvia plath and i didn't really understand it. i like it at first because it seemed like simple story but towards the end i was reading just to finish it. i liked the idea of being mentally unstable though.</div>

<div>anjaly never asked to come over.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i hope melissa and i can hang out all day tomorrow.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>something i believe i could start doing is to sketch out my general dream settings whenever i'm able to recall them.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm catching myself feeding the negative, my mind is everywhere except right here, right now, i sort of feel pressured to be someone other than myself, fear is probably holding me back, i feel like i'm competing against everyone else, i feel bored, and i don't know who's writing my story.</div>

<div>melissa's always late. i almost wouldn't be surprised if she ended up canceling our plans last minute again. i want to value her, but i wouldn't feel crushed if she suddenly disappeared or stopped valuing me. maybe because i can't really tell how much she really values me now.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm such an introvert. and i'd like it, if it didn't mean i'm so lonely for so much of the time.</div>

10-16; tuesday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>these days are slowly getting colder. roommate keeps turning the a/c all the way down, but seemingly less often now. i've had a headache all weekend, and can't figure out why. it's either from the 6mg dosage of melatonin i took, which i don't think should have effects this long-lasting, or from going to sleep with my hair wet, but the past two days my hair has been barely damp when i got into bed.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i did get to see melissa yesterday. i went to clough and waited for her for around two hours. she had an errand to run, she said, and we never set a specific time anyway. the first thing she did was hug me. i was holding a pumpkin spice latte in one hand and i felt that the other arm i used to hug her back didn't quite fit around her. we found another vietnamese restaurant to eat at. she drives slowly. i had to let her pay for me because they didn't take discover and i had no cash on me, which she seemed very eager to do. i didn't want to pray before eating and i couldn't tell her that i don't do that anymore so i watched her while she prayed. she included something about the election in it. she wouldn't let me drive the way back, which disappointed me for a while, but only because i really like driving. she parked in the lot that lucky buddha is at and we walked back to clough, where i got really bored after a while because all i had to do was read tumblogs and tech blogs, which i quickly exhausted. i reinstalled braid on my computer and invited her to play, but she was so bad at it and insisted i play, so i ended up playing through the whole game while she just watched and only put the puzzle pieces together. after that we made for firehouse subs but i decided to crave lucky buddha instead and she paid for me again because they didn't take discover either. dropped me off in front of ULC after hugging me and telling me about the time she and her friend looked through a window and saw someone having sex with someone.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i thought a lot about and tried to imagine being more intimate with her, like putting an arm around her or leaning in close. i couldn't do it and found it terrifying. she put her arm around mine a lot, and leaned her head sometimes too. she thanked me superfluously for things that i never would have imagined warranted thanking. she thanked me several times for playing braid 'for her'. she suggested several horror video games, all of which are japanese and have anime-style graphics. i'm not too interested in any of them, to be honest. while we were walking back to her car she had her arm around me for a couple minutes. i was largely unresponsive to all of her gestures. i wonder if i made her sad at all. i feel like i can't be completely myself around her, that if i showed my complete unrestrained personality she would be horrified. mostly i found myself behaving awkwardly and talking very quietly, keeping most of my thoughts to myself. saying good-bye to her takes forever.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i guess that confirms that she's incompatible. and that eliminates the last of the few possible candidates i have for myself now. all possibilities negated, do not dwell, and carry on.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i read about pascal's wager in my book on philosophy, the theory that resonated with me most because i already a primitive version of it bouncing around in my brain, and i realized that my view on faith and god has become a gamble. it's simply more worth it to believe in god, because then in the worst case, in which god doesn't exist, nothing will happen to the believer. on the other hand if he does and you spend your life ignoring him you get to spend eternity in hell.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>then that of course is far from a sufficient cause to truly believe. trying to whole heartedly believe like that just because 'i want to' can never work for me. even if i want to again. i won't. because i can't.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i saw hannah yesterday and we exchanged a few stupid short words. i confirmed something else then, which is that i can't talk to any of the regular ACF people because i simply have nothing to say to them. all the times i linger around them, hoping, waiting for an opportunity at conversation to show up. but i have nothing to say to them. so to whom do i DO have anything to say? david? i'm not very sure anymore. this explains why conversations with people like steph end up being so short. i. have. nothing. to say. to them.</div>

<div>i'm one of the people i'm inwardly accusing everyone in ACF of being. i've been the person who's on his phone at group dinners, without bothering to try to converse with other people. a while ago, i remember, kelly told me she'd always be there for me. i've never ever thought about ever talking to her about anything. why? maybe if i just tried something will happen. i'm become very pessimistic though, and i think that nothing will happen because i've already tried so many times. only i've never been sure of how many times i really 'tried' or if i ever 'tried' hard enough to justify my disappointment.</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>i was scrolling through all of my phone's texts the other day and for some reason when i reached monique (the last time i texted her was on christmas last year) it occurred to me about how little my friendships with most of the ACF people have progressed. we never text. we never hang out. they're all i have, and they're supposed to be my friends? </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it feels so hopeless. how is this even supposed to work?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i added a bunch of people to my facebook acquaintances list, which removes them from my chat list and ironically leaves it filled with more people i'm unlikely to talk to since all the people i met in barcelona aren't marked as acquaintances.</div>

<div>today i recognized that urvashi is an uncommon someone that i can actually act naturally around. i managed to bump into her twice today and i also realized that i feel a little bit happier when i'm around her. she jokingly said that she was &quot;getting tired of [my] shit&quot; and that means that dropping swear words around her won't be a problem. i don't mean to isolate swear words as a way of measuring how comfortably i can talk around people, but there's always something about the ACF-ers' aversion to them that seems to hang in the back of my mind forcing me to restrain my dialogue. i can say something random or weird if it comes to mind and she wouldn't think anything of it. i think she would appreciate me for who i am. i don't have to be someone else around her, like i awkwardly have to be around melissa, for example. she told me my hands are pretty. i wish i knew more people like her.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on the trolley today i saw a girl keep looking at her phone. i think she was crying. the idea of a fresh break-up refused to unlatch itself from my mind but i wondered if her heart had just been broken by some news that had just been delivered to her and what it could be. the more i looked at her the more i felt like i had seen her somewhere before. i swear i saw a wet trail running down her cheek where a tear had rolled. looked around at everyone else on the trolley, who seemed so starkly inanimate and emotionless compared to her. she was probably trying to compose herself as more people got on the trolley..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at our courseshark design meeting i didn't say a single word and nobody (except maybe sam) looked at me once. i kept pathetically glancing at the time, hoping we would run out of it (a few of them were trying to solve some computer issue that had come up) before they asked me to show what i had worked on (i had nothing), like way back in high school when i would hope a class period would end before i had to give some presentation. i'll still have to depend on sam for the project though. i think i spoke with a normal enough level of cheer when i asked if i could catch up on material with him. made sure to not talk in the stupid soft, unconfident, riddled-with-giggles way (the mannerism that heavily reminds of that kevin, sam's friend who i first met at the aquarium last year) that i used to talk to people i once considered close.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm not resentful of the fact that there was no big dinner organized for my birthday (it would've made me uncomfortable anyway) but the facebook event now shows 19 people attending and i know i'm not going to enjoy myself there. i'll just end up sitting and eating in silence, possibly next to people i never talk to, having gone just to have my fill and then i'll wait for it all to be over so i can escape from them and their glee.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i think i'm going to pre-order dead space 3 for myself using discreetly purchased EA game cards from tech square's gamestop.</div>

<div>i didn't feel like talking during tonight's small group dinner, and i said almost nothing to anyone the whole time. christina and jane were their usual meek selves, and i thought allison was annoying just by being there. i basically only talked to david, who maybe tried once or twice to get words going but didn't know how to deal with me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday yan posted on my facebook wall telling me she found my 'random' posts amusing. earlier today urvashi described them as mysterious. i guess i'm okay with that. i want to keep posting 'cryptic' things now.</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>david probably just didn't feel like eating lunch with me so he may have planned to bail, but i guess i somehow persuaded him to stick with it. so we ate our interaction was pretty normal and unremarkable. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>anjaly keeps presenting excuses as to why she never comes, but at the same time seems persistent to keep at least this one promise. i'm sure everyone else would have dropped it. hell even i had let it go until she texted me yesterday.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i was hoping to go the whole day without seeing sam so i wouldn't have to say happy birthday to him in person, until i realized the potluck thing was to happen tonight. and they decided to change the &quot;venue&quot; to steph's room so i had to leave mine. i brought my mooncake with me. monique said i looked tired and unhappy and asked me if everything was okay. i replied in an unusually quiet voice. i helped my own brain shut down and didn't try to talk at all. sheridan ended up joining us and she recognized me. i guess she recognized me the day i first visited their room, since she knew we had met in barcelona. monique started a conversation about feces again and i showed her the 'poo genie' video i first saw on wtfjapanseriously.com and she wasn't laughing by the end of it. no one paid attention to my mooncake. david and steph started cuddling and touching each other and mike gave sam a knife as a present. why do they give each other knives? do they even know how to use them? i know i'm being ultra-cynical here, and i wouldn't know how to use such a knife either. i sat at one end of the couch and stared at the floor/out the window and when i couldn't tolerate them anymore i got up and left. the only person i made eye contact with as i walked away was sheridan.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now i'm just watching hells' kitchen in my room. i know nothing about cooking nor am i particularly interested in it, but i've always found cooking shows exciting and engaging somehow..</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>i think i hit a new low in terms of number of people i talked to at ACF. i practically forgot any of them were even there, and when someone did talk to me it almost felt weird. i stuck by david again and started using slightly harsher language. enoch's message was less applicable to me this time and made me a little uncomfortable. i don't know why i go to ACF anymore. i'm not hanging out with them this time either watching toy story 3, and fewer people, if any, miss me. i don't want to talk to anyone. </div>

10-20; saturday</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i spent the better part of the afternoon deciding whether i'd go to the birthday dinner or not. when i told v of this he said he would rather go than stay in his room and do nothing, and i thought about having to explain to everyone why i wasn't going if i decided not to, and how everyone would undoubtedly be expecting me to come, and that at the very least i'd have a nice dinner, so i went. i'm fairly glad i did, as usual i guess.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we sat through another traffic jam and i had stolen the front seat even after ritchie had called it. between then and yesterday i had listened to the music on the radio for maybe an hour total and still recognized several of the songs played. portions were tiny. i ordered croquetas, because i knew what those were from barcelona, and scallops, because i've been watching so much hell's kitchen. i had no idea of knowing how well cooked the scallops were, but they were cold and i only got 2 of them and 3 little croquetas. for 18 fucking dollars. i pulled up x-plane on my phone and handed it to ritchie and laughed at him while he tried to fly various planes. i tried taking videos, but the lighting was too low. a little live band played some music and some of us got up and danced for a bit; i had no interest in it whatsoever. steph kept asking everyone what they were getting, and then asked us all how our food was, as if she cared. at least once she asked me something, then turned away as something else snagged her attention and never got back to me. that's quite annoying when it happens. after &quot;mingling,&quot; as mike put it, for a fucking long time we went to yoforia afterwards, where i decided that i think chris yang and lousia are rather nice and tame people, and that i like them. monique said she likes me because i have no problem with how weird she is. why, of course not. on the way back david mentioned the radio station playing only club music at night on saturday and steph said something like &quot;so we can all party in the car.&quot; it occurred to me that neither she nor any other of our immediate circle of friends have done anything resembling hard partying or clubbing and that she probably has no idea what she's talking about. i'm a little afraid i'm going to end up making all subsequent judgements based on this little inkling. david dropped off helen, steph, and her friend joanne in front of the ULC, and i stayed in the car because i didn't want to walk with them. i know how i would have felt strolling alongside them, and it makes me want to vomit. steph and joanne have a tent set up in her apartment's living room because they wanted to go sort of &quot;camping.&quot; excuse me, but how fucking retarded is that? while talking with david i almost said that i'd be whole if i would be content knowing the world would end soon, but i never managed to deliver the line; instead we started talking about cars when i saw an audi r8 in the crc parking lot.</div>

<div>DISGUST: stalking, creepy, awkward, interview, internship</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i thought i saw, but wasn't sure, christina when going down student center stairs, and i was right, it was her. then i heard sam up ahead and he was there and so was christina, ritchie, and diana. christina asked me if i said hi to her when i saw her. so she recognized me, and didn't stop or slow down whatsoever or wave or anything at me, and she asked if i said hi to her just then? what the fuck, seriously. she told everyone that saying hi to people was my small group application, and later on when we were eating and i was thinking about how talking to diana was usually quite easy, it occurred to me that there'd probably be no such conversing if i was alone with christina, and that when she addressed me about my application, she was really talking to everybody else. everyone was kinda pissing me off by doing nothing, like talking about stupid shit, stupidly nodding at me, and asking me useless questions like when i had class; i know they couldn't care less.</div>

<div>these days i go to starbucks sometimes without thinking about it at all. i swear i have no idea what i'm doing. i get in line barely considering whether i really want to be in it or not, i sit at the table with no work in mind. drink a pumpkin spice latte and eat a coffee cake. fire music up and try to detach my brain from its stem and set it adrift in a pathetic fantasy world. CHECK. FUCKING. FACEBOOK.</div>

<div>i do not have a close relationship with my family, particularly my dad, but when he sent me a test this weekend reading &quot;No time to speak to ur daddy?:)&quot; it hit me a little hard. mom and dad wanted to talk to me over the weekend and i basically ignored all of their requests. i just checked my call history and we haven't talked in 2 and a half weeks.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm going through another down phase where i don't want anyone that i know here to be close to me. if only i could gather and maintain a RESOLVE!</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>we've gone nowhere in the past two fucking years, i thought. it happened with jessie, it happened with (sam?), it's happening with this girl right now in front of me. she wants me to talk louder. as a matter of fact just now i promised her i'd write 1000 words for her, an idea i'd been turning over in my head moments earlier. this gum is getting bitter. it's peppermint, and i had pack of 15 and this is the only one that's tasted bitter so far. my mouth is dry. not form talking, but from not talking. i thought i had failed an initiative, and for a while i was tottering dangerously on angry, with a pinch of miserable and failure. positivity in that she was a little excited when i told her i was writing what i was thinking, almost a stream of consciousness type. i came up with 4 ways she's better than me, probably as a person. she's been laying on a bench staring for over ten minutes now and while i stared at the ground and watched a negativity see i planted there blossom. from its branches i picked out all the ripest ways i'm wrong and incomplete, and ate them down to the core. then i kept them. 1000 words by this weekend. haha, okay. that's no problem. i used to manufacture 750 a day! in a single day! now and then i'm phasing in my typing to think up new things to type, not really new things but things i'm newly aware of thinking, and i'm wishing i could stay in this almost meditative state forever and sit here typing for a long long time, not having to worry about remembering everything because if it's not in my mind anymore, it'll be on my solid state drive, which doesn't matter nearly as much, what in the HELL is going on?! this writing while the screen is off thing is a nice idea. i really like it. it's just, i hate my voice though STOP.</div>

<div>i told anjaly i'd write this, and it's not going to be specifically for her, but i do have an audience to keep in mind for now. yesterday she came at my pandora's box with a crowbar, and it blew up in my face. time time time has passed since anyone else has knocked, and i've forgotten what the hollow pounding feels like tearing through this stupid skull of mine. a star was born yesterday. but suns die too. i get really scared when stars are born.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i talked to patrick yesterday. i need him to get more liquor for me. if i'm not able to go to the halloween party with him, then i won't be going to any party anywhere.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i think i'm the most poisonous person i know. everyone around me pales in comparison. i've only wanted to be what everybody else wants to be also, someone whose existence doesn't really matter because it doesn't help anyone. there can be no more accusations, labeling, dismissing, or scoffing, because i'm the one who deserves it most. come to think of it, it's a wonder anyone who's ever held my hand has actually done so. i grow increasingly disgusted the longer i stare at myself in the mirror.</div>

<div>i was talking to anjaly yesterday the same way i remember talking to jessie over one and a half years ago. i regress into this toned down super meek self that speaks so quietly even i wonder how they can hear me when they do. i become self conscious of every movement i make, without the stupid accompanying whir of course. it makes me feel so substanceless. i have to care not about the things not worth caring about. i'll be emulating her, assimilating her. maybe it'll make me feel more whole. i'm denying myself the components i need.</div>

<div>lee texted me today. almost two years have gone by since we last saw or talked to each other, and an unexpected text turned out to be his..my inner reaction was mostly a curt &quot;cool&quot; instead of any kind of &quot;oh my god i can't believe it&quot; and i was disappointed upon realizing that i didn't feel any excitement. david had said he doesn't understand it when people get overly excited when seeing someone they haven't in a long time. well i've never been one of those. while walking back i didn't know what to say to a lot of the things he was talking about, but i generally agree with a lot of things he's said too. today we also decided that graduate school is a waste of time. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>that star i was talking about yesterday? i swear it's getting brighter.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>mike severely misconstrued one of my texts today and said he's noticed that i've been &quot;yelling&quot; and &quot;tackling&quot; him as if out of &quot;anger or frustration&quot; and that it &quot;hurts&quot; him. huh? huh? huh? i don't know if he meant it physically hurt, but i have no idea what i've been doing that's coming across so negatively. i mean i punch him on the back sometimes, but that's rather obviously..good-natured. wow. what else are they averse to? he wants to talk about it now.</div>

<div>this afternoon a bunch of ACF people including diana were sitting at the student center commons. they all shouted my name..as if they were happy to see me, i thought. i didn't stop to talk to them. almost did. my default reaction has become to ignore them, rather than to stop and talk try to talk to them, even if i had nothing to say. what's happened? i had a little talk with mike before ACF today. turns out he (and possibly others, i guess) have noticed after all that i seemed withdrawn recently, not hanging out with them after ACF and sitting by myself in the back of the room. i noted that it was a behavior my brief interaction with anjaly had prompted me to try to fix. he was relieved when i told him i had no grudge of any sort against him. he kept patting me on the shoulder a lot. he also let me drive his car today. i talked to monique some, more than i think i ever have before..so that was nice too. i'm lounging around with helen, lousia, and jared right now, because i'm not interested in playing volleyball or basketball. diana had with her a &quot;sparkling juice beverage&quot; that she left in mike's car and mike keeps excessively reassuring us that it's not &quot;what [we] think it is.&quot; he doesn't even want to say the word &quot;wine&quot;? come on.</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>i took plenty of time to wither in depression this weekend. i've been listening to a lot of either angry or emotionless music, including a lot more go-to depressive songs and more rammstein than ever since i had stopped listening to them during the middle of high school. i felt like a mess last night, sitting in my room for hours upon hours, after no text came from either patrick or anjaly, and forgot what i was thinking as i was curled up in a fetal position in bed, but i was that much closer to crying than i have been in a long time. maybe i need to find some emotional release trigger, like edward norton's character in fight club. but what could it be? </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hanging out with lee was more enjoyable than i had anticipated. he said &quot;fuck it&quot; every time before we decided to hug. i walked all the way to north ave and we got free iced coffees at starbucks. he said he hated starbucks but i recommended the pumpkin spice latte to him. i thought i might try getting myself addicted to caffeine, but then decided i'd much rather be constantly tired than have trouble falling asleep. he said he would read my tumblr, and also asked for some lesser-known but good websites that i like (i named laughing squid and thought catalog). wrote them down in a little notepad. i talked to him some about my barcelona experience, the topic drifted to marijuana, and he said i don't look like the type of person who gets high easily. aw. then we just sat outside until he had to leave. he asked if i was happy with my life. that was an immediate no, but i had to tell him i'd get back to him as to why. said he thinks he could have mild depression, thinks about suicide sometimes (probably just the idea rather than imagining actually killing himself), and that he's thinking about therapy. i said everybody probably thinks they have some mild kind of depression, though if anyone i know here were to say that i would shove their faces into such bullshit and force them to eat it. then again what the fuck would i know?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>lee also told me a several of the s/e people who had been considered the smartest throughout our four years had dramatically changed, and not necessarily for the better. especially v. lee says v talks like a politician now, and that it's very hard to recognize when he's lying. i know exactly what he means..exactly what he means. lee said i haven't changed though, and the last thing he told me before we parted was to change for the better.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it was also his birthday, which he had completely forgotten until his mom called him.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i did go to mac's with patrick later that day, but i didn't see him again after that because he apparently got too drunk and never made it to the party he said he'd stop by at. so i didn't go either, and had opened my kraken bottle for nothing. neither anjaly nor i texted each other until she did at around 10 and stopped by at 3 to get the 1000 words i'd promised her.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>monique ran onto the grocery bus today when no one answered her request for a ride on facebook, so there we were, together again. i always like monique for who she is, but i've almost never gotten to talk to her this much at once before. i felt myself shrinking into my tiny little ball again as soon as she sat down next to me, and as much as i hated it, my voice immediately felt like dry sandpaper coming out of my mouth. i'm worried. i was conscious of this with lee yesterday too. i'm worried that my emotionlessness is like an anchor dragging everyone i talk to down to my level of quiet, and that consequently they're not speaking to me the way they naturally talk leaving me unable to see their true selves.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>mo was buying up ingredients for an apple cider cupcake recipe she had found because she wanted to make a ton of them and give them away to people as a simple gesture of goodwill. she suggested that we hang out while baking them, but after bringing all of our stuff back to her room i ended up leaving without asking her if she wanted to hang out or eat lunch together any time soon. i'm quite sure that she's someone around whom i can eventually haul up that anchor. for now i'm stuck handling her like glass.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>she acknowledged that my beliefs have changed, but this doubt is like quicksand. i pull myself in and out of it, afraid to stay on either side. i waver. i oscillate. i don't know where to go. i don't know what i want. i'm not sure what i believe anymore. sometimes i think i should try to go back. maybe i can try completing the path again, and this time strike gold. pascal's wager convincingly says that's the safe side, after all. maybe the ACF people are to be my crowd after all. it's only when i distance myself from them that i realize there are simply no other arms that can hold me. ~</div>

<div>the strongest attachment i've ever felt to a girl could easily be surpassed by a fifth grader. ~</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>whenever i look at the shit that's being posted in the ACF group i get pissed off, especially with david. when the fuck did he become so gay (coincidentally hannah calls him a homo sometimes too)? he keeps saying fucking retarded shit like #yolo and swag, not sincerely of course but still too excessively for my taste, and it's becoming increasingly annoying. with some people, like monique, i'm able to easily look past any such annoyances, but with others it's all i can see. ~</div>

<div>i still visit the starbucks often enough to be able to identify other people who seem to sit here regularly too. one of them is caroline. it's sad how we have nothing to say to each other even though we traveled through germany together for a week. actually i don't have anything to say to any of the people i traveled with. they disappeared alongside the summer. i did finally see sam eller for the first time since our flight back, and my hug kind of failed. i think he was one of my favorite people there. it felt strange to have a normal but short conversation with him, and he seemed to talk more quickly than i remember him talking..he was the kind of person who i had no problem being my fucked up self around, and would only laugh. a best kind of person. at least for the two months i knew him. i tried looking at his face from the point of view of someone who's never met him before.</div>

<div>anjaly's writing was confusing. she was blatantly unwilling to disclose them to me initially, and her reluctance carried all the way through to the end when i snatched her paper out of her hand (and gave her mine). she was with friends of course, one of them ethan, and wrapped up in a nice coat while i was standing outside in 40-degree weather in shorts and flip flops. she addressed me directly, indicating in her writing that she had written this specifically for me, and that was why she didn't want to share it because..i'm not really sure. i had her as an &quot;audience&quot; in mind but i didn't write my words especially for her. i've never written for anyone. she used different fonts and drifted in and out of stream-of-consciousness sounding stuff to more conversational tones. i don't understand half of what she was describing. i guess my vaguer words would introduce the same confusion to other people, even to myself once i forget what i was thinking when i wrote them. maybe this was just an initial foray for her? and that she was uncertain? she's starting to scare me. she wants to &quot;try again.&quot; meaning this writing is more like homework now. plus i can't show her this paragraph.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>words do not express thoughts very well. they always become a little different immediately after they are expressed, a little distorted, a little foolish. hermann hesse (he wrote siddhartha) said that, and wouldn't it be great to lie down on some grass or something next to someone who</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now that i'm trying to pump words out, my rivers inevitably run dry. i have no idea how i used to write 750 words a day. i don't know if i'll be able to do it for every day of november. i'm afraid i'll start manufacturing them.</div>

<div>i felt hideously distant from myself as i was working on our databases project with sally. my jeans were too tight, i had to pee, i had a math test to study for, and my computer was running low on power. i can't believe how long i've been unaware of the level i tone my voice down to. it's disgusting.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>also thinking about how a big a crush i used to have on s_ and how i had to get over it twice and how that disgusted me too and how there's nothing now and i'm annoyed that i wasted emotion on her.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I find myself living, going through the motions, executing the procedures. Just simply trying to get through the day. No inspiration. No excitement. No passion. Just going through the motions. I’m living, but I’m not alive. I find myself searching, looking. For something. Anything. Because I want to be alive, not just living. I don’t want to be close to dying and not see the difference.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i didn't write that.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
10-31; wednesday</div>

<div>&quot;she's laughing because she knows i'm drunk as shit.&quot;</div>

<div>I have such a hard time eating tomatoes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I am a victim of my own experiment.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>if even the city didn’t survive, then what hope does the pool have?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I kind of feel the same thing I had felt towards Sam.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the crying girl.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the skipping girl.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>emily j. spoke to me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I’ve fantasized about being in a relationship to the point where thinking about it makes me sick.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>talking with Asta is getting less interesting.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Never assume you will be alone.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Jessie had nice sunglasses. ray-bans.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Never assume you will be alone.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the city is flat. there are a lot of couples here. it’s cold. the streets feel like movies. I witnessed a proposal through a second floor window.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I guess Melissa thought of me today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>reminders: Joel P.: Levin, Amanda: Anna Kendrick, Patrick: Tom, Lindsay: the girl with the samsung series 9, unknown girl: the BCN Ashley</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>there was a man at the airport who could speak mandarin. it was cool, but i wanted to run away.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and I thought, would this be like the time I spent a day in St. Louis, and fell in love there?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>wish I took more pictures.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>careful monitoring.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Come on, Anjaly. You’re a smart girl. You know as well as I do that there’s no point.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Why did I turn around just as he walked by?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I didn’t get attached to anyone.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Amanda L. is Carrie.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This is just like last year.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Somewhere, Marie is laughing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Allison just sits and stares at me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
I caught a glimpse of Jessie…last Thursday.
<div><br/></div>
<div><span style="-evernote-last-insertion-point:true;"/>just today's sparks…Lisa, and Jonathan.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Enoch asked me how I am. I told him I'm better. I'm going to say that from now on.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Steph didn't want to listen to Blurred Lines.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I donated a dollar to Christina's pregnancy clinic thing…she said it means a lot to her.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I wonder if Steph's laugh has changed. How has everyone else changed?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it's been like this for a while, but whenever I'm with Tam I feel like a ghost. I get the feeling that he sees through me, because as far as he's concerned, I'm not standing by him.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Elizabeth D. held her green iPhone in her hand. She had kept her promise then.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I am no one's priority.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Who else is alone on a Saturday night?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I take the other entrance now, because it will bring me closer to her room.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Remind yourself of the reason you're going tonight.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>She experiences a fear I cannot even perceive.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Sometimes people ignore texts. This has taken an astounding amount of time to realize.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Seeing Abbi L. in her swimsuit was like seeing another universe. I see them sitting in the hot tub as I left. Whatever they were experiencing is so rare for me and it's not fair.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I hope I dream about her more. She referred to her sister as &quot;Mo.&quot;</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>There would be beer at any other party.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>With Anjaly, I always feel like it's my mission to win.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And then these two people, the just came out of nowhere and asked me if they could do a &quot;workout video&quot; in the area I was occupying. I tried to move with the flow of things, but was unable to bring myself into motion. They even introduced themselves to me. So now I'm just standing off to the side, trying to voice this out and feeling like another awkward stranger.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Recent social situations include Lisa, team buzz, David's party, and Monday's small group. Lisa was on her way to tech square, but I was happy that she decided to sit by me instead. We talked about stupid things again, like how she has &quot;crushes&quot; on her professors, her water bottle, and the bathrooms in the flag building. I wanted to stay with her too.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Team buzz was stupid. Tam continues to act as if I don't exist. I haven't spoken to Alex in so long that it was weird. I met more people I decided to dislike, although I don't hate Vince anymore, and one guy happened to be from the same area of new jersey as I am. I wasn't nearly as excited as I ought to have been. They left me behind to go get their pizza at the campanile, even after I told one of them to wait for me, and that upset me for several minutes. I knew I shouldn't have followed them around the clough building, visiting each booth, but I wasn't confident enough in myself not to.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>&quot;my mom and dad visited here, and they said that this building is ugly.&quot;</div>
<div><br/></div>

10-1 w
<div><br/></div><div>there is no longer any such thing as a month.</div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday was a horrifying gold mine. i witnessed austin roberts and brooke within minutes of each other while on my way to drop off my rent check. parked on the side of the street was a new yellow corvette, which i glimpsed her riding in on my way back to my car. who knew? she was with someone who isn't peter.</div><div><br/></div><div>kush awkwardly walking by as i stood outside papa john's.</div><div><br/></div><div>people who i forgot continued to exist independently of me, after i ceased to.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
10-2 r</div><div><br/></div><div>frustrating, that's what i have been feeling for years.  i expect  everything to be important when i don't even hold my end of the bargain. monique has shown me that i'm not worth her time. why do i still experience the urge to ask people to spend time with me, the ones who by now have clearly communicated to me that i'm not worth theirs? yet i have no interest at all in becoming friends with my coworkers, and with ACF shut down, leaves me with no outlet at all. unless you count asta, who has been increasingly unreliable. i'm losing interest and hope in everything. am more familiar with the symptons of depression than ever before. remember, there are zero people on earth who care about me. i will not let this happen to myself.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
10-5 n</div><div><br/></div><div>i woke up today feeling that wistful sadness, a peculiar longing, nostalgia, for nothing in particular. i am accompanied by nothing but lights and my little machines.</div><div><br/></div><div>i wanted to write about a stranger interaction i had today. it was at the supermarket, with the asian girl who i saw once before talking with a cashier. turns out she works there too, and i picked her register to wait in. i wonder if she remembered me. she asked me, ... i don't remember now, but it was a specific version of &quot;how are you?&quot; and i asked, &quot;how was your weekend?&quot; and instead of answering she asked me, &quot;where are you from?&quot; and i was so taken aback that i just blurted &quot;new jersey&quot; and we had a small discussion during which i must have seemed like a complete wreck. i know iwill always be looking for her every time i shop there now.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
10-9 r</div><div><br/></div><div>this &quot;falling in love with a stranger&quot; is so annoying. it happened in the parking lot today during a fire drill. she stood by herself and saw me before i walked toward and past her.</div><div><br/></div><div>merely looking at people's profile pictures is making me anxious. this is going to be harder than i thought</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>10-13 m</div><div><br/></div><div>so it's beginning to collapse. i feel the black hole in my chest. the loneliness and its associates coming to break me. blind positivity can be detrimental too. now that i am recklessly stockpiling information on what i've been missing out on, i just don't know what will happen to me when i can't take it anymore.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
10-14 t</div><div><br/></div><div>today was one of my most demoralizing days on record. the easy-to-explain part: i'm as unmotivated at work as ever, have no clue what i'm doing as i follow the Harry around, and feel completely incompetent.</div><div><br/></div><div>the difficult part, mainly because i'm having a tremendously hard time admitting my feelings to myself. asta told (revealed to) me that she's had sex with someone, and it all feels like a dream. it was more like a confirmation, because i've had the thought of her in the back of my mind a few times now. felt like, exactly like, the time way back in high school when she got her first boyfriend. a heavy reminder that she's <u>moved ahead</u>, that i'm not an essential component <u>at all</u>. that must be what i'm jealous of most, despite it being completely logical. her shift in tone is solidified now. that, is what makes me sad.</div><div><br/></div><div>meanwhile, the date for that first meetup draws near, and the delusions i can't stop myself from drawing are going to completely wreck me, i know it. i'm so agonizingly desperate for sunlight, when the only predictable thing is that it cannot possibly live up to my golden expectations. i'm begging the unseen force i'm putting all my faith in to make something work, soon.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
10-17 f</div><div><br/></div><div>there are no such things as weeks anymore. yesterday was monday for all i care.</div><div><br/></div><div>frustrations: seeing david. seeing steph. (we never greeted each other) realizing i was the fifth wheel of the group, and am not even on par with ritchie and sam. louisa instantly forgetting that i exist as soon as her boyfriend showed up. that high school aged girl in line in fron of us at moe's. that tiny cheer steph gave me when she finally bothered to ask me what i've been doing. (it made me feel less integrated with the group, and not supportive at all) that each of them were with someone who meant the world to them, while simultaneously with me, who means nothing to them. that my best companions right now are rodney and zora. david making sarcastic quips to me during the movie. that i didn't care anywhere close to crying during it. that the young actress looked extremely similar to debby ryan and was unbelievably pretty. that everyone, including me this time, immediately shattered mood that the movie left us/me in. even one as sappy as this. that i am desperate to find someone who understands me.</div><div><br/></div><div>rodney told me his real name.</div><div><br/></div><div>maybe the reason i'm still hopeful for my future is that i am at such a starved, emotional low that i can't even conceive of any other way to go.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
the following monday</div><div><br/></div><div>i forgot to mention last weekend, the girl to my left watching the romantic dram by herself.</div><div><br/></div><div>went to the second meetup today, organized by a guy who looks li ke bruce willis. a chubby indian girl, a skinny guy who was kind of awkward but not awkwardly awkward, and a heavily bearded guy and a country-looking girl. the haunted house was okay. i just wanted to involuntarily scream.</div><div><br/></div><div>i was silent most of the time and was looking forward to driving home at the end. there were a lot of high school age kids. i'll keep surrounding myself with strangers, but i'm having a hard time seeing myself make any new friends from this.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
the next day</div><div><br/></div><div>it's happened just as i predicted. that strange, ethereal &quot;happiness&quot; has been nearly entirely replaced with sad, persistent frustration. the ehavy, cloudy frustration barring my attempts to &quot;smile.&quot; that makes me always want to cry but blocks all of my tears at the same time. i can feel actual pressure in my chest. it's from my heart, i know it.</div><div><br/></div><div>how extraordinarily ironic and zora and rodney are my only outlets now.</div><div><br/></div><div>this afternoon i was behind a man in the stairwell. we emerged into the stairwell and he met up with a girl. a cute girl. thie mere sight of the two of them, and listening to them ask each other how they've been, while exchanging a kis... was like a machine gun being emptied into me.</div><div><br/></div><div>will i ever be able to laugh one day when i'm looking back at what i'm feeling now?</div><div><br/></div><div>i feel impossibly, irreparably inadequate. i can't even carry out the most BASIC functions of a Standard Normal Human Being. how will i ever be able to perform something as complex as winning a girl's heart?</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
10-24 f</div><div><br/></div><div>i'm going to take yesterday as a good sign, proof that something interesting <u>can</u> happen outside. at the side door, i met theRadBrad, and it was quite surreal as i consider it now and wonder what i came across as. did i behave too weirdly? he said he would send me a message but hasn't. i'm treating that promise the same i would with anyone else.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
10- 26 n</div><div><br/></div><div>fourth experiment so far. they aren't yielding any results. not that i was expecting any....so soon. but is time even a factor here?</div><div><br/></div><div>i'm trying to determine if there was anything significantly different about this group of people. i felt a lot of disdain. except for the people... who talked.</div><div><br/></div><div>the lady who cut my hair today was super nice.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
halloween</div><div><br/></div><div>i've had it. i've had it with. this has got to stop, do you understand? you <u>will</u> <u>not</u> <u>survive</u> if you keep going like this. everybody else has moved long ago. the <u>only</u> reason you had a shitty halloween, a shitty birthday, shitty weekends... is because you choose to. <u>you</u> choose to. say you go on facebook to remind yourself... it is not everybody else you hate, but your own damn, sorry self. get the fuck off your ass and <u>fix it</u> while you still have the goddamn time. i have nothing else to say to you.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div><b>10-1 r</b></div><div><br/></div><div>the christian from work has a girlfriend, or at least i&apos;m pretty sure he does. somehow. i have to infer from his and mark&apos;s conversation. unlike amber and mark, who are much more open about their personal lives. chris almost never self-discloses. i have never heard him mention her before, ever. so it was the big news of the day, and it&apos;s so sad. the only positive spin i can put on it is that if he can find someone, then i can too, though i&apos;m sure it&apos;ll work like that. i realized i&apos;ve become too attached to my version of himself in my head, similar to what i had in mind with amber. although i&apos;m sure part of me knew to expect the unexpected too. which was exactly this. when mark asked me if i have a lady in my life, i simply said no.</div><div><br/></div><div>i&apos;m not sure i have ever found people around whom i have a harder time being myself than chris and mark (and amber too). i don&apos;t feel incompetent, but i always feel like there&apos;s a solid wall between us when we&apos;re talking. chris himself is quiet and i can barely hear the things he says. today at the gym i simply said &quot;i can&apos;t hear anything.&quot; they asked me if i had a problem with my ears and i didn&apos;t explain what i meant, just shook my head. i feel excluded from the conversation all the time but that&apos;s just because i almost never offer my own input. it feels pointless, like wasted energy. but i feel sick when i&apos;m unable to talk to people now too.</div><div><br/></div><div>the two of them are both adults older than me but also kind of meek and it makes me want to remain able to convince myself that i can be on top of them. but because i don&apos;t even see a sliver of their lives, whatever i&apos;m looking at is a fallacy. that&apos;s why i&apos;m prone to these attitude swings towards them, why i go from liking to disliking them so frequently. i wish it were easy to do away with these barriers.</div><div><br/></div><div>i think i&apos;ve become an extrovert with social anxiety.</div><div><br/></div><div>--</div><div><br/></div><div>i don&apos;t think i&apos;ve really been asking myself if it means anything to not be invited to a wedding, but those are the words that keep bouncing inside my head. it means something simple, actually: that i don&apos;t matter anymore. and i know i haven&apos;t mattered for a long time. maybe i never mattered at all. everyone else still seems to. i see it on facebook. funny that i retold a joke about marriage that i heard (i think it was) louis c.k. tell, shortly after i ran into david at the gym. for the first time, it was kind of awkward seeing him. i had imagined him entirely separate by now, and it was weird seeing him at the CRC, on campus. i thought about all the times that i asked him to come hang out at my apartment, the promises that weren&apos;t even promises, that weren&apos;t kept. and i didn&apos;t really want to see him again. i said a dry &quot;congrats&quot; on getting married to steph. i think we use to hug but we just shook hands. we must half talked for only thirty seconds, and it was about which muscles we were working out today. it was the stupidest conversation i&apos;ve ever had with him. i wonder if it&apos;ll be the last. i understood something as i looked at him. that we aren&apos;t friends anymore. like dan brady, he didn&apos;t say bye whenever he left (i&apos;m assuming he left because i couldn&apos;t see him anywhere shortly after).</div><div><br/></div><div>it must have been a couple months ago that krish told me to buy that groupon to some show with aziz ansari. that&apos;s happening this weekend, the show i mean. i went to the site wanting to cancel it but it was too late and i&apos;m not getting the $25 back. i don&apos;t want to go. if he doesn&apos;t contact me i&apos;m not going. he probably doesn&apos;t even remember telling me to buy it. i&apos;m not falling for the Sunk Cost Fallacy this time.</div><div><br/></div><div>i realized that that night at the joystick he made me feel similarly to how the JB had made me feel. about myself. i don&apos;t need somebody like that right now. wasn&apos;t i always uneasy around him? there go the good memories. i remember thinking way back in JANUARY that a year is a lot of time for things to happen. it&apos;s 75% of the way through, and i&apos;ve made absolutely nothing happen. i can&apos;t trust myself anymore.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>10-11 n</b></div><div><br/></div><div>i received messages from both zora and kat yesterday and they both kind of led to nothing. is it because of me? i don&apos;t know what to think anymore. should i tell krish that kat texted me? i want to see if he has anything to say about it.</div><div><br/></div><div>i&apos;m sure my relationship with alice is pretty normal. i think about it so much and she probably doesn&apos;t. i communicate with her more than i do with my brother. we&apos;ve hung out only twice and i think i&apos;ve seen her only three times. and each time it felt so surreal. i can render her face in my mind but i&apos;m not sure i can even actually recall it yet.</div><div><br/></div><div>it may have been a childish move, but i didn&apos;t go to the comedy thing last weekend with krish. and i know he doesn&apos;t care, there&apos;s no way he wasn&apos;t going with several other friends anyway. even if he weren&apos;t he still wouldn&apos;t care. i never liked being around him anyway. he always stressed me out. even when he was apparently trying to help me. he&apos;s still the only new &quot;friend&quot; i&apos;ve made since last year and i need to not need him. not like i have a choice.</div><div><br/></div><div>the biggest joke of all was that i ditched him in favor of alice. but she never contacted me that weekend. i heard from her a few days later, earlier this week, saying that she had dropped her phone in the toilet.</div><div><br/></div><div>harry (from work) bought the iphone 6s for me, saving me the sales tax, so he could get the cashback points, not out of any niceness for me particularly. he demanded that i pay him back the same day, and i relented. it&apos;s part of the reason i ended up keeping the new phone. i felt quite uncomfortable with it initially. it felt extremely strange driving him to the mall. going to the apple store. pretending i didn&apos;t already know exactly where it was from where i parked. failing at talking to the apple employee who tried to force small talk with me. i actually handed the conversation off to harry. i know i don&apos;t deserve everyone&apos;s attention, but i thought he looked like the kind of person who wouldn&apos;t care to keep the conversation going. always looking down at his phone! chris and mark from work rarely do that and i may have become accustomed to it?</div><div><br/></div><div>speaking of chris and mark, the pair frustrate me so much when i&apos;m around them and i still have a hard time putting into words why. i keep trying to think of how i&apos;d say to someone with whom i&apos;m talking about them. it&apos;s like talking to a brick wall? to someone who&apos;s not really there. neither of them never make eye contact, but it still feels unnatural when we&apos;re looking at each other. i want to be better than them, i want to be more comfortable with myself than they are with themselves. this straining is what&apos;s causing me the stress. i just can&apos;t let go of it, but i&apos;m trying to. i have to make a conscious effort to not force myself to say anything i don&apos;t actually want to say.</div><div><br/></div><div>i&apos;m sure they feel the same way around me. i mean they can&apos;t be so closed off around everybody. we&apos;re all the same, us three, as far as i&apos;m concerned.</div><div><br/></div><div>somehow my life is starting to seem even more pathetic than it was in my third year. and i&apos;m becoming anxious and depressed again, too fixed to do anything about it. maybe it is seasonal, after all. late spring and early summer made me feel like i actually had a chance. this fall and winter is looking to be a regression again. it&apos;s not that these emotions are the strongest, they&apos;re all i ever feel. that&apos;s why the music for them feels so strong.</div><div><br/></div><div>i&apos;ve been thinking a lot about where i was emotionally one year ago and it&apos;s because i want to be able to compare my past and present selves and easily see how much better i am now. i can feel myself sinking dangerously into the comfort though. so much time passes and it&apos;s unbelievable how little i&apos;m able to remember. that means that nothing has been happening that whole time! nothing to log, nothing to look back to. i want to experience so many things but i don&apos;t know how. i think i need some sort of key, and i know i don&apos;t, everybody will say i don&apos;t. i&apos;m slowly starting to realize that i&apos;m not normal. in a dangerous way. this isn&apos;t how a 23-year-old should be living his life. i&apos;m wasting a horrid amount of time. my future self is extremely disappointed in me right now. how much longer will i choose to not be happier than i am right now? to not make myself happier... i only think i&apos;m okay because i&apos;ve closed every curtain and cut everybody off. killed all the bridges. no more standards. that&apos;s the only way to make everything seem okay. to block out my descent. currently giving the abstinence another go. maybe it will lead me somewhere again, i&apos;m walking on thin ice this time though. i need to be careful or i&apos;ll relapse again.</div><div><br/></div><div>i&apos;m looking forward to my next scheduled drive home just for the journey. it&apos;ll be me and hours and hours of specific music that&apos;s become re-associated with it.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>10-19 m</b></div><div><br/></div><div>i&apos;m starting to think this depression IS somewhat seasonal. why is it only the cold weather that is attached to everything? last year, tech, even high school, if i want to think about it i can. it&apos;s been just over a year since i found meetup.com and i kind of want to go some of those stupid trivia nights with the Angie just to relive past times. i actively dwell in it now. i found and redownloaded a lot of the tumblr videos i used to watch last year. primarily to remind me of how i felt back then. i&apos;m already planning future memories at home. how i want it to be remembered in the further future.</div><div><br/></div><div>alice and zora don&apos;t care.</div><div><br/></div><div>i felt better around mark and chris today than i did a week ago. mark mentioned building a computer for his wife and that kickstarted a discussion about that. i still bite my tongue too much though.</div><div><br/></div><div>among other realizations. i recognize what i&apos;m choosing to bond with now and i&apos;m not doing anything to stop it. just ready to fully withdraw, again, indefinitely. just going back to waiting, and waiting.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>10-25 n</b></div><div><br/></div><div>by this time last year i was fully immersed in all the things that i keep thinking back to. as terrible as i always describe it, i&apos;m thinking an awful lot about recreating its emotional signature. the music i listened to, the games i played, the layout of my room, the places i went, the things i tried. i&apos;m constantly recalling them all. and i&apos;m trying to be aware of how i&apos;m going to remember the present in the future. going so far as to plan what i&apos;m going to do at home. during the winter.</div><div><br/></div><div>the latest depressive phase has set in and i&apos;m starting to think that i&apos;m choosing it this time around. choosing to give up on abstention, choosing to continue wasting my time on L4D2, choosing to sink away yet again from the rest of humanity. what happened to my mindset during the summer, when i thought i might actually be capable of turning things around?</div><div><br/></div><div>ROdNEY and Zora continue to surprise me occasionally. ROdNEY with the things he opens up to me about, Zora just by dropping in. she&apos;s dropped out of beauty school. i wonder if ROdNEY even considers it opening up.</div><div><br/></div><div>last thursday i IM&apos;d the Chris at work and told him i&apos;d rather go to eats than work arms at the gym. he didn&apos;t answer the message and when he walked past me in the lobby to go to the CRC alone he didn&apos;t even look at me, just let out a stupid giggle of some kind. fuck that.</div><div><br/></div><div>i feel bad for my parents for the way i treat them. i invariably become annoyed whenever i skype with them. i&apos;m not even sure why. i never tell my mother how i really feel. she would just feel bad and sad for me and i don&apos;t need to do that to her. i can ignore my problems on my own.</div><div><br/></div><div>today i actually tried texting the Kat.</div><div><br/></div><div>what do david and all the others think about people like me? they would look at me and think, what a poor, poor soul.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div><b>10-3 m</b></div><div><br/></div><div>so the wedding was this weekend, and I don&apos;t really have anything to say about it. other than feeling uncomfortable in my semi-formal attire (still), immediately being overcome with anxiety when I saw how many people were there, insecure about my depressed mood and messed up hair, and inability to comprehend how it could be the happiest day of several people&apos;s lives while I felt absolutely nothing. we&apos;d arrived late and missed the vows. the parents kept saying that it&apos;ll be my turn next. for the first time, I felt afraid that I&apos;ll disappoint them.</div><div><br/></div><div>I did play L4D2 with the crew a few times while my parents were over, and I kept forgetting that there was anyone else in the room with me.</div><div><br/></div><div>on the evening of the wedding we went to a chinese restaurant for dinner, and to get there we passed the area on roswell rd (?) where I went to my first meetup almost two years ago. the parking lot I parked in before going to the deer bar, the small plaza with the road runner shop, the bar where we met up for that one before running. the diner where I ran into theRadBrad. I hadn&apos;t been in that area since.</div><div><br/></div><div>my parents have only been here for three full days. this weekend felt significantly longer than usual. because I was out doing different things, for once.</div><div><br/></div><div>I miss the new-ness of the once-new times. the &quot;novelty.&quot; that&apos;s why the second half of 2014 still rings so golden. the other times, such as late 2010 and 2012, are too faded now.</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>10-4 t</b></div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m pretty sure it&apos;s jessie&apos;s birthday today. it&apos;s no longer visible on her facebook profile to me, so I can&apos;t check to be sure.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>10-6 r</b></div><div><br/></div><div>parents left on monday. after stressing out way too much on how untidy the place becomes when company is over, it was a little nice to return to an empty place. while they were here, it felt like they had always been here. when they left, it was like they were never here. the &quot;afterglow&quot; this time was extremely short.</div><div><br/></div><div>christian can be beyond retarded sometimes. we automatically head to his car to drive to the CRC now. on monday the parking lot was full, and that&apos;s still all it takes for him to give up instantly. I wonder if it&apos;s because he&apos;s older, a set-in-his-ways type thing. he&apos;s willing to pay $3 every day...when we got back he once again began complaining about there being no parking for employees. he keeps saying the same things over and over.</div><div><br/></div><div>I still remember that night that melissa and I walked from clough to her car parked in the small plaza where lucky buddha is. it must have been that day I at with her at the east side of the third floor of the building and watched her draw on her tablet. as we walked she had put her arm around either my waist or my shoulder, I can&apos;t remember which, and mentioned a term from the dictionary of obscure sorrows, which I think I introduced her to. at the time it freaked me out a little bit. I wish I could remember why I felt so. I&apos;d give so much to be back in those times that are rapidly receding. if I were there now, I&apos;d so put my arm back around her.</div><div><br/></div><div>discovered r/exchristian a short while ago.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>10-12 w</b></div><div><br/></div><div>christian and I could and probably should be better friends. my intuition isn&apos;t always right with him, but overall I&apos;d say he&apos;s taken to my company a little bit better. we&apos;ll just always be what we are around each other. last friday I wanted to get a quick workout in without him but he suggested rocky mountain pizza for lunch so I said okay. it was the place where I first met Abbey last year. I was wearing the white reigning champ hoodie I&apos;d just gotten. our waitress was unbelievably cute and I think it woke up some small thing within me...some kind of butterfly. she seemed kind of shy. I kept telling myself that if christian weren&apos;t there with me then I would have asked her out. always some excuse. he asked her a question for me, how big the pizza slices were. every time someone came by and asked how we were doing, he was the one who answered. we left without me asking her anything and I&apos;ll never see her again. I don&apos;t remember her name.</div><div><br/></div><div>that weekend I was a little less than content with being alone. the entirety of my compromised, hedonistic phase was spent alone; what other way could there have been? and that fantasy isn&apos;t sustainable anymore. everything acquired during its stay has become worthless or was never worth anything. the accumulation is ridiculous.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m sure my life didn&apos;t really begin until 2010. all of memories of 2014 and earlier feel so incredibly distant, I still can&apos;t grasp at it. similar to how far away a dream feels after I&apos;ve woken up. I&apos;m becoming unsure if any of the parts I&apos;m desperately trying to hold on to ever even happened. 2016 is the seventh year starting from 2010. I can still count the times. when will I no longer be able to keep track of that. what will the memories look like then? I&apos;m a little scared. time passes too quickly now. not just the days, but the hours too.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>10-18 t</b></div><div><br/></div><div>losing count</div><div><br/></div><div>the days can&apos;t keep up, so initially I count the weeks; the weeks since moving in, since coming back after returning home, since my parents left after their visit. soon they become too blurry, just a blotch on the calendar. it becomes months ago, then years ago on my grand timescale. so far it&apos;s the sixth year since things begun. I can only wonder, right now, what it&apos;ll be like when the years blur too.</div><div><br/></div><div>saturday, the 15th</div><div><br/></div><div>I drove to auto spa bistro, as I&apos;d promised myself I would do. all the other cars there were higher-end. maybe they paid more attention to those. every single person there was black. there was some event going on around the city, I think it was a marathon. lots of pink. I went across the street to eat at moe&apos;s by myself while waiting. I couldn&apos;t believe how far off my delusions of a clean car (of all things) were.</div><div><br/></div><div>afterwards I stopped at target and ran into the Anna and Julie. from the Angie&apos;s meetup group. last year and earlier. I recognized Julie&apos;s voice first. Anna and I looked at each other for a second. I have no way of knowing if she recognized me. maybe if I still had last year&apos;s mindset, I would have tried to circle around and speak to them. what a missed opportunity.</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s no use</div><div><br/></div><div>there&apos;s little point in talking to v now.</div><div><br/></div><div>ROdNEY has disappeared. I don&apos;t see him online, but his steam account will say he was last online at a recent time, less than one day ago. I don&apos;t know why he won&apos;t talk to me. it sucks.</div><div><br/></div><div>last week I realized that &apos;far&apos; doesn&apos;t make me think of barcelona anymore. I should be panicking more than this. I guess my mind has become too hazy over the past year and my memories are fading rapidly. trying desperately to hold on to multiple sections per year. too many hours of music. soon they will meld and dissolve naturally and there&apos;s nothing I can do about that. it honestly scares me.</div><div><br/></div><div>2 pm</div><div><br/></div><div>christian has been absent for a few days and honestly I like it a little better this way.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>10-29 s</b></div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m still a little bit drunk right now but I just got back from the halloween party that bina invited me to. it turned out to be at the Tiffany&apos;s house, one of the girls I&apos;d met a few months ago when I went to see the last star trek movie with bina. things went about as I had expected. I was one of the first few people there and when I got there a &quot;Megan&quot; was there already. I didn&apos;t think much of her at first but she somehow seemed to become increasingly familiar the more I thought about it, although I just don&apos;t really think I had met her anywhere before.</div><div><br/></div><div>people soon began filing in. I felt as awkward as usual. I got to work drinking a bourbon mixed some syrup that was way too sweet. ate some mini chicken pot pies. the Tiffany had prepared quite a lot of food. I talked a little with an indian guy who turned out to be married to a girl I had initially mistaken for bina&apos;s friend the &quot;Lila.&quot; he had just moved from boston and we talked a little bit about meetups and video games. I realized he reminded me of the Rob from Angie&apos;s group. he later left without us saying good-bye. he must have been somewhat drunk. I&apos;ll probably never see him again.</div><div><br/></div><div>Tiffany has an unbelievably cute dog named Lily who got a lot of attention from everybody. I asked her a little bit about her and I&apos;ve already forgotten where she said she adopted her from.</div><div><br/></div><div>the total people I can recall were: Tiffany, bina, Megan, the black girl married to the awkward white guy, the boston couple, the three gay guys, the indian girl dressed as rey, bina&apos;s friend Lila and the guy Mark she came with, the girl dressed as storm, the girl in the red dress who kind of reminded me of olive oyl, the tall indian guy, the obnoxious indian guy dressed as a pharoh and the girl he came with who looked like an indian version of lisa, pamela, the extra girl. pamela and I talked for a little bit before we got distracted and never picked up the conversation again. I saw her playing solitaire or something on her phone. she didn&apos;t talk to many people. I wanted to say something to her but never did.</div><div><br/></div><div>just before I left, while waiting for my uber, I was happy to be able to talk to the Lila a little bit. we also discussed video games but she wasn&apos;t much interested in the games I play and vice versa. I asked bina one more time about doctor strange but I guess we aren&apos;t seeing it next week because Lila will be in london. I didn&apos;t mention that I&apos;d spent a week there too. I&apos;m hoping we can talk about that if I ever see her again.</div><div><br/></div><div>I had left my wine out for too long and it already tasted horrible. I pocketed the rubber stopper and just left the nearly full bottle sitting there on the table.</div><div><br/></div><div>my costume was a nametag reading &quot;Brad.&quot; the idea came from the office. I was going to copy it directly and use &quot;Dave&quot; but I thought that if Bina saw it it&apos;d make her think of our Dave from the real office, so I used brad instead because it sounded mildly derpy and was a nod to theRadBrad. the idea confused most people there, although some people picked up the reference. I had the most issues with the obnoxious pharoh-dressed kid who always spoke with a fake accent, although he dropped it several times, especially towards the end of the night. I took my costume and stuck it on to him, and he later tore it up and tossed it into the garbage. although I mostly didn&apos;t care, I still didn&apos;t like the disrespect. people never forget how you make them feel. he made me think of the JB. even bina and some of the others seemed surprised at how far he went. I wondered if they actually found it amusing.</div><div><br/></div><div>I noticed and took too much solace in the fact that I wasn&apos;t the only one there who was aloof and quiet for much of the party. we never played any games or anything. I made to take at least one picture. most of the people there knew bina; I kept saying that she was the one person linking us all together. the girls were really loud and I expect the neighboring people to have been able to hear us. I thought about how lame I&apos;d feel if I had stayed at home and heard nearby parties happening by me. bina&apos;s &quot;costume&quot; (a gumball machine) made no sense to me.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div>10-1 n</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">so last week:</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">on tuesday I drove christian to jalisco upon my suggestion. after eating, as we were getting back into my car, I think he dropped a jolly rancher wrapper onto the parking lot and joking commented that I littered. I didn&apos;t say anything. that changed my opinion of him though.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">on wednesday the power went out again after having gone out twice last weekend. I heard some voices in the hallway outside and decided to go throw out some trash, and ended up walking towards three people around my age gathered outside their doors talking. they introduced themselves to me and I ended up hanging out with them for a few minutes. it was so significant for me and I had to use a lot of processing power. one of them mentioned a facebook group for residents of the building and said he&apos;d invite me to it, but after we dispersed I realized that there was no way he&apos;d be able to find me. actually I recognized it while we were still talking, but didn&apos;t specify what my facebook profile name and picture were for some reason. I had only run into one of the three, twice, very briefly, in nearly a year and half of living here, and thought maybe I&apos;d just never see them again and never end up becoming friends with any of them.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">but then the next day I saw one of them again standing outside, when I chose to take the stairs over the elevator after checking my mailbox (where the old man with the dog said hi to me yet again). so I was able to look myself up on facebook with his phone. he mentioned he was single and he also knows urvashi. I mentioned I was single too, and also used my old &quot;there&apos;s nothing I&apos;m less interested in than sports&quot; line, which I think was too negative of a thing to say. he said he&apos;d invite me to the facebook group, but so far there&apos;s nothing. so either I initiate something, or nothing happens.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I&apos;d asked mike if he wanted to get lunch again, but I&apos;m pretty sure he doesn&apos;t want to.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I keep bombarding sam with random texts.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>10-3 t</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I guess it&apos;s better to keep yourself distracted with things to do than things to buy.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>10-9 m</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">some time during the last couple weeks, a thing turned around and I got an offer from the company called touchpeak. and just like that, a 3+ year long phase ends. I don&apos;t feel entirely ready to leave tech. I want to keep walking down the hallways and sitting at my computer for hours mindlessly scrolling through shit. a few more times, with attention. the disruption I&apos;m most worried about is the CRC and whether I&apos;ll be able to continue consistently going. either way, I&apos;m sure the era with christian is coming to a close.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">my opinion of</span><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">DOOGIE turned around when he called me on friday and gave me some advice on how to handle job offers. I was not expecting that sincerity. and now I&apos;m a little more willing to meet up with him again the next time I&apos;m in or near the city.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">on saturday I went to another classic trivia meetup event with the Angie&apos;s group, which I initially joined three years ago now, and again got nothing out of it. I knew she&apos;d recognize me but that was it. the same sorts of people, none of them for me. I felt uncomfortable talking to her with them watching me. I knew it was visible.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>10-12 r</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I&apos;ve been holding these in my head for weeks now.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I no longer think about the time the way I did 1-2 years ago. when it always &apos;it&apos;s been a year, two years, three years since this&apos;. may</span><span style="line-height: 1.45;">be that&apos;s because too much of it has passed? too many individual events to keep track of now. too many soundtracks. I can only remember so many different colors. it&apos;s been two years since fall of 2015. only two years? two whole years?</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">now, everything just feels the same. we&apos;re in the middle of october, but it still feels like summer. I don&apos;t mean the weather. not the weather outside, anyway, but the weather in my head. I&apos;m certain that at this time last year, it was evening, the sky had darkened outside, the lights were on inside. this time, the sun hasn&apos;t even gone down yet.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I know, it always feels the same because of the grind, and any transitions that occur are too slow to observe in real time. but these differences between my unique memories seem to me to be shrinking. anyway, the ever expanding vastness is inevitably going to reduce entire spectra to pixels. it&apos;s the one true unstoppable force, and it&apos;s so terrifying. the water keeps getting colder.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">they were all only ever important to me anyway.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I am about to experience a big disruption and I don&apos;t feel prepared. it&apos;s coming in only a week. when I think about for a minute, I start fearing the shift. something unpredictable again.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">lights and courtney barnett will be my familiar voices for this end of year.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div>10-13 f</div></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">the woman who works at the ups store on 10th remembered me when I went in there yesterday afternoon.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">I waited until wednesday to tell the marty and bina that I&apos;d be leaving next week. the next day bina asked me why I hadn&apos;t told her earlier. which wasn&apos;t unexpected, actually. part of me wants to have told her earlier. but what difference would that have made?</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: &apos;Segoe UI&apos;;">also on wednesday I had lunch at la fonda with one Joe Broccoli, a young sharp-looking man with glasses, plenty of product in his hair, wearing a polo. he was only a couple years older than me and spoke confidently. I felt slightly nervous initially because social interaction, but I was able to keep up without any real trouble other than conscious eye contact and hand/arm positions. I was probably a little stiff.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div>10-16 m</div></div><div><br/></div><div style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">today definitely felt like the first day of fall.</span></div><div style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">there are only two days left until I leave GTRI for good. christian injured his shoulder last week, so I won&apos;t be spending my last days working out with him. I think there&apos;s a good chance I&apos;ll never see him again. I&apos;ve been going to the crc on my own in the afternoons/evenings, when a lot more students are in there with me.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">&nbsp;</span></div><div><hr/>
10-17 t</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">today I went to the CRC for probably the last time. I had considered jalisco with the group one last time, but decided that the CRC meant more to me. I went there a second time in the afternoon, and ran around the roe stamps field one more time too.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">Susan was kind enough to invite everyone out to lunch tomorrow on my last day. Ben expressed his surprise. I hadn&apos;t told him, or most other people that I&apos;d be gone. he told me that I&apos;ve made him laugh more than most of the other people there. I began considering that I may be a funny person.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">I&apos;m not ready for it all to end, but it will simply go right ahead and end.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
10-18 w</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">it all just ends unceremoniously. I&apos;m hardly the first to leave anyway. there will always be a part of me wishing for some fanfare. but who am I to be so special.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">I didn&apos;t see christian at all this week. had lunch with a group: Susan, Eddie, Greg, Patrick, Arnond, Anne (who bought me lunch!), Doug. I do recall going away lunches for the other employees who left before me, and I never gave them very much thought. so it was dumb for me to think that everyone gathered for lunch today for me, but I did think that for a bit. I learned that Arnond lived in the caldwell dorm in 2000 or 2001. they all asked me where I was going and wished me luck. I didn&apos;t get a chance to say a proper good-bye to Marty. I think he wanted to, but was a little hesitant to say more. Arnond and I also exchanged a few words, together with bina too. when the time came for me to pack up and go, she shook my hand in a playfully rough way. I want to think that she wanted to give me a hug, but shied away from doing so. Arnond shook my hand too. never said anything to Kyle.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">I wish I felt more, but I can only repeat so many times how blase everything seems despite this being...what should be...a big moment in my life. my first Professional job switch. one of the last remaining new things I can experience, maybe.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><hr/>
10-19 r</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">it certainly doesn&apos;t Feel like the beginning of anything new.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">I went to the touchpeak office for the second time today (and I&apos;ll just lose count from here) and met the people again. the founder, a Michael Balzer, was there today, and he was a smaller person than I expected. he dressed casually. I spent most of the morning trying to remember everyone&apos;s names and getting my computer set up. I kept thinking about all the ways that this &quot;change&quot; is affecting me. I felt like I had nothing. the room is different. the keyboard and mouse are different. the people are different. the parking is different. part of me was screaming to go back to the way things were. and that higher order has to come in and remind me, every time, that I need this to happen if I want to move anywhere.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">one of them reminded me of Patrick from gtri, but taller and lankier. one had a raspy sort of voice and smokes. one had a slight african-sounding accent. one was overweight and had a slow, lopsided gait. they were all much closer to my age than I&apos;ve been used to, and the youth is reflected in the things they talked about during lunch when I went with them. maybe I would have felt better if I weren&apos;t so anxious from the newness of everything, but probably not much better. they were all clearly more comfortable talking to each other than they were talking to me. then again I wasn&apos;t entirely comfortable talking to all of them. if there&apos;s to be a plot twist to come out of this, I&apos;ll have to forge it.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">I think the one with the dodge charger seemed a little insecure, but I can never tell anymore if my assessment is anywhere near accurate, or if it&apos;s just a reflection.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">there&apos;s no more walking into a dim, carpeted, cozy, quiet room, sitting down at my desk alone, and browsing reddit while eating a fast food breakfast. the new place is wide open and makes me feel vulnerable. the anxiety is making me a unhappy and negative with everything. I hope it will be over soon. I can&apos;t remember what it was like three years ago in 2014.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">DOOGIE texted me this morning wishing me a great first day at my new job.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">everything just feels unnatural and disgusting when it changes, and it&apos;s all stemming from the resistance.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">my buzz card currently still allows me into the crc, I&apos;m guessing until the end of the month. if alumni are allowed memberships there, I may not have to find a new gym.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
10-20 f</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">last night I decided to sit in and eat at the pho king across the street, when a girl walked in a buzzcut head and worn boots. I think she was there to pick up an order to deliver to someone. she sounded familiar, but I didn&apos;t recognize her until she walked past me again on her way out. I realized (I&apos;m pretty sure) it was the Alexis from eats. she said a brief hello as she strode by and was gone before I could possibly hope to say anything. I wonder if she was embarrassed by any chance.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><hr/>
10-21 s</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">I was half hoping I would just end up waking up past 8 this morning so I&apos;d have an excuse to not go to the running meetup, but in fact I woke up in time actually didn&apos;t even feel very groggy. pushed the remaining excuses out of my brain. decided to drive myself there even though I wasn&apos;t certain I&apos;d be able to find a spot to park in, but I guess I got lucky on a chilly saturday morning. I felt mostly fine walking in to meet a group of unfamiliar people, because at least I&apos;d get a run out of it.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">some older people were sitting at a table and small groups who already knew each other were talking while I stood by two other people who seemed to be around my age. one of them (he told me his name was Jake) turned to me with no introduction and simply asked me where I worked. I was a little taken aback and didn&apos;t address his question immediately. his voice was low and hard to hear, just like mine, and he didn&apos;t smile a lot. I figured he was just trying, so I tried to smile myself and seem open and friendly.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">I was one of two or three new members of the group, and when everyone gathered together by the trail and the newbies were asked to identify themselves, I raised my hand. the organizer said to tell everyone something interesting about myself, but I just said my name and nothing else. someone asked where I&apos;m from so I said that. I don&apos;t think I gave off a very positive vibe.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">that Jake ran off in front, and I was faster than most of the others, so I quickly found myself alone and got lost a couple times before finding a group and tailing them. then they dropped behind to walk so it was just me with two girls who didn&apos;t pay any attention to me. by the end of the trail, a guy named Cody somehow merged with us, and we walked a lap around a soccer field, the two girls in front talking, and me with Cody talking to each other. we talked some about our previous experiences with meetup groups, how much running we do, and our jobs. and it felt easy. I was surprised at how much he kept the conversation going by continuing to talk when I took too long to respond. he was 32 and reminded me of david a little bit.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">we talked a little bit more at jason&apos;s deli, where we all ate afterwards and where I haven&apos;t been since some time with ACF. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ll ever see the people that I talked to ever again.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>10-24 t</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">I&apos;ve yet to do any real work at this new job so far. I&apos;m feeling the anxiety-induced emptiness, the loneliness that comes with this type of change. even though, other than the new job location, nothing else is different. it&apos;s not like I had people to turn to while I was working at tech.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">saturday night was slightly funny. I was going to keep myself &quot;socializing&quot; after the morning by going to one of the Angie&apos;s groups again, at a three dollar cafe. except I didn&apos;t even think to check the location, and ended up going to the wrong one. I had a feeling that that would happen, and somehow didn&apos;t notice that the event they were planning to go to after the dinner couldn&apos;t possibly be anywhere near the three dollar cafe that I went to. the person inside didn&apos;t recognize the group name I gave him, and I decided to just sit and eat by myself, trying to ignore the fact that I was the only person I could see who was there by himself. the waitress was, it seemed to me, somewhat overly friendly and kept touching my arm/shoulder.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">as I was getting ready to leave I saw a really young attractive girl sit down with a group of other people, and I thought about her for a minute.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">outside, there was another young girl (who I also noticed on my way inside) who I&apos;d guess was newly homeless. she asked me for something as I walked past her, I wasn&apos;t sure if she said &quot;a dollar&quot; or &quot;a cup of water&quot; to help her out with. I didn&apos;t stop walking as I told her I don&apos;t have anything, and she immediately said &quot;okay,&quot; looking back down, almost seeming apologetic for having bothered me. it was very different from the way the occasional guy outside eats pesters me for something.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><hr/>
10-26 r</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">a couple days ago I worked in with someone on one of the benches at the crc. he was a little timid and thought I was a student. he might even have been a freshman, based on him asking me small questions like what year I was. neither of us said much to each other while lifting, unlike the other guy I worked with last week who kept giving the encouraging &quot;nice&quot; and &quot;you got this.&quot; so I tried saying some of that myself and saw him smiling, probably in the same way I do when I hear that said to me.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><hr/>
10-30 m</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">maybe it&apos;s just because I&apos;ve been going to the crc on my own, but I feel like many people have approached me there asking to work in and talking a little bit. last week there was a guy whose deadlift barbell I started using. I think he said something about being rude? and was talking to someone about it, and that he&apos;d had a rough week. he talked to me about using a weight lifting belt. I also saw Tye and the girl who calls herself Nic, and I made eye contact with them both but they looked away and pretended not to notice me. today, however, I saw Tye again, this time with Marty, and we ended up doing a few exercises together. my bench press is stronger than either of theirs. Marty asked me a little about my new job, and I realized I&apos;d completely neglected to consider their point of view on me.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">yesterday I heard my neighbors having sex again. there was no outside noise and my refrigerator wasn&apos;t running. they were really going at it. I must have heard only the end because the noise stopped after a couple minutes.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">I haven&apos;t mentioned u/sustainablesmile yet. for the past couple weeks we&apos;ve been messaging on reddit, after she (a girl from germany) replied to a post I made on r/lonely inviting me to pm her. so I did. but at this point the topics have gotten mundane.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">before I messged u/sustainablesmile, a different user messaged me first and we ended up adding each other on whatsapp. but the conversation with him died even more quickly.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">the touchpeak office was very empty last week since several of them flew abroad to the denmark office. this week they&apos;re back and the Andrew was already talking about a girl he matched with on tinder who went back to his hotel room with him. today I was moved to sit next to the Zach. he seems nice.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
10-31 t</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">the weather is finally cooling down again. once daylight savings ends on sunday, it&apos;ll be dark again too.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;"><br/></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Segoe UI;">today is halloween. but to me, just another shitty, stupid day.</span></div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">10-2 t</span></div><div><br/></div><div>the cmb conversation with this Amy has been flowing fairly steadily. I&apos;ve been making sure to reply more promptly than I did during the weekend. doing my best to not get stuck in my head too much, to stave off the anxiety. I&apos;m already leaping and bounding. imagining her coming over, getting close to her, touching her. I don&apos;t know what she sounds like yet. what she&apos;s like yet. it&apos;s nice to see that I&apos;ve come a longish way, yet this precipice I&apos;m so precariously perched on can give way to only one of two outcomes. something happens that changes me forever, or nothing happens. my mind is boiling and I don&apos;t know what to think, or how to control my thoughts. I told cody and dorothy about her, and dorothy asked for a pic; initially I was hesitant because I wasn&apos;t sure if this Amy was cute enough. not the best thought, but I sent one without delaying too long and they were reasonably encouraging, which was a relief.</div><div><br/></div><div>twice today I encountered a strange-looking person who I thought was a guy but clearly had a girl&apos;s voice, wearing loose basketball shorts. her (?) right foot looked slightly injured and she (?) was walking slowly, with a limp. I tried slipping by her, muttering &quot;excuse me&quot; under my breath and she was taken by surprising and said I scared the shit out of her. I awkwardly said sorry while smiling. later when I ran into her the second time she said &quot;we meet again.&quot; I held open a door for her and she wished me a great day. I was awkward.</div><div><br/></div><div>there was some free food at stationside with some &quot;fall fest&quot; event going on, and when I went to get some the short girl who works there recognized me and said hey. I only said a &quot;hi&quot; back, and nothing else.</div><div><br/></div><div>I matched with a Caroline on cmb today.</div><div><br/></div><div>today I took a tiny step towards rewriting some of the rba23 code. it&apos;s almost no progress at all, but more importantly it marks my beginning to move away from the Kumar&apos;s code. I&apos;ve heard nothing from the Gorm about how to proceed with this, despite Anthony telling me that he should have talked to me. I heard from the Spencer at three dollar cafe that the future of the company actually looks quite promising, with a lot of potential for expansion. we&apos;re on track to move into a different building later this year. Anthony and Rashida discussed some halloween plans to go to a strip club. these are the sorts of things that make me want to stay with the company; just knowing that there&apos;s all this opportunity magically here. is surreal.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">10-3 w</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>let me get this out of the way first, I was forced to ride bitch again on the way to and from lunch today due to Richard and Blessed, who physically pulled me away from the front passenger seat when I got there first. I don&apos;t know how to smoothly handle this situation without making myself look like an asshole and it&apos;s making me anxious. I didn&apos;t even want to write this out.</div><div><br/></div><div>today I gave the Amy my phone number after she asked me for it, and we&apos;ve been texting all day. it feels like we&apos;ve been talking forever, but it&apos;s been less than a week. I actually feel like it&apos;s a little too much and started to find it off-putting, even a little exhausting. maybe I made the same mistake myself with that Caroline, because she never answered after I asked her for her number too. I didn&apos;t really think it through and perhaps it was too much at once on my part.</div><div><br/></div><div>I went to petunia&apos;s workplace again to pick up my replacement frame. after today I decided to trust him a little more. he talked a bit about his interactions with other players in galcon 2, including a bit of drama with sidepocket and a couple others I haven&apos;t seen in-game. it was once again reassuring seeing his coworkers comfortable with him, and he&apos;s told at least one of them about me. she addressed me as &quot;moxi&quot; and seemed somewhat familiar with the conversation on galcon 2. he showed me a note on his phone with a long list of players he has information on, including me. my entry included my name, age, and the fact that I&apos;ve never been in a relationship before. and that I was &quot;very sweet.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">10-4 r</span></div><div><br/></div><div>the anxiety from yesterday carried over to today and spiked to the point where I lost my appetite for much of the day. I wonder if what I&apos;m feeling toward the Richard is the same that I once felt towards Anthony.</div><div><br/></div><div>I stopped answering the Amy&apos;s texts earlier this afternoon. wonder if I&apos;m making her feel bad or anxious...if I am, it&apos;s not my intention.</div><div><br/></div><div>I met with dorothy for dinner tonight at a tiny little run-down looking taco restaurant that Anthony Bourdain supposedly once visited. the food was flavorful and the conversation flowed...she was of course interested in the Amy, and I showed her our text conversation so far. she said I was all good. I also showed her my cmb profile, and she immediately said to get rid of the picture I put in there of me and Barb. showing myself off with a girl was never my intention with that pic, but the important thing is that it would almost certainly come across that way. she offered to come down to the run group this saturday to take a better replacement photo(s) of me at the park.</div><div><br/></div><div>dorothy let me see her own profile, forgetting that her age was displayed there, so I know how old she is now. I was off by one year. the end of bojack horseman s1e7 would fit well. we had a good talk in which I mentioned feeling depressed for part of college life. dorothy understood that as me being vulnerable, and appreciated it.</div><div><br/></div><div>the Karen messaged me back after a week.</div><div><br/></div><div>I matched a second Caroline on cmb. the same one I matched with on tinder months ago. the one with just two pictures and a vague, nearly empty profile. I showed her to dorothy too, and she said that she&apos;s cute.</div><div><br/></div><div>if anything happens tomorrow, I just hope I don&apos;t get too tongue-tied.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">10-5 f</span></div><div><br/></div><div>tonight I went on what was possibly my first ever proper date.</div><div><br/></div><div>I didn&apos;t think much of it in the hours leading up to it. not while driving cody to the marta station. not while showering. not while getting dressed. I put on my lanvin sneakers.</div><div><br/></div><div>when I walked out from the parking garage I began entering an altered state of consciousness.</div><div><br/></div><div>I paced around the candy store for a few minutes. mistook a girl and guy for my date (thought she might have come accompanied by a friend; this shows the state of my mind from the very beginning) and hid from them. only to look up and see her in person, walking up to me. I said a &quot;hey&quot;. it started immediately. I could feel it as soon as we each opened a door to walk into the store. she didn&apos;t know about stranger things, I couldn&apos;t explain what it was. I wasn&apos;t genuinely interested in the rest of the candy. we found the cotton candy and I bought it. I didn&apos;t feel proud of anything during the checkout.</div><div><br/></div><div>overall, it wasn&apos;t terrible, wasn&apos;t a *total* disaster. that&apos;s what I&apos;m clinging on to. I&apos;m desperately looking to dorothy et al. for validation.</div><div><br/></div><div>every mistake can be chalked up to altered state of mind. she asked me icebreaker questions that I couldn&apos;t answer. I can never answer those. it felt like an interview, but it really shouldn&apos;t have. we were awkwardly walking and talking and couldn&apos;t decide on what to do, ending up at the midtown pho king, of all places, after I drove us there. of course I had no appetite and the pho wasn&apos;t good anyway. I kept thinking of the food quality as a reflection of our date quality. I told her my &quot;cult&quot; story and she seemed entertained. she paid for herself because she was able to put her card in the check holder as I was holding it awkwardly, and I didn&apos;t know what to do. I had no response when she asked me why I&apos;m paying for everything, and now of course I do.</div><div><br/></div><div>after that we went straight back to (her car). she brought up the topic of weed, that we&apos;d discussed earlier, and spent the last stint of the date debating with herself out loud about whether or not she wanted to come over to my place and try it for the first time. oddly, I was not on board with that and found a way out, framing it as giving her time to think about it. and thank god, because I was not ready to have her over at my place. although it&apos;s nice that...she was apparently willing to come here? at the end we silently hugged...and left. I&apos;d let her pay for her own parking.</div><div><br/></div><div>so much felt wrong, despite there being no singular point of collapse. I suppose that&apos;s just how it inevitably feels outside the comfort zone. I have to fly through this storm if I ever want to get out. of course I sent her a follow-up text. if I never hear from her again...that would suck. despite leaving the door open for a next time, and hearing her reference the same.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">10-7 n</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>I don&apos;t remember what the Amy looks like. I woke up yesterday morning thinking about what had happened the previous night, and how surreal it was to know. waiting to see if she would answer my text was like failing a job interview but still vainly hoping that they&apos;ll call back. I ran alone at the park, and skipped breakfast and bjj again to meet with dorothy for an early lunch.</div><div><br/></div><div>she asked me about how it went last night. I was a little relieved that she didn&apos;t seem to think any of things I&apos;d done were too stupid. she pointed out that maybe the Amy didn&apos;t respond because of the way I&apos;d worded my text about the weed; maybe she too didn&apos;t know that &quot;mary jane&quot; was a slang term and thought I was talking about an actual person. it&apos;s an outdated term anyway. but that too was overly hopeful; I&apos;m not hearing from her again. funny how it did in fact come crashing down. faster than I would ever have predicted. I even resorted to using petunia as a shoulder to lean on.</div><div><br/></div><div>this is hard to write, but I noticed today that &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE had apparently unfriended or blocked me on steam. he&apos;s not on my friends list anymore. it&apos;s unlikely that he did something accidentally, so I&apos;m assuming it was intentional, and I&apos;m guessing he did it some time around when he sent the text reading &quot;I don&apos;t know why we&apos;re friends.&quot; the last day we played was september 21, so some time within the last two weeks. is this really the end?</div><div><br/></div><div>this weekend felt extra empty, even with only cody out of town. he and dorothy are my only friends here now. not Barb, not David, not anybody else. I&apos;ve been communicating with dorothy more lately. she&apos;s hosting another movie night tonight, and nearly everyone declined, save for the &quot;Davd&quot; from that TAP event weeks ago, and David. dorothy&apos;s a little too preoccupied with the potential drama between our group&apos;s members, and what people might think of her. confiding in me that she suspected that Barb informed David of what she&apos;d said about him last week, because Barb&apos;s &quot;an idiot&quot;, and that David must now be mad at her because of something he&apos;d posted to facebook earlier, and because he hadn&apos;t responded to her movie invite message. when he likely simply hadn&apos;t seen the message yet. because soon after she told me all that, David responded in messenger saying that he&apos;ll be there.</div><div><br/></div><div>Hannah and I never did any catching up last week, and probably never will anymore. why do I keep losing people?</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">10-8 m</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>it must have been some time earlier this year that my previously habitual reminiscing of so-and-so time of year x years ago faded to a halt. it doesn&apos;t feel like october. it never will, until well after october. or whatever month it might be.</div><div><br/></div><div>last night at dorothy&apos;s we met Heather&apos;s boyfriend Joona, a guy from finlad whom she met online somewhere. he reminded me a little of the Martin from work, just because he&apos;s european and shit. his hair looked slightly greasy and he was really skinny. had a slight accent, would probably have been a little more awkward if it weren&apos;t for the beer. he and Heather make one of the odd couples.</div><div><br/></div><div>the bald &quot;Davd&quot; from the last TAP event I went to was there, and he was a new character for me to form judgments towards. again, the parts of him I didn&apos;t like were parts we shared.</div><div><br/></div><div>the Heather and Joona pair left without seeing the movie, so it was just me, dorothy, Davd, and David watching &apos;hereditary&apos;. it was my second watch and I had kind of been hoping to see it with a larger crowd. but the only specific&nbsp;&nbsp;members I&apos;d had in mind were just cody and barb, and I was perfectly fine without those two. the movie was fine. David fell silent towards the end, staring at his phone, and interrupting the conversation by bringing up a book he was reading, that had nothing to do with what we were talking about. dorothy and I exchanged glances every time this occurred.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">10-9 t</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>so it actually happened today; Blessed took Zach aside shortly after he walked into the office, and shortly after that, he quietly escorted him out. and just like that, Zach was gone. he had been with the company for around three years at this point, and his time came to a sudden and unceremonious end. Ben said that he&apos;ll probably end up working at like burger king or some shit. that poor fucker. how many of the others knew of this impending departure? I think Zach had no idea. I can imagine the weight of having something like that happen to you. the upending of routine, the embarrassment. it&apos;s unlikely that we&apos;ll ever hear from him again.</div><div><br/></div><div>on a related note, the Michael included in his announcement that the JP would also be (voluntarily) leaving next week. so there&apos;s another departure after a period of employment of less than a year.</div><div><br/></div><div>in other news, my own one-year anniversary is in ten days.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">10-11 r</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>Ben and I having discussions about the state of things and people at the company.</div><div><br/></div><div>last night I journeyed all the way to the mall of georgia to pick up an apple watch series 4 that I&apos;d ordered. I was only slightly excited. the mall was huge and mostly empty by the time I got there. the guy at the store I talked to about my order seemed excited for me when I told him it was my&nbsp;&nbsp;first apple watch, and shook my hand.</div><div><br/></div><div>I rode in Danny&apos;s car today, his civic type r, to lunch. he&apos;s kept it spotless, and liked keeping the engine at <a dir="ltr" href="tel:3000-4000">3000-4000</a> rpm. I wonder how much he was showing it off, if at all. I thought the ride wasn&apos;t smooth, especially with his shifting, and the suspension was too stiff. I commented on the cleanliness, which marks a departure from my usual habit of trying to come across as unimpressed.</div><div><br/></div><div>I experienced a brief surge of anxiety this morning and texted my mom about it, eventually not replying anymore. I almost don&apos;t like it when the anxiety goes away. because the cause of it isn&apos;t addressed, so the core problem isn&apos;t being fixed, and the anxiety itself is free to return.</div><div><br/></div><div>this idiot at the gym trying to lift way too much weight for him. &quot;bench pressing&quot; 255 lbs, most likely trying to impress the guy on the bench next to him working out with a really hot girl. I later saw the idiot attempting something resembling bent-over rows, again with over 225 lbs. I myself found that I wasn&apos;t able to lift as much as I was two weeks ago, due to skipping.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">10-13 s</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>I read my journal entry on the 12th of last year and I realize that I feel exactly the same about october this year as I did then.</div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday I met with petunia for the fourth time. to adjust my glasses frame again, but I&apos;m still having trouble with the fit. I didn&apos;t give him my rainbow donut. he invited me to hang out with his friends at the gay pride parade on sunday, but I&apos;m not interested in meeting his friends.</div><div><br/></div><div>last night</div><div><br/></div><div>shoya</div><div><br/></div><div>dorothy wanted to sit next to me because she didn&apos;t want to have to share food with Jay and someone else, probably Tia. Jay looked happy to see Claire. Tuan brought with him a tall white girl who apparently was his date. Tia and Claire were both wearing turtleneck sweaters and I liked the look. Tia also brought someone with her, a white whom she turns out to have been dating for the past several months, according to her. and Barb, Li, Heather, and Joona were there too. I shared with dorothy and we go the same foods as we had previously. at one point, Tia asked me about the girl Yims. the focus changed to horror movies, and I didn&apos;t chime in when they were talking about &apos;the ring&apos;. after we finished eating, Barb hugged me while we were standing outside. she was wearing black jeans, which looked good on her.</div><div><br/></div><div>afterwards we migrated to a bubble tea place in the same plaza as sweet hut. it was completely empty save for us. I was part of the subgroup with dorothy, Li, Tia, and her date, and it was mostly dorothy and Tia talking about David for a while. I thought she was exaggerating about him again, but Tia nodded knowingly. dorothy told everyone about the other short guy at the run group who David apparently feels intimidated by. I was sitting next to Barb. the focus then transitioned to me and how I feel about Yims, and here is where I failed several times; I felt that dorothy&apos;s presentation of the facts skewed them quite a bit, particularly when it came to the degree to which I judged Yims by her manner of dress. and I did almost nothing to defend myself, in fact hardly saying anything at all. dorothy then announced that she was going to say something about my background, and I became slightly nervous because I thought she was about to tell everyone that I had never been in a relationship before. what she actually revealed was my &quot;christian&quot; past, except she once again worded it extremely poorly, telling it as me having &quot;pretended&quot; to have been christian. that I clarified, partially well. Barb briefly put a hand on my leg, I guess to comfort me? perhaps she could tell that I was slightly uncomfortable. and I was grateful towards her, but totally failed at expressing it. for some reason, with her I&apos;m still afraid of the camaraderie. she mentioned being on tinder, and (jokingly) that we both need to have some more bad dating experiences, and I could have made a lighthearted quip of some kind, but instead I said nothing.</div><div><br/></div><div>later that night, dorothy texted me and reassured me that I appeared natural and at ease while she was talking about me. and that she was proud. I guess...that means something to me.</div><div><br/></div><div>today</div><div><br/></div><div>this morning David showed up, and I realized that the short jacked dude I&apos;d seen multiple times in previous weeks is the guy he&apos;s &quot;afraid&quot; of. Barb appeared and I sat with her, taking small pieces of the pumpkin bread she offered me. still scared to look at her. then Tia appeared as well, and asked for a ride to the sandy springs farmer&apos;s market, where Dorothy and Jay agreed to meet afterwards. so I waited at Jason&apos;s deli with Barb and the short guy, half-listening to him ramble about nutrition-related things while all the women at the table, including Barb, gave him their attention. as we were leaving, I heard him say to her that he&apos;ll catch up with her later.</div><div><br/></div><div>the farmer&apos;s market was kind of boring, and I talked only a little with Tia on the way there. we were on the same page when it came to religion. I didn&apos;t like most of the offerings at the market, and only ate two muffins that cost $6.</div><div><br/></div><div>Jacob made a joke today in class that I didn&apos;t understand, I think poking fun at the fact that I hadn&apos;t been there for a while. I rolled with him for the first time. Mallory commented on my nails again, and I had no response...again. she gave me an unexpected hug, and made some joke too? asking me if I&apos;d be back again &quot;this year&quot;. I replied, &quot;once or twice.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div>after that I met with Dorothy at…chinatown…in a plaza with a dim sum restaurant called Oriental Pearl which I realized I had visited with Krish over three years ago. the food court looked like it was out of a chinese supermarket, and the food tasted so too. it was good. we two were the only ones. she noticed my shoes and thought they were new.</div><div><br/></div><div>there, we discussed that Jay probably wouldn&apos;t make a great travel partner because he&apos;s always tight on funds. I showed her the pictures I&apos;d taken in china when I last went 4+ years ago. she liked the ones of me and of me and my mom, thinking they were sweet.</div><div><br/></div><div>a bigger revelation that Dorothy revealed to me is that Heather&apos;s boyfriend Joona &quot;doesn&apos;t work&quot;, i.e. has no job, and the cited reason was anxiety. which runs in contrast with what we&apos;ve seen; he seemed pretty normal when it came to social interactions. but because he makes no money, Heather&apos;s been paying for everything for him throughout his stay here, to the point where she&apos;s had to lower her 401k contributions. that seems slightly extreme, and I can&apos;t help but think that she&apos;s willing to do that for him because she might not find anyone else who&apos;d want to be with her. or maybe he&apos;s just that great of a guy. I also wasn&apos;t sure what to make of dorothy&apos;s telling me this information, which seems like something Heather would want to keep private. maybe she trusts me that much.</div><div><br/></div><div>lastly, a girl in white camo leggings who I&apos;d stared at several times, and even made eye contact with without recognizing, turned out to be the Jennifer Kwon. I didn&apos;t realize this until I saw Dorothy make a face of realization and Jennifer came up behind me and slapped her hands on my shoulder. I wish I could say that I&apos;m glad she feels comfortable enough to do that, but again, that&apos;s just her. she was with a tall Chinese guy who I can only assume is her boyfriend or fiance or husband, no idea which, and I finally noticed her ring.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m currently at Dorothy&apos;s place with Heather and Joona, where we&apos;re preparing to watch the 40-year-old virgin because I don&apos;t want to keep pushing to watch horror movie when they don&apos;t enjoy them.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">10-15 m</span></div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;ve been hanging out with dorothy quite a bit lately. last night I had dinner with her again, at shoya again, this time with the Ben, whom she invited despite always claiming to find him annoying. it was the first opportunity in a while that I had to observe him. he was wearing a poorly fitting peachtree fire department t-shirt, and ugly pants and shoes. he talked with dorothy about that Nancy, and I heard him justifying her behavior a lot. he said that she does indeed pay him rent to live in his master bedroom. dorothy tapped/poked me in the leg under the table a couple times; I think she intended that to be her cue for me to say something, but I kind of ignored it. when Ben left to use the bathroom or something, she immediately launched into how much of a &quot;trainwreck&quot; he is, and immediately switched back to normal the moment he returned. I was surprised to learn that he&apos;d gone out once or twice with the girl Brittany from the running meetup group. I imagine she doesn&apos;t get much, either. but I could just be wrong again.</div><div><br/></div><div>at tea top next door, I listened to Ben justify not making the time to do any exercise. throughout the evening he kept clearing his throat and displayed body language that just seemed sort of unconfident. he also ordered a ramen dish, but ate everything in it except for the noodles. dorothy really railed against him afterwards, comparing him to a cockroach.</div><div><br/></div><div>cody returned from europe today, and we ate dinner at papi&apos;s after I picked him up from the midtown marta station. maybe he&apos;ll have a healthier conversation with other people, but we still talked some about his trip. he went paragliding in switzerland, the country that stood out the most among the ones he visited. then he showed me a selfie that a busty girl he met on bumble sent him, explaining that they&apos;re planning to meet later this week after they&apos;d been talking for a couple weeks already. I kept it simple when he remembered to ask me how my own date two fridays ago had gone, only stating that I never heard from her again. I didn&apos;t use the term &quot;ghosted&quot;. he seemed slightly awkward when he told me to keep trying and never give up. even though I&apos;m feeling twinges of that awful longing, I&apos;d rather he remain comfortable with sharing his own experiences with me. I don&apos;t want to make him feel like he should hide them from me because I might be too sensitive or something.</div><div><br/></div><div>in other news, it looks like the times with &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE and Sir Boolean are indeed over for good, as Sir Boolean appears to have blocked me as well; whereas a few days ago I was still able to few his steam profile, it now appears as private. my only remaining connection then is Tracy. and I think I fell out of her favor a while ago, too.</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s taken me three days or so to realize that I&apos;d forgotten a call to ICommunicator.open(). and the anxieties I&apos;d been feeling about my job just melt away at even the smallest hint of the illusion of progress.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">10-17 w</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>I had been starting to feel annoyed towards work!Ben&apos;s nonsensical antics, such as his incessantly asking me what I got for lunch every day. I was sort of ignoring him at the office and online on steam yesterday as well. but then he offered a clarification of some sort, stating that he meant me no harm. which pushed my forgiveness button, and I started being more vulnerable with him about how I feel towards work and Blessed. it would seem that we&apos;re both getting annoyed with him.</div><div><br/></div><div>the JP left today, with no fanfare and little farewell. at lunchtime he went up to everyone and shook their hands; it took me a moment to recognize what he was doing when he came up to me. he said &quot;best of luck&quot; and I just said &quot;see ya&quot; after a second of hesitation. and that was all that he needed. at lunch today I heard Anthony say that he thought JP probably wasn&apos;t as well-versed technically as he said he was.</div><div><br/></div><div>I tried starting a conversation today with another cmb match, and it seeming died right off the bat. I vented to dorothy about it and ended up following her advice to ask to meet. after hours of silence, I was ready to write it off, as well contemplating venting to dorothy again, but the girl actually replied with a yes-but-not-until-next-month, which I&apos;m not sure what to make of.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">10-19 f</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>late night writings</div><div><br/></div><div>today was my one-year anniversary at touchpeak. only Ben noticed. I worked a little with Anthony on some of the rba code. I noticed the skin on his hands looked dry and scabby.</div><div><br/></div><div>I couldn&apos;t resist sending &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE another random text. he replied, but not for long. I don&apos;t know if he realizes that I know he unfriended me. I&apos;m finding myself looking for reassurance that he doesn&apos;t yet want to completely cut me out from his life.</div><div><br/></div><div>dinner at the indian restaurant zyka with dorothy and cody. he called me and we briefly hung out at my place, for a few minutes, before I drove us to the lenox mall, where I returned two of the three apple watches I bought. we walked around the nike store for a bit too. before then heading to zyka, where it was loud and lively. dorothy arrived and cody talked about his europe trip, then about his Brittany. I tried to not focus on any jealousy I might have, of having so many girls come on to him. dorothy&apos;s reactions are almost too matter-of-fact. we trash talked Ben some more, and cody used the term &apos;cuck&apos; on him again, and also on that one girl&apos;s boyfriend whom he&apos;d told me about on monday.</div><div><br/></div><div>at momonoki, where we went for a dessert afterwards, dorothy revealed to cody that Heather&apos;s boyfriend doesn&apos;t work. and cody&apos;s reaction was more honest than mine; he called him a cuck too, whereas I&apos;d been afraid to call out the bullshit as readily as cody did.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">10-21&nbsp;n</span></div><div><br/></div><div>I barely noticed the leaves beginning to fall, but sometime in the past few weeks, the temperature finally began to drop, and the sun began setting earlier.</div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday I was so fatigued from bjj that I took a nap in the afternoon, and it was dark when I woke up. I loved the surreal feeling. I&apos;d rolled with Jacob again, and he said that I needed to come more often. literally all I said was, &quot;yeah.&quot; I don&apos;t feel any hostility between me and Jacob or Mallory, but there&apos;s still no connection either. there was a blue belt guy there who was much more aggressive than anyone I&apos;d gone with for a while, so I was really struggling to defend the entire time.</div><div><br/></div><div>I passed on a couple opportunities today, one with dorothy, Jay, Tia, and some others, and another with Nita and the asian meetup group. Nita invited me to one of their board game sessions, which I wasn&apos;t interested in. it was in the same place as it was the first and last time I went, last december, when I met that Amanda.</div><div><br/></div><div>the other group thing that Tia initiated was at some ethiopian restaurant, which dorothy later texted me about, saying it sucked, that the food was trash and the people were annoying.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m afraid to mention this, but here it is; I started talking with a Jordan on tinder, and she at least seems interested in talking. for now. wasn&apos;t expecting that, and I need to continue to have no expectations.</div><div><br/></div><div>so I was inside by myself all weekend, and it felt stifling and wasteful. unproductivity, when it occurs, weighs down on me much more heavily than it used to. it&apos;s hard to believe that I regularly spend all of my weekends like this.</div><div><br/></div><div>one year ago, I went to the running meetup for the first time and met cody there.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">10-24 w</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>work!Ben has made several body-positive comments towards me. I guess my time at the gym is paying off in some way. there was difficulty getting to work today because of a big accident that occurred right outside the building, so half of the office or so just stayed home. I didn&apos;t get in until 3 pm. while at home, Ben and I had more conversation lamenting the state of our roles at the company. I texted my dad again, once more resolving to leave this job. only to think about the &quot;potential&quot; yet again, and decide that it would be more comfortable to stay...for now. always for now.</div><div><br/></div><div>dorothy messaged about another TAP event, coincidentally at momonoki, so I went after winning another round of trivia at three dollar cafe with Danny, Anthony, and Rashida. I got a brief glimpse of the Ben and the Ai-Ping, but they left almost immediately after I got there. I stayed with dorothy and Li, saw the Justine there, who recognized me and shook my hand, and caught a glimpse of the Jennifer too. didn&apos;t really talk to anyone new this time either. dorothy and Li both liked Justine. I think she&apos;s cute too.</div><div><br/></div><div>add some more bits of trivia that I learned from dorothy: that the Ai-Ping is a 44-year-old virgin who couldn&apos;t stop talking about his girlfriend when he had one, and that he keeps the Ben around because he looks worse than him by comparison. do I find myself wanting all of this to be true? if it is, they live such sad, pathetic lives.</div><div><br/></div><div>both Rashida and dorothy commented on my haircut.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">10-28 n</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>learn to not go into unnecessary detail</div><div><br/></div><div>there was some confusion over the dinner and afterparty plans yesterday. first dorothy came over to my place and I drove us to the vortex. we scored a spot on the same block, so there wasn&apos;t much walking to do. we were the first at the restaurant, which was an anxiety-inducing place with dim lighting, little space, and loud background noise. provocative decorations and indoor smoking. I was sporting the mcqueen jacket for the first time since march or so this year. Barb and Tia were being flaky in their messaging, so after Jay arrived we stopped waiting for them and got seated. dorothy was quite frustrated with them.</div><div><br/></div><div>the food was delicious</div><div><br/></div><div>Barb arrived partway through, after she had already eaten her own dinner, with Tia. throughout dinner, I found that I kept avoiding looking at her and Jay, just because I was afraid they&apos;d start talking to me and I&apos;d have nothing to say. which happened when Barb asked a generic &quot;what&apos;s new with you?&quot; she mentioned going on a third date with the Chris (!!!), the short guy from the run group who&apos;s known to us as David&apos;s competition. although I thought that earlier that morning, I had heard him mention seeing a girl for a year. dorothy offhandedly broke the news to her about cody dating somebody, and also mentioned that I went on a &quot;hot date&quot; too. it caught me off guard, because until that moment dorothy had not asked or mentioned anything about my date at all, and I was actually wondering if she had forgotten. Barb asked me some things like if I liked her, and I just gave a basic response. I definitely wasn&apos;t about to share anything with them at the table.</div><div><br/></div><div>I realized that I wasn&apos;t interested in hanging out with them afterwards. not with just BarbarianJay and potentially Claire. but I also wasn&apos;t interested in the halloween party that dorothy wanted to go to, because she had already bought her ticket for it (and was the only one to have done so). when we were all outside discussing plans and dorothy asked if I&apos;d come check out the party with her, I said a flat no initially, but when she pressed me again afterwards, I realized that she probably wanted me to be with her, so I agreed.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">10-29 m</span></div><div><br/></div><div>the halloween party was a nightmare alright. I let dorothy go in first just to check it out, and was perfectly content waiting an estimated 15 min out in my car. but then she came back and ended up persuading me to go in, even buying me the $30 ticket. of course there were a lot of people in costume. this was the closest to the halloween spirit that I&apos;ve been in so many years. but I&apos;m still not ready for it. stood still next to dorothy on the dance floor for a while, watching the other guys and girls effortlessly moving, before I put myself first and got out of there; she was kind enough to follow me. we sat at a table and I tried to make her understand how I don&apos;t enjoy this type of activity. the room wasn&apos;t crowded yet and there was still some room to sit and think. the TAP people appeared shortly after; I saw the Jennifer dressed as a zombie as she ran up to me and pretended to bite me. she asked what I was doing sitting by myself. dorothy talked to the rest of them as they filed in, and I sat quietly nearby, in no mood to socialize and making no attempt. I noticed Jennifer&apos;s boyfriend also sitting quietly. the small girl I saw on wednesday, dressed as harley quinn, I heard her asking to go in and dance. and I just thought about how foreign it is to me, the idea of actually looking forward to this dancing, and having fun doing it, and just being able to relax enough to enjoy the thing at all.</div><div><br/></div><div>I drove us back to my place, still trying to explain how I felt to dorothy, but we&apos;re worlds apart. she mentioned that a lot of the guys there were &quot;too asian&quot; with the Wellington being an example of an exception. I didn&apos;t notice because I paid more attention to the girls. we ended up staying up until 1:30 or so, watching the movie &apos;triangle&apos;. and it was fun to just have someone over and relax. and nice to not have to drive home afterwards.</div><div><br/></div><div>sunday</div><div><br/></div><div>dorothy comes over again to drive me to the Tuan&apos;s place, for his movie night planned nearly a month ago. before she arrives, Barb calls me, and I ignore her because I&apos;m afraid she&apos;s going to ask for a ride or something. a minute or two later, she posts in the facebook event asking for anyone to pick her up because someone followed her into a publix. I feel guilty.</div><div><br/></div><div>we drive to Tuan&apos;s and I think dorothy reiterates her exasperation towards how Barb and Tia think they&apos;re hot shit. we get lucky enough to score a free parking spot after some confusion, and encounter Li in the lobby. Barb is already up in Tuan&apos;s room, on the 18th floor. we get up there and it&apos;s the quintessential millennial pad. a wall mounted bike, trinkets and gadgets everywhere. a wii, electric keyboard, ipad, laptop, what looked like a microsoft surface, wall-mounted tv that it was streaming to, a robot vacuum. Tia arrives last, with her Stan, who I just realize is shorter than her. she brings a ton of healthy but gross-looking food that no one else wants to eat. microwaved some prepackaged salad that smelled bad. I never give Barb an excuse as to why I didn&apos;t answer her call.</div><div><br/></div><div>the movie we settle on is &apos;searching&apos;, which I&apos;m good with, because the trailer I saw months ago captivated me. I say nothing about the character I suspect the most, but I turn out to be right. I get frustrated at Li sitting next to me, gasping and seemingly falling for every obvious red herring. at least Tuan makes a point to not give any of the plot points away this time. dorothy suggests that it&apos;s because we were at his place, and he wants to be in control. on the way back, she acknowledges that he isn&apos;t attractive.</div><div><br/></div><div>...</div><div><br/></div><div>whenever Ben messages me on steam, the alert sound makes me think of &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE. Ben and I still vent our frustrations about work to each other on there.</div><div><br/></div><div>and I&apos;ve been texting Jordan too. things seem to be going so fragilely well.</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><b>10-31 w</b></div></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>Jordan and I had our second Date at el taco veloz, another place I learned about through dorothy. stepping into it felt familiar and foreign at the same time. I was again in between awkward and comfortable as we sat and ate together in between our small talk. she let me take bites directly from her tacos. after finishing there, we settled on kung fu tea for another bubble tea dessert. I had forgotten where that was, and she suggested taking one car there because the parking was tight, so I drove. and she did take the initiative to pay for my bubble tea, as I had covered dinner. we continued talking there, I making sure the occasional silence didn&apos;t bother me too much. I mentioned bjj to her, and she mentioned having a pair of yeezys. we discussed our wardrobes and clothes shopping habits for a while, finding some common ground there. I thought the tea and boba weren&apos;t as good as what I got at tea top a few weeks ago.</div><div><br/></div><div>I drove us back to where Jordan had parked at the restaurant, and we both knew what it was time for. problem was I still sat nervously and awkwardly, and I feel like most other girls wouldn&apos;t have been as patient with me. I don&apos;t know what I did or said to initiate it, but I remember her saying that she was waiting for me to make my move. it was dark and relatively secluded in the car, and somehow I initiated the make-out sesh. this went on for some time, with some pauses and breaks in between when we saw or heard people walking or driving by. I don&apos;t know if anyone saw us going at it. it was a little heavier and slightly more intense than last time, with her putting her hand on my neck, and with me eventually sliding my hand to her chest, cupping and softly squeezing her breast. she let out a few soft, small moans. I was more comfortable with it this time. but, I still made it too known that I was interested in her sexually, and she made a comment about maybe, eventually, &quot;giving [me] what [I] want.&quot; I don&apos;t want to seem needy.</div><div><br/></div><div>it turns out that I had overheard Anthony correctly yesterday, about a laptop for me. today, the second package came, containing the one meant for me, and the Robbie was fighting with it and the other one, trying to install additional memory. Blessed walked over and clarified that I&apos;ll be using linux on it. no problem, I thought, I survived three years at my previous job using linux. we should be preparing to transition into the other building by next month. meanwhile, thanksgiving is a mere three weeks away. I wish not to jinx it by thinking about too much, but I can&apos;t help but wonder if I can lose my virginity by the end of the year. what if I did just now, just by typing this.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

september 1:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>here is everything i remember tonight:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>pregaming with patrick in stephen csukas' room. rahul, ethan, and kush are here as welll. i have a bit of kraken/coke as well as malibu black/coke. i'm already drrunk by the time fowler drives us to the house that mike's house marty is at. i hug elizabeth, dana, mike, csukas, and everyone else these. allison wu is there, to my tremendous surprise.  patrick and i and bunch of others go outside to smoke. brooke reminds us once again that weed is good. i'm gonne have more about the pregame to say tomorrow. elizabeth and freeman gave me a hug, albiet one-armed. i remember talking about heather, brooke suggesting weed instead of cigars, and hanging out a lot outside of the house smoking cigars and cigarettes. tried talking to allison a lot of times. used the bathroom about five times. mike directed me to it. it was really weird seeing allison there with her boyfriend mitch. i was surprised peoiple knew him tooth. i think they said mitch didn't drink but allison did. the night was full of surprises. talked quite a bit with brooke and barely remember walking with her, kush, rahul and some..two other people walking her back to &quot;pike[s]&quot; before kush and i walked back to full west by ourselves. i walked to ULC and took the elevator alone. kush lives at eighth street. i'll write the rest of what i remember tomorrow. i tried concentrating at various points throughout the night but can't remember much. i'll see what i remember tomorrow.  well, i thought it was nice seeing brooke. i told her i loved her again. just like rome all over again, i said. she agreed. i'd like to be friends with her. ~</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
september 2:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>here is the rest of what i remember about last night:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i met up with patrick at the 5th street bridge and i bought a bottle of citrus smirnoff at mac's. then we went to csukas's room. patrick was rather surprisingly unfamiliar with the layout of west campus. he also said that there may be no barcelona reunion because it was never official. i had kraken and coke in a bottle. rahul hugged me and ethan and csukas shook my hand. kush and i didn't greet. they all called me already drunk simply because i was smiling and thought i made a grammar error. i'm not sure if they actually thought i was drunk. the room was dimly lit with blue ambient lighting. dana freeman and elizabeth fowler came too, with two friends of theirs i didn't know. they both gave me one-armed hugs. i noticed elizabeth gave csukas a much bigger hug. we played circle of death. during a never-have-i-ever i said i've never been high and data remembered the night outside wolf club when i took two hits off a joint. she called it a jay. i had malibu black. i was already drunk by the time we left the room. while going down the stairs i asked patrick if he was sober and he scoffed. elizabeth drove some of us with 4 in the backseat. she had only had half a beer. dana sat on presumably her boyfriend's lap. she didn't speed but it felt like she drove quickly, at least compared to the people whose cars i've been in. we parked in some small lot nearby and walked to wherever the party was. inside i saw mike and chip with people everywhere crowded around a beer pong table. i think i asked both of them for a hug. had some pineapple-y drink. saw someone who looked a lot like allison and realized it was actually her. at this point i lost track of where everyone was. i wanted a cigarette and patrick and i asked some people. i asked dana and she said she doesn't smoke much save for weed. i got a cig from someone somewhere. gave a hit to rahul i said &quot;and it's gone&quot; when i realized it was finished and threw it on the ground à la brad pitt in fight club. noticed brooke just then and i don't know if i hugged her or not. peter gave me a warm handshake, which surprised me. dimly remember seeing phil somewhere too. sanat was there. noticed alannah later. john dugan came by eventually too and i greeted him as &quot;mr. dugan.&quot; and paco and melaena, neither of whom said anything to me. i kept saying that i've never been this drunk at tech before. brooke and i talked about rome. things she said: she was drunk that night at rome too, weed is better than cigarettes, tyler practically carried both of us home, something about me being her favorite kid or something after i said i lover you to her again. i left with her, kush, and two others who i don't remember. she went to pike, which i now know is some fraternity or sorority house. i was quite drunk but even then hardly talked to kush as we walked silently past klaus and parted at hemphill. i took a shower and went to bed.</div>

september 4:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i forgot to restart 750 words on the month's first day.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i saw rahul this morning. he smiled widely but i didn't say anything. sanat acknowledged me for the first time since our first psych class, excluding saturday's party. csukas just looked at me. michelle looked away form me after i spotted her while walking towards her. i got out of databases class early today so i didn't see john outside the culc at the spot where we bumped into each other twice. he remembered though. no one else has acknowledged a regularly coincidental meeting spot before. i also saw sheng and kevin li and i just smiled at him although i didn't want to.</div>
<div><br/></div>

september 6:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i repeatedly caught myself feeling overly cynical during last night's small group. found some invisible fault with virtually every one of helen's, hannah's, allison's actions. i seemed to only like monique and david. allison didn't remember that her birthday is 6 days prior to mine. she only &quot;vaguely&quot; remembered when i reminded her that she was younger than me. i promised david that i'd finish reading 30 second religion by next week. we should be eating lunch together today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>that night i finished cat's cradle.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i didn't expect corrigan to be so warm when i met him while walking to class this morning. the last night i saw him he either didn't see me or ignored me, so i was readying myself for that again. i'm sure sidney saw me too when i walked past her at the CULC's rear entrance. she was in a uniform, with paco, leading a group of businessmen people. she ignored me too. i swear ryan and tanner glance at me out of the corners of their eyes, without ever acknowledging me. i want to stay out of rita's line of sight, and i'm sure she wants the same of me. she sits on the opposite side of the classroom from me now. ~</div>
<div><br/></div>

september 7:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i saw lisa today and she seemed really excited to see me, although we didn't hug but i think that might have been because there was a person between us. she said (again) that we should have lunch together. promised to text me this time. we'll see.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i arrived at ACF late and i never realized how many people say hi to me. i didn't want to smile again. melissa didn't come and i never saw her today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
september 15:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>nothing happened on my birthday yesterday. i met up with lisa and we had lunch together. she didn't let me pay her back. she didn't ask about barcelona as much as i was hoping she would. i barely talked to her about it at all. hanging out with her felt the same as it always did. we went to yogli mogli and i didn't notice a sign saying i could get free yogurt for my birthday. we talked about drinking and she mentioned hanging out again some time. okay. since we got frozen yogurt i missed/skipped my math class and saw sam on the way back. he and mike hung out in our living room. i stayed when they left early for ACF. steph gave me a present; she had remembered the notebook present we talked about over the summer. she didn't get me a pen though. and the notebooks are just moleskines. at ACF people said happy birthday. christina talked to me for the first time. steph gave me a hug. melissa didn't come. both dpak and enoch offered to pay for my dinner, but neither of them did because i ended up sharing with other people. i took some videos to think about using for an end-of-year video montage. i drank some vodka in my room before going to david's to play brawl with people. lisa called me because she had said she would try to stop by tonight. she didn't want to come inside and we just hung outside the ULC. she knows paco. i finally met her boyfriend. by the time i went back to david's everyone else had left and we watched thor. it was just me, david, steph, and sam, and i hate being with them when it's just them because steph's his girlfriend and sam's her brother. i always feel like an extra. everyone called me old today. no one's said that to me before.</div>
<div><br/></div>

september 21:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>back to feeling i have nothing to say. maybe i should save words for when i plan to restart my daily 750 come october.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i've only seen melissa once since the night she came over to my room, and that was for about a minute. i don't think i can label this as a let-down. we were supposed to have lunch together today but her work got in the way again. i guess i'll just be patient.</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>ray bradbury wrote over a thousand words every day for a while. it looks like this will continue to be my journal since i don't really want to use the cheap things steph got for me. maybe i'll use those as a primitive dream journal. i haven't written like this in almost 4 months and i feel like i'm stretching and recalibrating myself. which is good, tuning is good. this semester isn't feeding me a lot of actual homework, which means i've been playing the hare and napping until tests come up, before which i have to scramble to catch up on reading. i realized lately that i still spend most of my life here alone. i don't enjoy talking with sam anymore, or mike, or any of the guys i always wanted to be with last spring because it was easiest to feel like i had some friends when i was around them. i know i shouldn't be discounting them, but i've changed. i'm very, very malleable. i see newer people like david and steph (who feels newer because i've been able to quit feeling for her for good) at most twice a week, and still say little to them. my map is awfully sparse. i still haven't found an anchor to cling on to. the best candidate for that i've only seen 3 times since school started and i don't know how close we can get, nor am i able to attempt to foresee it because i don't have enough data. i'm breaking away from the mindset that i thought was the right one last year, and for now my refocus on grades and academics is steady. still keeping in mind the whole reformation-of-person thing that's afflicted me, and being genuine is sometimes easier when i'm drunk. i'm going to refuse to buy any new apple products, into shiny gleaming consumerism. yas. but i have taken on a sudden interest in the lego architecture models and am going to blow loads of money on that collection. i still sit at starbucks. i haven't talked to any of the new ACF members. i only like christina because she's diana's sister. i've talked to tom twice; before this month we hadn't chatted in almost 5 months. i don't exactly hang out with any of the people i'd come to know in barcelona either. so i remain forgettable despite my stories. i want to see melissa again. i still want everything to be clean. i've thrown away so much and wasted so much money. in the name of minimalism, apparently. i want to hug people like melissa and monique. i want to loosen up. i want to be at peace with my uncertainty. so now that that's all said, i'll be rekindling my 750 words routine for as long as i can. not everything is a fine dandy. i wrote that i found new demons that had been born in me to deal with too. i know what some of those are. i model different aspects of my behavior based on different people. some people i really don't want to smile at, some people apparently give off something that somehow has my lips stretching nigh ear to ear before i can even try to regain control of them..my spirit is at war with the cold, darkness, and evil in the world that smiles at me. yet just last night, the moon smiled at me too, and boy was it bright. it was so kind to me and i couldn't stop staring at its lovely face. and i could only see half of it. then i looked at maybe an acre or a half of the world that turns, and i thought, our world turns. einstein was pretty smart, wasn't he. he was a genius, he was. i believe i'm coming to the conclusion that god has to exist. and i'll believe that he's the creator of everything, and sure, it's nice of him to love us and if i love him when i'm able to see him, then i'll love him. but i don't see him anymore in our new room in one of the biotech buildings, in the stupid worship songs or the anguished expressions i imagine are on some peoples' faces. i don't hear him when i have passages from the bible read to me. i just see and hear people. all this religion religious ordeal is purely human, and i sincerely hope god didn't tell us to do that or want us to, because i think it's stupid. until i'm certain though, i'll always be afraid. that should be my life's goal. that'll be my end, and god will be my end and means.</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>lol so i lied</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>not writing the past two days. means i'll have to start with yesterdays and two days agos.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so two days ago. working with sally on the databases project was a little awkward at first, until i got myself up to speed by reading the project descriptions myself. i never really saw how bad a group worker i've been on past projects. i ran into our other teammate, sang, when i left her and he said we could work on it over the weekend in this seemingly wannabe confident manner that i could see myself adopting in the past. eh. nothing really happened during small group. allison talked about people constantly drinking in her apartment. jane gave another vague &quot;application.&quot; i said my &quot;application&quot; would be to eat an apple everyday. i already haven't held to it. aside from the one new person in our group, whose relationship status i don't know, i was the only single person in the room. i can feel myself becoming more and more afraid. lori, or laurie i don't know always has a huge backpack on her and she tried talking to me, asking for my name but i think i was in some especially heavy conversation-killing mood because the only word i said was my name. when we parted we said nothing. it was a little bit awful.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so yesterday. oh oops. that actually was all yesterday. that probably means nothing happened on tuesday.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i also saw tyler yesterday for the first time since school started. he mentioned a party sidney had held that i had never heard of. then i went to class. later i saw him at chick fil-a and ate with him so that was cool. his brother was with him. i told him their noses looked similar. they are going caving this weekend, led by none other than caroline. they kept trying to convince one of their roommates to go with them, who claimed to have caving before but was not eager at all to join. we walked to the crc together and i left them there.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today's sighting include anna, who i saw twice (neither of us acknowledged of course, and the second time i had to walk slowly behind her so she wouldn't see me), and csukas, who i saw in his car in the parking deck, and i waved to him. i went to the crc to swim by myself and caught mike at work.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night i drank half of what remained in my vodka bottle and held conversations with tom and amy. i told tom i was drunk. i just wanted to finish my vodka.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i want to deactivate my facebook account again. for the month of october. a clean 31 days it should be..</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>melissa i guess is always too busy working on stuff, perhaps for the anime convention this weekend so i haven't been able to see her in weeks. she's horribly unresponsive whether on facebook or through text.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the longer my dreams, the less i remember about them. i had two distinct nice long dreams that i forgot 95% of by the time i stood up out of bed. it's always so disappointing. they were somewhat awesome dreams too.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in psychology class today a clicker question asked us to rate how happy i am &quot;these days&quot; from 1 to 5, 5 being Very Happy. i answered 4, because i didn't want to answer with the neutral 3 but i'm not 4 out of 5 happy these days. i should have answered 2.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i want to avoid listening to some newfound music favorites listenings so they don't become less enjoyable. 'home' by edward sharpe and the magnetic zeros doesn't make me think instantly of europe/barcelona/the lisbon-fátima bus ride anymore. it might even make me think of this fall now. and ACF. ew. for now regina spektor's 'far' still takes me back to germany.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>reasons to not buy myself the new ipod nano it still won't hold all of my music i'll have to hide it from everyone i'll never be satisfied with what music i put on it extra cable to deal with</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>every time i think about getting a pumpkin spice latte from starbucks i suddenly become aware of how dehydrated i am and thus how i won't be able to enjoy my latte to the fullest. knowing too much about my brain works sucks sometimes. when it's not in a way that lets me hack it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>one</div>

september 30:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>shit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i thought ACF olympics would be stupid, and they were stupid, except nobody else cared. i bought potato chips from a vending machine before going, and they got stuck at first but i ended up getting two bags of potato chips. afterwards i wished i hadn't got potato chips. steph made a gross face, i think, at the potato chips. i tore off the number in the corner of the name tag helen gave me because i didn't want to participate. instead i took videos of everyone to use for an end-of-semester video. i thought the team cheers everyone came up with were stupid. sally came. one of the kids at the ssbb tourny last week came to ACF too. this is probably completely unjustified, but i feel like he just wants to talk to one of the girls. i wasn't sure if enoch seemed a little colder to me than usual. most of them don't really talk to me that often at all. i realized that just now. even the people i'm most apt to talk to. whenever a conversation gets rolling it starts feeling weird for me and i end up i think trying to end it. maybe i don't want to end it, but i end up ending it anyway because i stop talking. after dinner, during which i wanted to ask josé about what he remembers about barcelona because he was wearing a atl-bcn 2011 t-shirt but never did, everyone congregated in the center street activity room again. there was dance central instead of ssbb this time. i played a round of monique's card game 'amonia.' i don't really understand why half the people who play instinctively shout and point at the card every time there's a match. i pick benny benassi's 'satisfaction' when i play dance central against mike. nobody really cared about mike's dancing, but maybe i only remember people's reactions when i was dancing. they went all oohh and aahh. i kept looking at christina. i did two gangnam style dances when the game let us dance 'freestyle', one of them being the pelvic thrust. everyone laughed really hard at that, and i swear just as hard or even harder when i danced the normal one. took some more videos. migrated to the volleyball court. i played. i feel like taking off my shoes and socks is something i normally wouldn't want to do. i wanted to cool down my feet though. allison's kind of annoying still. christina noticed me. some of us got a little bit high from staying up late. i sat on a bench by myself for only a few minutes after everyone left. sam walked christina back. i think what i felt, to my Horror, as i watched them was a twinge of jealousy. i see her friend request the next morning.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday was half of this shitty weekend and nothing happened. i think the people at lucky buddha recognize me now.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i feel my judginess coming back to me. it's especially obvious when i'm watching people like monique and david. they talk to everyone the exact same way.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it's weird how i get so automatically annoyed when looking at some people but automatically friendly toward others. i mean, i find jared amusing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i think christina and one of her friends, yan, are the only two new to ACF people i've been friended with so far. i don't even try talking with anybody else. it's quite different from last year, when i Actively Tried. i remember telling kudo he had an awesome name. that was a stupid thing to say.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i've been listening to electronic music a lot. basically exclusively deadmau5. it's been either that or edward sharpe and the magnetic zeros. i like the emotionlessness of deadmau5's house (hau5). when i collect enough songs from paradoxicalsentiments i'm going to listen to all those in one go. they should tend to be softer emotional ones.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i posted &quot;mom used to tell me you die sooner if you don't talk a lot&quot; to facebook. As Expected either no one saw it or cared, and the only comment was a sarcastic one.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i passed anjaly last night and she was so nice. i guess that's why i got tongue tied, even though i didn't consider that possibility while it was happening. she wanted to get my number but her friend said it was creepy and the word 'cockblocked' popped into my head. i gave it to her today though. she still hasn't texted back.</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>NOW is a chance.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i will begin by rewinding to last thursday.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thursday was the day i saw jessie for the second time, by accident. she was sitting on a bench outside the IC, and i spotted her waiting for a friend, of hers. as soon as i began talking to her i felt it creeping up rapidly on me again, that disgusting stiffness, dullness of body and voice, that i loathe so much that only happens around people like her. i could see down her shirt. i immediately scrapped my plans to look at the organization tables lined up on tech walkway for involvement week to go eat with the two of them. the friend she was meeting is named dylan, and is the tall blonde kid i had seen her walking around the student center with several times during my second year. she saw him waiting in a line at the food court, and poked him and said hi. i knew i would have no appetite so i got an iced latte from dunkin' donuts, no sugar, because that would be easy to drink. i couldn't the find the table jessie went to, until she came out and called my name twice. it seemed awkward for her. she was wearing jeans. while the two of them ate, i didn't do a lot of talking, and sat there myself for much of the time. more loathing. i showed her the fuzzy picture i had taken of her &quot;doppelgänger.&quot; she said whoa, that does look like me, and spent most of the remaining time talking about i think her cousin, who appears to be some overly sheltered, snobby kind of kid. i said see you tomorrow in my dull voice when we parted. she texted me a few minutes later asking me about her fucking doppelgänger. i swear that's all we've talked about to each other all week, whenever we do any texting, that is.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>that day, i sat next to small, cute blonde girl in my second-to-last class and actually looked her up. her boyfriend was one of my past TAs.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on friday i finally saw a post in the ACF facebook group by jessie inquiring about parking. as expected, several people commented JESSIEEE!!! you get the drift. thoughts turned nasty inevitably, but i had no choice but to suppress them since i was just the same as they. she was already at the meeting when i made my way there. i didn't talk to her during it because i was trapped at my table with the rest of my small group members, which we &quot;built.&quot; they had a bunch of discussion questions projected, presumably solely there to kill time, and i tried taking a very slight initiative and answering some while everybody else was busy doing nothing but looking around at each other. one asked about we wanted to get from a small group, and i answered with something i always, always keep myself from gaining: lifelong friends, or as i'd put it, people with whom i'll keep in long well after i graduate, because &quot;that doesn't happen often enough&quot; (internal debate with &quot;such occurrences are rare&quot;). everyone looked at me and nodded, and as much as i'd like to think that no one really heard what i'd said, i simply can't make an assumption like that.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>david told me about weird gay things that justin le has been doing, apparently while over at david's apartment alone with him. i learned from andrew that ritchie's corolla was totaled in a hit-and-run, he told me that the driver who hit them had simply driven off. maybe they never found out who it was, in which case, PASSIVITY.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>jessie mentioned ritchie to me as the kid who keeps spamming her newsfeed, using nearly the exact same words as she did last week. she also didn't want to eat dinner with the group, because she &quot;[doesn't] like korean food,&quot; which leads me to conclude that she's not really interested in me at all even though i keep poking and prodding at her, because, and i related this to Zora as well, if she WAS interested in me, she would at least want to spend a little more time with me. but she touched my arm, twice! probably means nothing too. she left alone, without saying bye to anyone really, but not before i said to her, in an ever more dull voice, &quot;you too&quot; when she politely asked me to have a nice weekend. i watched her walk down the stairs and out of the building, by herself. now there was a sight to behold.<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
9-2, mon</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i wanted this to come out all raw. i can't say that i hate weekends anymore, because they barely feel any different from the non-weekend days now. now, all days feel equally hollow.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the non-weekend days are ever the mechanical ones, the ones where i sit back behind my eyes and watch myself go through motions, the day's motions. i've never been more automatic. sometimes i feel disgusting. how can nobody else see this, i think.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>wishlists are curses. forlorn and illusory, they'll drive you mad. i am being driven insane, i think that's what's been happening to me all last year and now this year again. i feel the cabin fever. i feel the stress pushing out at me from inside my stomach, i feel my heart boiling. is it natural to want what you can't have this much? i spend so much of my time and mental power building the most pathetic imaginary universes. no one needs to know. i have tried outputting my poison in creative, narrow streams, hoping vainly to trick somebody into drinking what i thought i could offer them. but now, they're all dry, and i just can't be bothered to let everyone know me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the bottle of blood orange italian soda now sits empty on my desk. i think i'm going to throw it away tomorrow, which is sad because it's actually not entirely empty, there's a little bit of my mother's love in there, that she added when she bought it from wherever she did (whole foods, maybe), and i could taste it even though i always paired the drink with food i barely cooked right. whenever i feel the manifestation all i want to do is curl up in bed and cry myself to sleep (the tears never come). it's why i refused to allow my brother to have a sip, because he'll still be getting all that he needs back at home. i needed it, didn't i? i need it, don't i?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i don't know whether i want more or less. desire tends to gyrate; this is called harmonic motion, and the times in which one feels most comfortable are those in which he is actually heading straight for hell. i should be able to predict this by now. but as i've mentioned to myself at some random point in the past, i'm the kind of person who doesn't like to negate prophecies.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>jennifer says she isn't really religious. i lit up at that. there's a parallel universe in which i am the antichrist.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i remember jessie asking me &quot;did you have a good day?&quot; almost pointedly, but she certainly didn't mean it that way. although this happened long ago, maybe she isn't so different from me. i would be delighted if i could know for sure that she's simply over-calculating her every move too. if we don't know what we're doing with each other. i insist in draining this basin of all hope, but maybe there's some cool, golden kind in there. i won't count on it, and i know that doing so won't make it appear.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm still thankful for Zora, and i've thrown all caution to the wind fully by now. i feel like we've entered a new phase. we rubberbanded too, just like i seem to do with all people, though for now, we're orbiting each other peacefully, as far as i can tell.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>here is a list of other people whom i've lost gravity: <span><font color="#0433FF">anjaly, patrick, tyler, <span style="color: rgb(4, 51, 255); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none;">melissa,<span> <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none;">lisa,<span> </span></span></span></span>jessie, hayson, melanie, lillian,</font></span> tom, asta, jerry, andrew, calvin, and there should be more to this but i can't include every member of ACF who is no longer physically present in this era.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i miss mike. i also miss the way sam would call &quot;daaan&quot; to me, the way i thought was stupid and annoying at the time. i should have seen this coming.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now like it or not, austin p. may actually be a second person whom i would meet in heaven.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>now i don't want this phone, and look at all of this wasted life energy exhausted, purely mentally, by imagining various universes that are all notably devoid of people. i'm scared that in the distant near future, they'll all think things like &quot;yeah, he was that kind of person&quot; where that kind is shy, secluded, lonely...? most frightening of all, they'll know definitely that i was all fear. that's when i'll regret all of the things i never did. how badly i want this to not happen to me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>because, &quot;everybody is just walking along concerned with his own problems, his own life, his own worries. and we're all expecting other people to tune into our own agenda. 'look at my worry. worry with me. step into my life. care about my problems. care about me.'&quot; i believe that this is impossible to achieve with more than one unrelated person.<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>

<hr/>
9-3, tue</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i extended my hours again today, but i think the point should be that i finish this at any point in time before i go to sleep.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>what interactions did i have today? jessie was nowhere to be found anywhere around the IC today. during my second class, wesley, one of my roommates, decided to sit down next to me and said &quot;suuup.&quot; he mistook my phone's vibrations for his. he looked rather bored the whole time and i don't think his facial expression ever changed. he never laughed at any of the professor's jokes. i don't know if the sparse and mostly silence-filled conversation that ensued after class ended is the norm for him. because he speaks in such a low voice, i lower my voice too, until it seems to match his. he's a definitive anti-role model.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>before that happened, i bumped into lisa again at the skiles walkway. she was rushed. i had nothing to say to her after she told me about how rushed she's been. the door is locked tight now. she said her life is a mess currently and i told her that i know how that feels. i'm confident that i do know how that feels. she replied that she was glad she had someone who could relate to her. pure flour. her last words were &quot;i'll see you when i see you?&quot; mine were &quot;like always.&quot; no, i don't know what i meant by that.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a square peg in a round hole.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>conversely, i now often find myself wanting to message Zora just so i can text someone during class. i will refuse to text her again until she messages me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>during my communications class, i stared at mary-ann. but i don't want to be that kind of person. i only want to get inside her head for a moment.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>during the class after that, john handed me another note card for the reading quiz. i really was going to give him back a card for the first one he borrowed for me, but since then he's given me two more and i can't help but think that maybe he's doing it to be an asshole. i don't want to think anything of it. he left without looking at or saying anything to me. i have no right to scowl because i dish out that treatment to everyone too, oftentimes probably first.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>partly because i had other homework to do and partly because i just don't want to interact with him, i told my infovis partner that i couldn't meet with him today because i had to do that homework. i made myself seem worse off in terms of where i was up to in it than i really was. i think this is called cynicism and being manipulative, but i may have to look at my lcc notes/reading. that stuff seems very interesting, actually. i believe i've deduced a lot of the material on my own.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>charlie, one of my roommates, was eating at subway too, and the eggheaded girl he's always with waved to me and i decided to walk by their table when i finished eating instead of ignoring them because charlie seems nice. of course the first thing i said to him was about the cs homework, for which he immediately offered help convincingly enough for me to then decide to sit at their table, take my computer out, and work on it right there. they ate silently with me in front of them, which made me feel like an intruder. he left soon for something, and she left right after. i still don't know her name, nor do i intend to find out what it is.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a small group email from monique. there appear to be only 5 or so other members of my &quot;small group&quot; none of whom were in the group i was part of last friday. if the group size remains small enough i may actually be able to get something, some thing out of interaction with them then. david is in there though. i applied the &quot;nitrous oxide&quot; label to the email in my inbox. after not being part of a small group for a new, this feels a little refreshing. but it does nothing to make me feel back on any sort of track.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the square peg in a round hole is what i use to describe how i feel whenever i'm talking to jessie. i just don't fit with her. i told my plan to Zora: i'll show her another picture of her &quot;doppelgänger&quot; and then tell her that i think she (jessie) is prettier. Zora said aww that's so sweet.<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
9-4, wed</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>anything interesting that happened today:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i don't really want to talk about the resume critiquing thing i went to today, although it was a confidence booster. the one thing that stood out there was this: one woman had finished a one-on-one with a student and sat after the student got up and left, she just sat at her table looking at us who were waiting. from where i was she didn't look like she was smiling so even though i noticed her i didn't get up and walk over to her. once another student did, though, and approached her, she smiled.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>dan fitzgerald sat next to me during today's 2110 lab. i can't say he's improved much in terms of social interaction. he peeked at my laptop screen as i was staring at my twitter profile page. what's your username...? he asked. dankeptpraying? i like that. i said something i've been saying to myself in my head, it's sort of a video game reference, but i don't know if he heard that. i'm glad he didn't start talking to me about religion. he didn't fully understand the concept of karnaugh maps. i finished the lab before he did.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>everybody thinks the picture of the coquerel's sifaka i use as my profile picture everywhere is zoboomafoo, to the point where i'm no longer sure if the picture i have is of zoboomafoo or of a coquerel's sifaka that isn't zoboomafoo. i think it's amazing that zoboomafoo happened to be this animal, a coquerel's sifaka. first instance of misidentification as zoboomafoo dates back to manalapan, when justin cruz said it. today, i found a steam chat message from Mizz Bubbles (i forget the steam name she used at the moment we were friended) commenting about zoboomafoo too. i'd like to note that it was sent while i was offline. from what i can see in Mizz Bubbles' profile picture, she reminds me heavily of melissa &quot;pickles&quot;. she has well over 100 hours of playtime racked up during the past two weeks. i didn't answer her. it seemed too much.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i ignored at least 3 people today: vince, helen, and heather. vince i walked past while he was sitting in front of the sixth street apartments. he had 1 out of 2 earphones in, so he could hear me as i walked by because he ignored me too. i'm not an asshole, i thought, i was just too afraid. helen i pretended not to see as i crossed the street to head to the crc. maybe she thought i was avoiding her on purpose. heather i saw at starbucks and made sure to avoid eye contact with her at all costs. i think i heard her say to her friends &quot;i'll see you guys in like an hour...&quot; what do you think they were going to do in an hour?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so i think it's sad that in those situations my first instinct is to hide. hide in plain sight. i'll just mask my attention with my computer, or phone (those are really the only 2 things to use) and project the appearance of obliviousness.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>after paying for the lifeguard class nick and andrew found me and i ate at wingnuts with them. i walked with them to just beyond the furthest away from campus in that area i have ever walked to, and it felt like a bit of the fog of war had lifted. andrew is pretty nice. after today he won't annoy me for no reason quite as much, i believe.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i should feel bad for people i see sitting by themselves. it's far too unlikely that they're worse off emotionally than i am (potentially untrue). what gets me is how sad they sometimes look, poring through study material or procrastinating, pushing their jungle closer and closer to the sea, until voilà! they turn out to be perfectly fine and capable of maintaining a 4.0 happiness average. today it happened as i saw a girl with a triple highlighter laughing at something on her phone. and even what she was reading. so there was nothing for me to worry about.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>not today:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>who is the INTA girl? she's big, i'm not kidding she has massive thighs, and can be observed in classes 4460 and 3790. i actually talked to her yesterday, but it was just to discuss a stupid logic example that involved hobbits, because my professor in that class is boring. i hope i sit next to her again. she is &quot;not on facebook.&quot;</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i have caught myself reminiscing about 1332 and the era with lisa that occurred 2 years ago. i caught on to how pathetic it was that i would still be REMINISCING about such a time in a way like that. i even looked through my homework folder. just think to yourself, would SHE be sitting in her room thinking about you and all those wonderful times you worked on the programming homeworks together? how she sat in my living room that one night, and hugged me before she left, and let me drive her acura tl? no! and as i mentioned yesterday, she's sealed the door for me.<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
9-5, thu</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i saw a lot of people today. let's count them.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in the morning i saw jesse luo, but hid from him. in class 1 i saw my homework partner, who i didn't really care for. no sign of jessie again after class 2, during which wesley sat next to me again. i swear, that kid behaves just like i do. class 3 was uneventful, save for the end when i got picked as one of 12 (twelve!) presenters for the next week or two of class or whatever, and i got paired with a girl with a strange last name who gave me the wrong email address. in class 4 i ignored my freshman year roommate but couldn't sit near the INTA girl because of where he was sitting. john dugan always seems grumpy and irritable, and consistently ignores me now. that doesn't really bother me at all, but as always the fact that that doesn't bother me is what actually does bother me. i gave him an index card today, and listened to he and rahul having some very pointless conversations.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>after that, i completely forgot about the vgdev meeting that's on thursdays, which is interesting because if i had remembered to go, then i wouldn't have bumped into anjaly drawing with sidewalk chalk at tech walkway. she gave me a hug, a nice, tight hug that actually lasted longer than half a second, and invited me to the tour of asia event (i didn't go). i then ran into steph and ritchie at burger bytes, with whom we ran into allison and christina, with whom i exchanged very few words as i ran off to finish my programming assignment. there at starbucks i found mo, and a freshman friend of hers i think her name is blaise. blaise and i didn't talk, and she just sat there while i talked with mo, although i glanced into her eyes several times during. mo had tried to text me about wolf's rain since i had reblogged her tumblr audio post of 'gravity' by maaya sakamoto. i told her that i never watched the anime, but left out the fact about my past crush on amanda x. being a reason i had discovered the song. she didn't know about tour of asia, and when i told her that there were several acf people there, and that it had just started, she decided to go. tomorrow i'm going to tell her that she has nice eyebrows, because i saw that she had reblogged a post form none other than jessie r., the one about the eyebrows.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>while working on the project with my partner, i heard him exchange rapid mandarin with several friends of his, and revealed to him that i'm able to understand the language. he got sort of excited. we finished the project okay.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>when i left i made sure to talk to anjaly again, and she gave me a tour of asia t-shirt that reminds me of her already and gave me another hug. i told her i liked her hugs...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Zora was wrong. &quot;we'll see&quot; doesn't mean yes, it doesn't mean yes at all. to me, it means &quot;i don't give a fuck about you.&quot; i haven't heard back from jessie at all, and i'm caring less and less by the day. Zora did text me today though, and it made me happy again, until she stopped answering. but we didn't have a lot to talk about.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>last night, i saw sanat sitting by the barbecue tables outside the sixth street apartments. he was just finishing a cigarette, and i watched him drop it on the floor as we were talking. i would have wryly smiled if he'd offered me one. i read off my script as he asked some questions: what did you do this summer? how's your year looking? oh cool, where'd you intern? i messed up a bro-y handshake with him. the last thing he said was that we should catch up. my ears perked at that, but i quickly calmed them down. it hasn't happened in a year, it won't ever. i don't want it to.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>for someone who loves god and all that, clement sure seems to put a lot of effort into gelling his hair.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>thinking about people having fun gets me down because it makes me aware of all the fun i'm not having. this fine sentiment comes channeled through unexpected catalysts. in this example, the substrate is six flags, and the catalyst is mary-ann ionascu. she's cute, to be sure, and it was her i thought about having fun with her friends, who are unknown shadows, maybe riding roller coasters and shit, screaming. while i, what am i doing?<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
9-6, fri</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i saw a short thing yesterday that reminded me of a short dream segment i had once. in the dream i was waiting for a car to pass before i crossed the street, but another person crossed the street before me, forcing the car to stop. then i followed suit and walked across myself. andy x. had commented on the dream note i posted online, saying that it's a sign that i don't take initiative. yesterday i took this exact initiative by crossing ferst drive while another guy on the opposite side was too scared to cross because cars were coming (but not too quickly) and he even started walking further along the sidewalk until i started walking across and then he doubled back and crossed too. idiot.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>if ACF was ever just another old boring christian congregation, it was never more so than it was today. i don't know what clement is doing at the helm, because enoch is still here. i don't know what he was talking about, but that was probably mostly because i walked in quite late and missed nearly his entire spiel on ethnicity. one tidbit that stood out to me though was about being ashamed to be part of an asian group. he mentioned people who don't like being asian and are embarrassed to gather with them, and there i identified myself. a good number of people kept their eyes open while he said the closing prayer, including clement himself. i don't get it. a considerable number of people showed up this time however.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>aside, jessie was not present today, which is 0% surprising. i told Zora but she didn't seem to care. mike also came today, and he and steph hugged each other with one arm each. i think it might be because they are technically exes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i told jennifer that she has nice eyebrows, confusing her. i then told mo that she has nice eyebrows, which she actually does, and she knew what i was talking about. she had found jessie r. through me after all.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today we went to jason's deli, which everybody always touts for having FREE ICE CREAM. i never understood why there was so much fuss for free ice cream. as soon as one person mentions it, five others begin to clamor about it, as if it was something they had all forgotten about until just then. i'm not easily excited.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i rode in a car with helen, who seems to be talking more than she usually does. not sure if she's being her genuine self or just trying hard to force-talk. either way, i shouldn't care at all, and i think i'm observing her because i think i'm better than her.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i noticed some old woman at the meeting today, who also came with us to dinner. i don't care how welcoming we're supposed to be, seeing her there was just weird. i don't know if she was expecting us to be as we were, but she slightly creeped me out. i began to have delusions of her being a government agent sent to assassinate all of us.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at dinner, i talked with monique about wolf's rain and paranoia agent, the latter of which i think melissa had told me about how many months earlier. some asian guy who was sitting across from us whose name i forget exhibited mannerisms that had me identify him as another anti-role model. i tried really hard to behave casually and lightly, and noticed that he eventually dropped out of the conversation. monique is a person who i value every second if interaction with, and i don't know why. talking with her just makes me feel special. i can't think of anyone else who i can say that about...i'll be miserable if i fall apart from her.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i said happy birthday to allison, but it turned out to not be birthday today. it's actually in 2 days, and i think i thought it was today the 6th because my birthday is 6 days after hers. it was a little embarrassing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>speaking of birthdays, mine is in 8 days, after which i turn 21. 21 is supposed to be one of those most special birthdays. in my head, it's when people take you out for shots and you come home wasted and think you had a good time that night. these words suck, but i'll probably spend it in my room alone playing left 4 dead 2, with only my parents having wished me an oh so happy birthday because i'll have stayed off the grid. pondering this is nagging at me to reactivate again.<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
9-7, sat</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>something interesting happened last night, and it was that i found myself talking to MizzB. MizzB is actually Ashley, and i don't know how or when i found her on steam but the B has something to do with bubbles and bubblegum. remember how she messaged me about zoboomafoo a few days ago? i decided to answer her yesterday and we ended up talking for a couple hours. she encouraged me to be proactive and message people i miss, and it was because of that that i messaged asta again.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the christmas lights that had been hung up in anjaly's old room are now gone.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i just unsuccessfully tried to convey to asta the guilty resentment i always feel when i think about everyone else's social circles. about yan's picture of &quot;allison's birthday cake!&quot; good job allison, it's your birthday, i imagine you'll be out celebrating with all of your buddies by eating a fancy dinner somewhere and having a Good Time. i don't need any of that, you know, i'm content with me and myself and sitting right here without anybody next to me. why doesn't anybody want to be with me? why doesn't anyone want to bake me a cake? buy me a present? spend time with me? less than a third wheel, huh?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>then i saw urvashi at atlantic station today, and was genuinely happy for a few minutes. this was a moment. she told me a little about her job and where she works now. nearby. i almost messed up a hug with her and told her that nobody from barcelona talks to me anymore, but i don't think she understood. that may have been my fault though. i didn't elaborate after all. i walked with her a short distance away from where i was standing so i could talk with her. it's good to know that she's still easy to talk to. if it had been one of the others, the words would have been as strained as usual.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i have nothing else whatsoever to say about today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>tumblr, then, is one long wishlist after wishlist, all listing ideas and idyllic images of nonexistent items and state that are 100% impossible to attain. the only path to the satisfaction you are searching to can be paved by redefining the state. realize that you can create it here and now with all that you are already holding. and all of the usual zen crap. sometimes i feel so done, and that i'm ready to lay it all out and die, but then i get rejuvenated. and cruelly so, for i am given glimpses of the full potential but never any more than the slightest of that; the rest i fill in with my mind like i do with the rabbit in the magician's hat. then they trick me into going home with a smile, i find a penny on the ground and in my euphoria take it as a sign that i'll be a millionaire tomorrow, if by tomorrow you mean the day i wake up and this smoke in my skull has miraculously cleared. for a while i'll my head will be filled with what i mistake to be purpose, but without a constant power source such an unstable current can only flow for so long. then i deactivate again, and again, and again, and remember you can only turn a device on and off so many times until it tires and out and blinks, and then you know you've got a dead battery. this battery stores my life-energy and life-energy is difficult to recharge. my task should be to discover a limitless source of life-energy, and it's probably within me or some shit like that, but i'm ready to hike into mountains, if that means i'll  discover the real thing. no, i won't do it because there's too much out there.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>taking all of my past failures with anjaly into account, maybe i should plan something out this time, clear a path to walk on, give me some smooth sea so i can set sail with her this time. prepare questions...calm your subconscious, tell him you're just going to be honest. that's nothing to be afraid of. don't hold your line back because</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday, all david and i talked about were phones. mike too. i don't know why i eagerly spat out all of that information relating to wireless carriers and service charges. i was so enthusiastic about it. !!!. like what? when did i get this excited to share such things over dinner?<br/></div>

<div>i forgot to say last time, that chris y. asked me which church i go to. just like that, he assumed that i go to one. i quietly answered that i don't know and he asked why. did i say lost interest? i only told him i had hopped around. maybe i didn't like any of the ones i've been to, he thought. but i've just lost interest. sometimes it all seems so fake to me. and i know i'm wrong there, because i only ever see everybody i know when they have their masks on. it only occurs to me occasionally that i have no idea what most of my friends look like when their masks are off. now this is something, i think, that everyone would like to know about everyone else. what they look like behind their masks. behind their smiles, behind their walks to class, behind lunchtime conversations and conversations after the meeting's over. i don't really know anybody at all, do i?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i hope our small group remains very small. i would be excited, but i've been in such a group led by monique before, and i don't know what it did for us. i'm being selfish again. if she's leading alone and there are only 6 or so people, i could actually get a say in. about my views? maybe they'll ask me to pray sooner or alter, and i'll have to say something. and like diana had written to me, it'll definitely be sincere.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'll continue to be happy if MizzB keeps messaging me. i'm at 3 for 3 now, and maybe she wants me to start first next time. who knows. as always i can't help but want to keep trying, maintaining a bond with her, but this can't be a healthy thing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>apparently asta feels the same way i do concerning friendship. perhaps she's caught in a rut too, and didn't want to talk to me for a while for the same reason i didn't really want to think about her. maybe she's moved on out of it already, since she didn't message me tonight/her morning when she said she would. i still just don't understand. i'll relay what she said to me yesterday: that she broke down crying in church because of something about identity, faith and hope. pretty sure i've heard messages on those before, have no idea what they said. she linked me to a blog she has. i'm going to read it soon. i don't think i told her straight up that i really don't care much for god anymore.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today i added 5 people to that small list of people whom i've lost.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i don't know how much these meetings of the club VGDev are going to do for me. seems somewhat hopeless. half the people who go to these meetings don't seem to have sufficient knowledge to significantly contribute to any development. i'm straying, just observing though, but i don't care about that. it's just, i sure as hell am not going to meet anyone new there. no one who will change my culture. i thought about giving up while walking there. i'm afraid i will...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i got annoyed at the pool today because someone bumped into ME while i was swimming on my right side of the lane. i think he picked up on it and reacted coldly accordingly. sorry...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>tomorrow will be another cruel exercise. another foray. i'll put on a suit and tie and extra masks as i pretend to be an extra-capable, normal guy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the parts i miss most about relationships, ongoing or lost, are their beginnings. often the times most difficult to remember, due to the hazy mists surrounding the folks who you aren't yet familiar with. every tree always looks the same at first. you get to know your way around eventually, but it feels like by the time you do, it's become deserted and barren. all the people live elsewhere now, and you just got to try to follow them.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this just in: illicitwords? who are you...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>exactly how long can you hold on to a hope? hoping for something isn't the same thing as having it, having it with you, in the moment, having it happen to you. hope is not a guarantee. you can't just cling on to hope and hold out. to run after it, you need something else. or is the hope the fuel to get you moving as well?<br/></div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>a list.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at the career fair.</div>
<div>almost instantly i spotted them. i think there were 5 of them, from barcelona. they paid a significantly low amount of attention to me. rahul wouldn't stop talking. i can see why john finds him annoying now. tomorrow he'll be talking about the apple event, i guarantee you. i waited too long to say &quot;nice to see you marie&quot; and never did, not the whole thing. i talked with lisa. i saw a freshman indian whose head looked like an alien's nod up and down constantly as he listened to a recruiter talk. i thought i looked good enough in a suit, but the whole time i thought about how entirely, mind-bogglingly stupid this whole affair is.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>you know the idea that you'll never know for sure if the people dearest to you ever loved, thought of, or cared about you in any way that you would find meaningful? i'm sure there's a small amount of that sort of thought bottled up in everybody, not even contained inside of a secure mechanism, just a little glass bottle. a little tap is all that's needed to send it on its way, but it's a very particular tap, that we go day after day somehow avoiding against impossible odds. an asteroid larger than 1 km in diameter hits our planet and wipes out humans. you die in a car crash. a cell becomes and remains cancerous. for every day that none of these things happen, you, and such madness with you, lives to see the next. i want to unscrew that bottle just the right amount so that i can take the tiniest sips. i want to know what that madness tastes like. we could all use some. everybody must have some trigger than can set it off. how do you set it off?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>our lives, each and every one of them is so fucked up. there are mobile phone operating systems called iOS and Android. a woman working at the Home Depot spends how much of her time coding something that works with bar code scanners. what does she do when she gets home? the people who have a little as possible are the ones who really have it good. if you want something you don't have, there's something you don't understand. there's something i don't understand. geometry exists. wheels spin. cars have windshield wipers. why are there mobile phone operating systems called iOS and Android? why does geometry exist? wheels just happen to spin? why do i dedicate my life to ignoring the world. because there are just never enough resources and never enough time to shift the track. there's probably not much on the next one over, anyway.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i spotted ryan c. for the first time in a couple years. we made eye contact and he immediately looked away and walked right past me without saying a word. i laughed.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today i was thinking about the woman who showed up at last week's ACF meeting. and how she might be some government spy sent to kill all of us for some reason, and began to play out the scene in my head. having gathered her intelligence, she reports back to her superiors, who send a bomber over the MoSE building, or somehow gas it and kill all of us. then, assuming i don't end up as one of the victims, i would think about everybody dying and laugh to myself, visualizing it happen to some people. i think it would be hilarious. this thought would then flit through my mind: so god came to collect his children, eh?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>small group meeting one tonight. there were 4 people. david was one of them; i like him still, to be sure, but thinking about him always somewhat sickens me now. i didn't eat any tacos with the food that monique prepared, maybe making me look like an ungrateful douche. i also just watched as she packed some into a tupperware box for me. didn't care that the box had been filled with pieces of paper we had all been passing around earlier. i was glad that we didn't do any actual bible studying today, although the book of revelations seems potentially interesting. i was also glad that mitch, allison's boyfriend, wasn't here, and that's one of the most important differences between monique and myself. she would have been thrilled to have him there, and i less than thrilled.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i hadn't heard an earnest prayer in quite a while, so while i was listening to monique pray her voice felt like cool water, i don't really like praying but hers calmed me a little bit, except for the bits where broke out of her prayer character for a moment.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i was asked again what i wanted most from this small group, and i answered that i wanted to talk to all of them after we graduate from school, and by all of them i mean pretty much only monique.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>roommate wesley is nearly disgustingly softspoken. i don't know how he has a girl over in his room all the time. why would she want to be with someone like him all of the time? i know i don't, and that may be because of the ever-present possibility that this is his only mask he chooses to present to me. i must work harder in refining my own. i will not become low again. roommate kevin (ugh), let him be a reminder, too. don't think, just say it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>during class he kept leaning over and looking at my computer screen, and once timidly, i swear timidly, said my name &quot;daniel.&quot; oh my god.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>how funny would it be if the girl who's always over with roommate daniel turns out to be his sister?<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
9-10, tue</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>one thing i have learned here at school is that things don't just happen. because it's been over 3 years since it begun, and very little has happened on its own. i'm not about to count all the things i did myself, though.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>allison brought up a funny music video yesterday at small group. it's called 'the fox' and is funny because of its nonsensical lyrics. everyone watched the video play on my phone. when it got to the part where a fox is seen in the forest, all i could think about was the &quot;chaos reigns&quot; scene from 'Antichrist.'</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>one thing i want to disagree with meggie c. r. about is that i, as a human, shouldn't be missing a half. no, i've never been kissed. i suppose this is one such hope that asta could have been describe the other day. but i will continue to work on achieving this mystery independence solo. because i should never, EVER - if one ship sinks, the other MUST remain afloat.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i play 'the end' by the doors and i'm reminded of tom r. and the vending machine way down at the end of the B wing next to the row of H lockers and the electronics classroom, and this thought springs into my head, that i wish tom had gotten me into classic rock music.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the guy who wears the hat that looks like a beret and carries that computer bag slung over his shoulder, in front of him: i think he might be rogue angel seven, even though he's not over the age of thirty.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>itching to talk to MizzB. i think it's best for me to not allow her to become a second Zora.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>allison waves only, but her ears are plugged in and sealed anyway. steph waves only as well, and to me it seems that our relationship/friendship/acquaintance is going backwards. steph, i say this because i was once too shy to address you in person, and i know now that i will not be speaking with you after this final sortie is over. my decision.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i can't say concerning anjaly that there is a &quot;once was&quot; that i wish my relationship with her could be like again. we never had anything. is this a challenge, to keep offering my company to her, taking a step but then waiting for every other after to fall into place by itself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i spoke with the INTA girl today. her name is emily j. and she is in her year 5. i sat between her and john dugan just so i could sit next to her. i'd rather sit next to her than away from john and rahul. i am reasonably certain that i am drawn to her because she remains quiet in the classes she shares with me, 2 of them, aloof. buried within herself. she makes it look good. i peeked at her messages. she has an iphone and an ipad and uses a stylus on the ipad to write notes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>looks like the girl mary-ann regularly exchanges words with people, because she blabbered to me a couple times today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>here, i'll talk about rahul for a bit: we encountered each other in the student center after both of us had just gotten food. i claimed an empty table and he decided to eat with me. i would have been perfectly fine had he elected not to like any normal person would. i wished he had, in fact. i felt like much more of a loser eating with him than i do when i'm eating alone (thank you very much allison). this moment ranks very high on my list of empty surface interactions; it was incredible, how we had absolutely nothing to talk about. i was so desperate that i brought up the apple keynote, which made for as shitty a conversation as ever. i said that i usually walk back to my room rather than take the bus, and his first response was &quot;even in this heat?&quot; the reaction astonished me, and what i wanted to say was a very basic what do you mean, in this heat? but i didn't even say that, i just pointed out that we're not wearing suits. what sort of head has he got, that he assumed some heat would drive all people on campus to strictly take buses, no walking allowed.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i never took it upon me to answer my RA's email. the last one was sent out to so many residents. i hope most of them answered and that i'm the only one who ignored her. it would make her life easier, i think. makes me sick. out of the blue, i sent elizabeth d. a friendship request. please remember me, it says. if just my name. if just for the time being.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i can't believe i thought about jordan c. before myself (concerning the question of animals vs. human language).<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>

9-11, wed</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i came up with a six-word story and it goes like this. She had experienced death 37 times. &quot;She&quot; because I'm a male. &quot;had&quot; because it's ongoing. &quot;death&quot; because i want to learn to embrace such a thing and not be afraid of it. &quot;37 times&quot; because i don't know what dying is like. she too was kidnapped by aliens, similar to the tralfamadorans, and instead of putting her in a zoo they put her through existence experiments to test the human element of existence.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today, sam e. and i had nothing to talk about. i was happy to see him, but it ended up as anticlimactic as usual. i'm not saying anything more about the career fair. except that i saw my infovis partner there. i think i always get taken slightly aback when i see him because i don't really want to have anything to do with him, but he always actually stops and says something to me. am i just really closed off, or have i come to expect others to not pay any attention to me, to the point where as little attention as this is a surprise?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a few days ago i found stacks of this small book called 'Erato' in the student center. it must be some student publication, and is filled with poems and writings and artwork. this could be good for me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so i have been chatting with asta quite a bit some, lately, and she told me that she believes our friendship is pretty enduring. i think i can agree with her. she isn't lost, after all...her life seems to suck, and i wonder what she thinks about  it that could be different from all others who have become fused to the system. i thought i had it bad this summer, but my summer is better than her Life now, and that has got to feel sucky. i'd like to be a Directional Light for her. she doesn't seem to have very many others to talk to, and when she mentions them i still get jealous. i suppose jealousy is still better than apathy. any emotion does defeat apathy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>hi elizabeth d.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i have not yet been able to pinpoint why talking with david always pisses me off slightly, always just enough to make me a tiny bit sour inside. something in this piece captures it: he said something about women not being able to get buff because they don't have enough testosterone. this is not the correct question to ask, but why, fucking why the fuck would you say something like that?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today is alex l.'s birthday, and it is a reminder of those days long past spent with him and the rest in that group, at his house. thanksgivings, new years, christmases, the works. all flushed, together in the clump with the rest of the years.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>erst wenn die wolken schlafen gehen</div>
<div>kann mans um am himmel sein</div>
<div>wir haben angst und sind allein</div>
<div>gott weiss ich will kein engel sein</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i decided to google &quot;for twenty year olds who have never been loved&quot; but i confused a couple of the terms, and so i clicked on a search result that led to a forum in which a 22 year old girl posted, two years ago, a lament at her never having been kissed by a guy yet. some replies. you'll find what you're looking for as soon as you stop looking, the lesson typically is, and that may be hope kind of backwards. perhaps having no goals does make one happier after all. what happens when you stop looking for things? maybe you're only able to do that when you realize either you already have what you were looking for, or that you know where it is somehow, its location having slammed its way into your mind like a meteor. either way, the waves calm after that. your sea's surface becomes mirror smooth and you can finally see yourself as you were meant to be, whatever that is.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it takes a unique mood for me to go on a nice, fulfulling rammstein listening spree, and oddly it's usually one that contains a dash of that word again - hope.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the world is far too big for me to try to fit into a pepper jar. if i could i would store all of my memories in such jars, and flavor it uniquely, maybe with some peach, and pass them away for all to taste. they'll say &quot;this was so and so, and he lived a pretty how life.&quot;<br/></div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>monique didn't exactly give me a straight answer when i asked if i could go to six flags with her, but that's because she's is going with a huge group (of 8 people). she and eric lee are the only 2 of the 8 who aren't dating anybody. that's the first thing i paid attention to. next, i could hardly be interested any less in most of the people she mentioned...except for jenny oh, the cause of whose abrupt disappearance from after her very brief appearance in my life remains unknown to me. we had explored the CULC in the beginning of my year 2, just after the building opened, and i had said that the stairs resemble hogwarts. the building was new and the rest of the school was still new to me as well. we sat at one of the white board tables and she drew a stick figure of me and herself and lovingly captioned it &quot;jen and dan at the culc!&quot; i took a picture of it and uploaded it to facebook. she later deleted all of her comments on it. before i discovered that, i noticed her text messages sent to me taking on a considerably harsh tone. why DID she go from me? we had hung out once near the crc also, and she invited me back to her north avenue apartment and made a bowl of noodles for me. having been who i was 2 years ago, i know what i must have acted like.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>david has agreed to take me to a bar. since he's having a &quot;picnic&quot; on &quot;saturday night&quot; i'll be less than surprised if he decides to bail. i'm not ready to expect any more than the two of us, although that'll still feel strange. i don't know what's going to happen.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>asta has mentioned that she gets antisocial around her birthday too, with her best friend. there should be a term for this emotion. i have long since realized the reason this once critical-to-happiness-survival time of year becomes no more than mundane over each iteration. and that it's nothing to mope over, because to most people at least, this type of thing just happens.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i couldn't sit next to the INTA girl today because freshman roommate sarthak was sitting right next to her. fuck you sarthak. why would YOU sit right next to her? because it certainly can't be for the same reasons i want to! i took this opportunity to sit back a few rows, blissfully away from john and rahul as well.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>friday is TOMORROW. the six flags night is just a bubble, and was a small deal for me last year and this year also. but it's going to pass tomorrow no matter how much i think about it and all that's passing with it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>ethan had noticed that i disappeared from cs 2200 last year, and all csukas could say to me was &quot;this guy.&quot; he repeated those two words at least 3 times. so i admitted to ethan that i had dropped the class, and that i suck basically. then they may have watched me disappear. head down low, tucked away, looking away.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a nice black guy helping some guy with frustrating physics-related homework last night. they prayed. but all i caught was the end &quot;in jesus' name i pray. amen&quot; why did i only catch those last few words.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'd rather not talk about kevin l. but i can't help noting that i saw him last weekend and that my feelings towards him are lethal.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i am quite certain that i want to attend tomorrow's ACF meeting on ethnicity: part TWO just so i will be able to write about it, and the writings about it will constitute the usual talked with who or not and about what for how many seconds and what did she say and what did i say.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today, yan was spotted, by me, throwing away a popsicle wrapper as she proceeded to walk and eat alone. i seem to see yan often on her own. she seems like she's behind a veil. her face is obscured just a tiny bit, like there's a thin sheet of silk in front of it. i don't dwell on yan specifically for very long, but this is why i simultaneously love and hate drama and romance movies; why waste so much time on this tiny unimportant slice of universe when there's so much else out there; why bother trying to drink the universe when there's everything you need to know on this slice alone?<br/></div>

<div>it's funny how the only people on this earth who are 100% satisfied with themselves, and everything the world has to offer, had to give up everything they had first. excess is the antithesis of secrecy. i know, i know, we all want more. shedding weight is simultaneously enormously difficult yet exceeding easy. it requires no force but takes so much effort. every time you get in a car by yourself and drive off, you're making this planet a little less bearable for the rest of us. what do the monks in tibet do?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the big paradoxes of our age. i want to be myself, but don't know how to begin something this simple. one step i can take is to refrain from editing what i have already made. if i want it to change, i'll have to start with a brand new model. a bit is the smallest quantity of data a digital computer can store. today, i am being deleted one bit at a time. every time i log on, a bit is gone. every post i scroll past is another bit gone. i add interests. i edit. every emotion i suffer because of these are new poison bits that get written into me, and this data is nigh impossible to discard.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>aside from friends and money, this year is currently lacking a soundtrack as well. come on people, i don't maroon 5's 'love somebody' to be the only song on this sortie's score. i have a host of shiny, unlistened to albums waiting to be imprinted upon.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i wanted my new phone number so people would stop bothering me. bothering me not by bombarding me themselves with messages, calls, and invitations, whatever seems to be the norm, you silly goose, but by not doing so when they can. see, my ???????? acts as a mirror in these situations. now, if anybody tries to text me, that text will bounce off and it will never find its way to be without guidance.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>what i'm afraid anjaly thinks of me: i'm afraid that she thinks of me the same way i think of her. a could-have-been. maybe i'm already past that stage in her mind. she's just too nice to say so. i've thought more than once about touching her arm, but i don't think dogs actually know what to do if they catch up to a car they were chasing, or their own tails (do dogs even do that anymore?). i'm just a dog, and anjaly, and people just like her, are moving at light speed. i petted no dogs today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>we do not have enough resources for MizzB.</div>

<div>my lcc partner, torie, claims to be a people watcher. her slow speaking mannerisms are similar to helen's. not dishonest, but unable to tell a whole truth. during the class transitions at the CULC, she stared at the people for at least 10 minutes while i read. she claimed to find it interesting, and even said sorry if i find it boring. um, buddy? are you trying to do something? not the question for me to ask, but man, you seemed fake there.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>tonight was the school's six flags night, an annual night in which buses ferry kids to the amusement park and they run around and come back. six flags night is like the last night of the world. i wouldn't notice either one. well that's my goal. i don't want there to be any difference between six flags night and the last night of the world.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm working on lower my inhibition gates further, and will attempt to continue pseudorandom contact with monique, this attempt has thus far been fruitless.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i do an awful lot of remembering these days. just reading from the old scripts, out with the new, in with the old, nothing new, all old. i need some fresh fruit in this fridge.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>six years ago, i was married to the first girl i'd fallen in love with. one high school classmate reminded a few people of it one day. he was then in a relationship with a girl and i did not know it was serious. there is nothing to be taken from this story.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i kind of like what i just messaged asta. here is what i told her: i'm afraid to use swear words [on facebook] because the ACF people won't like it. once, one of the leaders (enoch) took me into a room and gave me a pep talk about i was not fit to be a leader after i posted &quot;choo choo motherfucker.&quot; i proceeded to become an asshole for the rest of the year, and he was right about me.<br/></div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>today is my birthday.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the domino's delivery people are awfully nice. they call me by name, and ask if i ordered a pizza from them. the guy yesterday asked me things like how am i doing tonight? wished me a good weekend. i thought, maybe he's lonely. maybe he's as lonely as i am, only with less hope because he's already as old as he is and his job is to deliver pizzas to people. is he just sad? is that why he was nice to me? thinking about him led to thinking about people in that way that makes me start to cry. i decided then that that's one of my favorite emotions, thinking about people and their feelings until it makes me start to cry too.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today, 29 people wished me a happy birthday on facebook. 4 people wished me a happy birthday outside of facebook. we see you, dan. we love you, dan. we care that you are there, dan. in the past, that was all that i could hear when i read what people wrote to me online. today, for the first time, i did not hear those whispers in my ear as i read my birthday posts. i'm kind of proud. i'm going to ignore most of them, because i ignore most other people's birthdays.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this is just a thought, but i today i also recalled the first time i asked jessie for a hug. i changed my mind and am not going to talk about it now. it's not worth the time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the briefest burst of moment in which you're able to truly see that your life IS perfect, like glimpsing a lightning bug or bolt. then it's washed away, gone. it's rather hard to view it again, the way you can replay a video or movie to watch a particular detail over and over again, to have it re-etched into your short-term memory for only a few seconds at time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>who else's birthday is today? there are thousands of students at this school, many of whom know of the birthday problem. i thought of this while walking across a silent campus. things are going on, but i can't hear them. i have no evidence of them, and thus to me they are not occurring. but yet at the same time i know that they are. it's like the apocalypse again.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>true to my word, i went shopping soon after i woke up today. monique, true to her word, did nothing to throw a surprise party for me. this observation does not contain any bitter flavor. it is merely an observation, nothing more.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i was reminded last week during the graduation meeting of the things i had felt throughout my senior year of high school. sunset, light at the end of the tunnel, closing, those sorts of feelings, only there was less unity to be felt in that howey lecture hall. we are all graduating on time, we are all part of the same school, but we had nothing in common with one another.</div>

<div>as i walked past the wine aisle in target, the thought occurred to me that i could buy a bottle. no intention to, though...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>elizabeth deaver was with rachel hutto. now that i know about the six degrees of separation, this is no longer coincidence to me, but it makes me jealous. jealousy arising from another reminder of how much greater than six degrees my separation from her is (both of them, in fact).</div>

<div>i'm sitting by a girl who has the kind of face that would make a photograph. she has the eyes, and the lips, and the cheeks. she had on a blue [outer garment], a simple magenta dress, and a magenta and orange silk scarf. hair tied up in a bun. light freckles dotting her cheeks. the kind of deep face...the kind you gaze into and see the ocean in, the stars, the universe. i glanced and stared at her face many times, and realized that it was one of the falling into love moments. &quot;falling in love&quot; with everybody you see, huh? she was one of them. i made a contact high five with her, with my elbow. i thought about jessie r. they should be similar people.</div>

<div>one day, kelly h. bought me a chai tea latte at starbucks, and we talked about god and shit at a table. the next day, i bought myself another chai tea latte even though i didn't like the taste one bit.<br/></div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>today i'll be speaking about how david took me to a bar for my birthday. first i'm reiterating a few things from yesterday.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>of the 29 people who posted a birthday post to me, i answered i think 6 of them, and 1 has replied to my answer. that person is diana, who i in turn did not answer.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i wonder if all other people feel this same sort of love around their time of year. do they look forward to this shower, this sprinkling, of love and affection? on my 21st turn, i could hear for the first time. i could hear the silence through the rain that proved what all of these posts really say. we see you, dan. we love you, we care that you are there, dan. i always wanted to store all of that up, in my own little bottle, to get drunk off of whenever i could. any insane person would tell you that it's empty, and for years i thought this was like a fountain of youth thing. this time, i saw through it all, and now that i've achieved this, i suppose, i can finally turn my birthday off.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the bar david took me to is called ormsby's, and i initially felt a little guilty because i wasn't sure if he really wanted to go there with me. the guy who was checking the IDs said happy birthday to me. i felt a lot of familiar feelings as soon as i walked inside, both good, and bad, the good relating to barcelona, the bad relating to me. they had no mojitos. it was really loud. i didn't like the noise. david paid for my first drink, which was a rum/coke. i asked for the rum and coke. it tasted like a rum and coke. it tasted like barcelona. as usual i paid attention to how my face was feeling, and by the end of the first drink i felt fine. david and i just talked about our phones again. i don't know why the conversations between us always center on smartphones. because i don't know a lot of cocktails, i bought myself a long island iced tea that david kept encouraging me to get, knowing that i would be drunk by the end of it. i knew it would happen quickly. i hadn't wished to become very intoxicated, but to hell with that. david spotted someone, charlotte. i knew who she is. sam knows her. she's the girl with the mole just above her upper lip. i had never spoken to her before. she was in my psychology class last spring. her friend with her, teresa, also looked familiar. even after sailing well beyond the shores of drunk i still remained mostly quiet while they all chatted and charlotte wrote her name on a board to play bocce ball. i had played a game similar to it, but couldn't remember what it was until just a moment ago before beginning to type this sentence: it was at the emerge retreat nearly two years ago.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>random access memory: sitting outside on some stairs by the side of the street, smoking cigars that sanat had bought. i don't know who else i was with. we were with a group of strangers, sitting with and talking to them. i remember holding a girl's hand for a while. i was severely drunk though, and may not have realized that she didn't want me holding her hand. her boyfriend, well she introduced him as that, appeared and i think he pulled us apart, but i just dropped my grip and we left. because i was as drunk as i was, this feels ever so dreamy.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>random access memory: during some bullshit quiet time we were given at that emerge retreat to go over some bible verse or questions or whatever, i followed steph around as she walked with her friend. i still liked her at the time, and looking at her made my heart hurt.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>david had invited me over to his apartment too, which is very close by apparently, but having finished that long island and disliking the bloody mary i drunkenly decided to take on, i just wanted to go home. so we left charlotte and teresa and drove to mcdonald's. my mind was very hazy. all this while, david told me about the other ACF people and all the times they drank. he told me monique likes to drink. i don't know why she likes to drink, but that goes against my previous impression of her. he also told me that he and steph had taken a break for a little while, a month or so? and that during that time, diana wanted him to date her, and because he didn't want to, they no longer have a solid friendship. i forgot to ask how this affects his relationship with christina. this came as a surprise. i suppose diana had none of this in mind when she posted her birthday message on my wall, that included &quot;What's cooking bro?&quot; think about this for a second, the differences between her states of mind and being when she typed and clicked that stupid little message to me, and when (and i'm imagining here) she was arguing with david about these deep matters. the nature of it all makes me feel even more reduced to an even smaller pebble on the ground.<br/></div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>from now on each day should be its own experience. but until i wake up in the morning,</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday i had a rare stranger encounter at the fitten bus stop. in my book, it did not go well, what with all i had in mind about how successful jessie r.'s stranger interactions have been, whenever i read about one that she's written about. the guy was almost certainly a freshman (i don't remember 100%) but he wore jeans and a plain shirt that i'm pretty sure was tucked into them. had a somewhat hunched back and was on his phone. it was one of those samsung galaxy phones. i heard him say something, make a noise, at me, and i turned to face him and he had a very low, baritone voice. one of the infamous unused voices, i thought. it immediately made me aware of how underpowered, again, my own vocals were being. at least his seemed to have some character embodied in it. he asked me beginner questions like am i waiting for the grocery bus, what is my major, that immediately tipped me off to his being new here. i think i had the same kind of hope when i first arrived at this school, that everyone i met could be my friend. he said he's egyptian. unfortunately, he reminded me heavily of dan fitz., and i cite that as the main reason i shied away from him. not that i likely wouldn't have otherwise, but i'm sticking to that reason. particularly when the bus's loud air conditioning came on suddenly just as i was about to say something. he laughed an almost unnatural laugh at that. kept asking me these life questions, like what i would have differently at school (after telling him i'm a senior) if i had such a chance, in i swear the exact same manner that dan fitz. had with me back in barcelona. he asked me what i do in my spare time, and i still wasn't able to give him an answer. the best i could do was say L4D2, and that's almost worst than no answer because i don't want it to be a truth. he said that he wanted to simply take a walk around atlantic station. i thought, i've been there. i didn't stick around to see how successful his walk was. i was glad that i got back onto the bus well before he finished his untold journey, but not because i didn't like him in any way. i was just scared again. a missed stranger opportunity. i ran away.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i have changed the visibility of the facebook notes i had posted last year, the ones detailing the days of my vacation trips during the two weeks off from school last summer in spain. i've changed the visiblity to Only Me, because these memories have always been visible solely to me. only i remember sitting under the big tent, under the rain, drinking the beer i hated so much, asking sean g. when his worst birthday was. i can't share these if i wanted to. asta's message came to me a little too late, and it was something i took too long to realize myself. i'm forever unknown again, and will remain so, buried under my privacy, a victim of myself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i saw a possibility branch grow, while my bird of thought temporarily perched on david's branch. it chirped that maybe david wanted me to share the bottle of wine at his apartment with him for the same reason i had hoped lisa would come over to my apartment one year ago, to share a bottle of some liquor that patrick had bought for me. and the same reason i retried this on anjaly.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the only other notable word exchange of the day occurred between me and the jessica from my lcc class. her voice is higher than i thought it would be. we had one of the lightest surface interactions i have ever experienced recently. i would rate a lot of my talk with people to be high up on that scale, but she tipped it enormously somehow; perhaps it was the subject matter to discuss, maybe it was all just too standard, but i tasted a bitter acid despite the fact that she was nice. just nice. didn't offer a lot of help with what i was doing, but you can't blame HER for that.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>tomorrow will see a rush unlike any other since the bygone days of graphics-with-sam.<br/></div>

<div>in a cruel twist of irony, i am back in a very humble position as coder. i swallow the humility and try not to taste it, hope nobody around can see it. and nobody can see it, but i feel it fully. back to the old days, the old ways, dark alleys i swore i wouldn't visit again. in short, i had no plan for this assignment and, just as expected, none appeared on the horizon to save me. the only person who can is the one i swore at in disgust and promised myself to never rely on. irony indeed. my life depends on him now. this is karma.</div>

<div>i spotted a camera in action today it was assisting its user in administering the drug for him, as he snapped a photo of a line too long what could he have in mind but to inject it into his binary blood and get high? he's going for it, i thought, he's going to give it to his friends and wait for the effects.</div>

<div>at any given moment, tens of thousands of neutrinos pass through your body; there are probably just as many opportunities to talk to somebody you know at the same moment, but like the neutrino, you interact with nothing. on a typical night, several of you will remain motionless for hours, hovering right next to each other no more than 100 feet away. there is so much time, but we need it to sleep instead, the most valuable time for the most valuable time. a shame, almost. then after the sun rises, you get up but there's a part of your mind that seems to remain asleep, and has been in this hibernation stupor for years. this is just one reason why so many days, as well as nights, are spent sleeping. we drift closer to each other than any of the ten thousand neutrinos come to your closest cell, and even though we're so much more massive, nothing happens. this can't possibly happen by chance, unlike the neutrino, you see, we choose to swerve away at the last moment.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>monitoring all self actions closely during the presentation...on experience! failures: did not aid poor little torie when she needed it. she's indeed like helen, just physically smaller, likely very bright and VIVID internals, tropical person within, that's kept hidden. successes: people were amazed at the photorealistic shower paintings, and snickered at the portal 2 intro vid. professor with a hushed emphatic &quot;yes!&quot; upon my revealing the paintings. she had to come to the rescue more than i actually did. no follow-up with torie, or jessica. we're done here.</div>

<div>sarthak, what exactly the fuck are you doing sitting next to my INTA girl? you have no business with her. what are you trying? back off. lol.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>anjaly, and disappointment. i'm deeply sorry. i feel ridiculous, helpless, like i'm drowning and desperately trying to cling on to her, for a little more life. begging her to take me, glad that my body is hidden under the water, which unbeknownst to me is crystal clear (only i cannot see through it). you're a very, very unique drug to me, you know that? can i get a little more of you? no, i don't let myself put the needle in.</div>

<div>today i had a second chance encounter with the egyptian dude. i greeted him casually. he had a test. in psychology. i didn't care. i don't want to run into him too many times again.</div>

<div>something unfolded tonight that was kind of like what happened with harry/ron and hermione after they beat the troll in book one. i haven't fucked up a computing project this badly since the bygone days of graphics with sam, and tonight everything went embarrassingly as one would expect. what would you expect, with no sort of backup plan at all.  partly because i was slightly high from being tired, we started laughing and cracking up at how generally miserable this homework turned out to be. fuck jim foley. we almost started, i would use the word, bonding. well the terms of an experience that i now know, this experience will not be permitted to complete. we will no longer be partners and will never communicate with each other again.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>christine p. and lisa x. were at starbucks. today i glimpsed lisa from the angle of a Whole Girl. they steered the conversation towards christine's boyfriend, huy. now huy and i are by no means friends, and again the two of them get under me with the things they assume, however correctly, i know. lisa had talked about her boyfriend to me long before any introduction. now christine too. i also have to remember that they're probably not as happy to see me as they seem. what am i to them, anyway? i am nothing more than a slight hiccup in their trains of thought, which they immediately resume running right in front of me, after initially noticing me. they asked me about my birthday, which was surprising that they remembered (lisa, at least), and asked me if i got drunk at the bar, Ormsby's. they knew about Ormsby's. and just like that, again, a culture which is so fresh and novel to me turns out to be famous. downplayed. belittled. it's this, the peculiar feeling of feeling perpetually late. late to the party, late to life. always late. too late.</div>

9-18, wed</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this morning i passed by another one of the people i have come to know of through jonathan p. this one's name is tony, and i've brushed past him several times in the past couple weeks, and in each one of them, he's given me a loud, emphatic &quot;hey!&quot; he's also been wearing headphones. i apply my own patterns to his behavior, and conclude that he too is trying to break out of the silence bonds, cut a little bit of the rope each time, learning to be freer. i may be totally wrong, and actually hope i am (this is being self-centered). i don't care about him at all.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(rapidly) increasingly, i am becoming hyperconvinced that every single thing i don't have, that corresponds to something i do have, is magically better than what i do have. this hardening rule so far applies mostly to material. the blurred picture is somehow more appealing than any microscopically pixel-perfect art, and is certainly better, greater than, any art that actually has a ground in my reality. this has to stop. it is causing me an unparalleled amount of stress. the medium isn't even a would-have, a could-have, a should-have, a what-if (there are actually fewer of those). it's just some purple and pink fantasy arena in which i'm trying to construct my life 2, wherein all of the universe conditions are tantamount to those of an insane asylum. because i am insane when i travel there, and then nothing seems to be wrong at all. but i know at this point that mind can be trained, and i will need to reforge another cortex or two.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this afternoon i passed by pat n., freshman roommate. he recognized me. he gave me a sort of nod. i flashed my smile-of-recognition. i wondered how many times he's had sex.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this afternoon i passed by lisa, less than a minute after i passed by pat n. she was walking briskly because she and a friend were going to see which way to class is faster. ok. good-bye. god, i fucking swear, sometimes that girl is just so stupid.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this evening i passed by jennifer l.; anjaly's roommate (clarification). she decided to walk with me to the crc, where i was going to swim 30 laps in the competition pool. it would seem that she's trying to get herself into an exercise routine, but the initial impediment that's always present in that thing has been blocking her. i'm not sure why she decided to walk with me, but it made me think of this: i have already looked her up on facebook once, quite a while ago (so i know what her last name is). neither of us have friended each other. i now think about what sorts of thoughts would flit through her head if i asked her to be facebook friends with me. i don't want to list out anything embarrassing. perhaps this can be made into a test, but it wouldn't be vital enough to hold. i guess we're just acquaintances. never more, never less...the essence that this snippet is aiming to capture is that of potential, lost. i got it!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>[on monday], i'm going to tell monique about a high for the week. if the small group does not include a highs and lows session as past iterations have, then i'll try to wait for an opening. i'll say that a good thing that's been happening to me recently is that i've been running into a lot more people who i know. and that's good, but i don't know why; maybe it's because i'm in my room for less time than i was last year, although that alone cannot be enough, but anyway, there's a sad side to it too. the sad side is that when this era ends, all of this increase in traffic will not impact my life at all, and the congested streets are as good as empty. because this isn't a city, it's just a lonely back road that the occasional person will just happen to find himself in, a road that is only taken when he is on his way somewhere. people don't stop when they're on their ways. that's not when the good pauses take place, i think.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this is what i don't want to happen to anjaly, and i believe i will make this a goal for me, a goal! do not allow anjaly to drive to the end of this road. save her, tow her back, salvage her. a person like her is reinvigorating, i don't want to be a sieve any longer.<br/></div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>i don't remember what the news story was about. i just know that it made life seem redundant, again. when you look at it from high enough above. zoom out enough. a person, walking through the city streets, hears this and thinks nothing of it. tomorrow, the same thing, and the days after that</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this is concerning the asian girl in my lcc class, whose name i don't know. i saw her talking with someone today, and i was shaken (just a little). i was reminded that all of the people there have lives outside of that room, that the room is not the ordinary for them. it's the ordinary for me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>meanwhile, the girl with the samsung series-9 (i know the model name of her computer) who sits in front of me in another room has a boyfriend. i know because i heard her mention it. i'm not going to make any further remarks, other than that time is running out.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>jesus christ never graduated from college. now as soon as i heard that, i looked straight towards dan fitz. to see his reaction, and even he laughed, heartily too. this should emphasize even more now how little i knew the years back, when i was afraid to read 'siddartha' by hermann hesse because i thought it would make god angry or something. how foolish, stupid.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>bill gates never graduated from college either, and i heard roommate wesley's shitty attempt at a lighthearted joke (?) &quot;better drop out right now.&quot; any definite judgement from me will only result in bad karma for me, i know it, but that guy seems so weak to me, i can't get over it, i just want to step into taller shoes so i can look down upon him from higher and higher. he's like fat jeff from work. everything about him that reflects me disgusts me. i'm disgusted by my own reflection. how's that for introspection?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>jessica c. from lcc borrowed my pencil in class today, and there's absolutely nothing noteworthy about this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i happily opened a door for mary-ann i., but she didn't say thank you.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i asked the professor a question about a test question, and felt slightly proud of myself. her answer actually helped me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>goddamn it Zora, if i hear another word about seven. i really don't care if he breaks up with her, because she'll get over it (right?) and maybe then she'd finally stop talking about him, worrying to death whenever he doesn't contact her for more than a day. i'm glad we're still in touch, but most of the time we just talk about stupid shit. she's not so sophisticated after all. her parents don't know she's in a long-distance relationship with a 33/34-year-old who apparently still lives with his mother. i sort of want to tell V this, but i'll wait.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it has now been 3 weeks since jessie and i last communicated. what does this mean? it means that she has only come out to ACF for 1 out of 4 or 5 weeks, it means that she still has the tv she said i could simply take from her because they don't need it anymore and it's just sitting there. it means that i've deleted the pictures of her lookalike that i was showing to show her, that i was actually going to show her. it means that i'm going to go against a promise and not remind her that we still need any sort of catching-upping.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>asta and i are &quot;still talking.&quot;</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i should ask anjaly this. i will ask what she thinks of all of this ridiculous planning. we're tossing hour-long intervals from our schedules out at each other. as if this is all that our interaction is meant to be. for crying out loud, we're five fucking weeks into school and we're scheduling a meet-up midway through the sixth...this is taking on the essence of an ordinary class meeting, maybe even an interview, and that's a very sour, bitter taste to include. please, i don't want you tasting like that in my head. if this is all i'm going to get, then i may very well drop it soon, once and for all. how is this so difficult? this should not be so difficult.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>music is my time machine.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and as the night owl takes flight again, time flies short and the apocalypse is near. how does that make you feel? lazy? compare and contrast your emotions as they are with what they would be if you knew you had one week left to live.<br/></div>

9-20, fri</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>let me refresh my memory, how did this strand of thought go again? oh, that's right, i had thought something about friendship bonds constantly being in a state of flux. there are scientific ways of going about this, there are mathematical functions that can precisely predict the magical quantity that currently represents your relationship with friend x, but even god doesn't know what they are. the people at facebook have tried. they can graph and formulate all they like, draw all the lines between friends, these soulless quantum entities that their engineers call friends, but they'll never get it right. friends cannot be quantized. they can buzz all around you like a swarm one day, and be miles away from you the next day.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>death is certainly a change. yesterday i read about how to deal with the change that is death, and i felt guilty because of all the changes i fear i will eventually go through, death has not been one of them. i shouldn't allow to be afraid of anything until i'm ready to die. usually, death isn't really anything to worry about. not because it it's going to come for you later rather than sooner, but because it's going to come at all. that's a very good thing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>well today i was forced to look at my own two feet when kyle k. walked into the TA demo room while i was waiting to demo my homework. we never looked at each other. the other people in there talked about computer-related things. i was worried that my breath smelled bad while i was talking to the TA, and waited for a painfully long time before admitting that i pulled my full adder schematic from the internet. every time i see kyle k., i'm reminded of what i've lost. that's the purpose he serves in my life. to remind me of (just this one particular thing, mind you) this that i've done to myself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i met jonathan p. by the sixth street apartments while on my way to the pool. because i was stopped by them, i could only watch monique, vince, and an unidentified third person leave the fitten bus stop to walk to ACF. that's the odd result of all of the advertising they do on the weekly emails about gathering and walking to ACF together. three people, who could have just gone together anyway. ladies and gentlemen, the fruits of their labor.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>anyway, i had to try to not glance at michelle as she walked by in her swimsuit. bikini, more like, actually. i only feel comfortable admitting out loud that she has a nice butt. yep, that's all i can say about her, about her, about her. that's certainly changed the way i view her now.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today i sort of thought about lying to Zora. it's not a big deal; i'm quite sure i've already lied to her several times, but this time i just happened to think about these little white lies and how easy they are to construct. how simple to create a false image for yourself! become a fake person? well a little bit faker than you were just a minute ago!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>as a result of meeting jonathan p., i missed an ACF meeting by accident for the first time. that i can recall, and also not entirely; i knew i was going to be at least an hour late, assuming they start at 6:30 even though they tell everything to meet and walk at 6. by 7:44, allison, nick, andrew, and a girl who looks like asta were heading down the path i take to class every day, meaning they finished the meeting in an hour or less? andrew keeps surprising me always with his genuine displays of decency. he let me borrow his phone to call chris to ask if there were any open rides remaining. mike answered my phone call even though he didn't know about my new phone number (his sure surprise could make for an entire story of itself). but i couldn't take him up on his offer to, after already reaching there, drive back here just to pick me up. the thought alone made me feel miserable. i took a trip to that cheap chinese place that will not be named, and came back only to be seen by allison and her fucking friend again, and be caught returning from a cheap-chinese-restaurant-that-will-not-be-named run for the first time. on the way there, i think i saw jenny o. if it was her, she may have seen me too, and i looked downward in terror as her head twisted slightly.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>on the stairs, was sheridan. i said a hey, she said a hey back. there are thousands of unseen stars and untold stories all hidden within those two beys.<br/></div>

<div>saturday is loser day. it is the emptiest of all days of the week. this year, some of the roommates stay in their rooms too. while it's nice to know that i'm not the only one here, i also liked it better when there was no one else here.</div>

<div>everyone has a demon core.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>it's an interesting phenomenon, when you choose to hate somebody on no grounds. i'm sure everyone has a had a chance to experience this virus, directed at one or more peers. i thought i would be immune by now, but evidently not. i want to cough and vomit every time i lay eyes on a certain one or a few people. what i haven't had a chance to observe, though, is the process by which the symptoms disappear. how do they go away? it feels good when it gets cured. every time this cloud gets lifted up from in front of someone i've chosen to block, a wasp in my stomach becomes a butterfly and a puppy is born. then, sometimes it begins to emanate from somewhere within me again, attacking someone whom i thought it had let go of. i have no idea how many times i've been the target of someone else's disease. after over a year or so of suffering from my own, i am pleased to announce that &quot;mandrew&quot; is now free from my demon core. maybe this is how God supposedly feels when a soul is &quot;saved.&quot; but i am not a god, so i don't know.</div>

<div>at this point in time her presence is not projected to progress any further beyond gray shadow. she has entered my life, and will leave it through, a crack under my door. up on her room's door is a board upon which is scrawled something about a coffee night. this is not analogous to anything david c. has ever done. i mark my calendar to remind me to go, and title the event &quot;her coffee night :)&quot; with a smile. this is a warning sign. the smiley is another example of what i will call a Directional Light; but remember, she can only remain a shadow. i will walk down the hallway alone on sunday night, carrying my Directional Light in my hands like a lantern. it gives away my position, my hopes and dreams. it is another doorway into my soul. having learned to expect less, but not to try more, i'll walk back down the hallway a few minutes later having gained nothing but a few cookies. my soul is written in latin. disappointment and surprise do not mix.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my phone gets fingerprints. everyone can relate to this. sometimes i will wipe the fingerprints off, usually with my shirt. breathe, give it a kiss, rub in a circular motion. whenever i do this, i feel like i am cradling an infant baby. a glass and metal baby. i'm afraid that eight years from now, i'll still be doing this same thing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i called home today and stayed on the line for one hour and five minutes. a good chunk of it was spent with my brother, with whom we talked about his current teachers at high school. immediately, and lasting throughout the entire conversation with him, the poison green gas of inadequacy filled my face, despite how long i talked to him. mom reminded me to eat healthy and didn't discourage me from buying myself an iphone because i would be using my own money. there was nothing wrong. i never raised my voice. it got really soft and i wondered how i sounded to her on the other end. weak, sickly? tired? i think i put more effort into my voice when i talked with david and mike over the phone. but mom shall be different. mom shall understand me. i hope to call at least once a week from now on.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i also managed to skype with asta today. she showed me her room, but i only really glanced at it because i was focused a little more on her. she looks different, a bit, somehow, from what i remembered of her. older. a little tired? her voice seems lower too. i don't know for sure if i would have been able to pair her voice with her if i heard it with my eyes closed. i told her she looked older. i looked at her through my screen, and tried to see the parts of her that she trusted me enough to let me in on. her lonely, crying, longing, begging halves. i just read a blog of hers in which she cries for help. can i offer some?<br/></div>

<div>today's words will read as follows</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>tonight my mind became caught in another black hole.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>concerning mother teresa's love paradox, i find it manifest in some odd places. namely domino's pizza delivery drivers. they probably simply go through some training, but i like to think that they simply have run out of love to give, and therefore have nothing but love left to give. i have to be careful to not throw the term &quot;love&quot; around like a ragdoll, but i am largely quoting here. contrast this to the lucky buddha delivery drivers. those are some sad people, working in such a sad place. i want to go there and order food just to catch another glimpse of their lives. do they have anything waiting for them outside of that miserable little building, ever?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i have agreed to meet anjaly by the campanile at 2 pm on wednesday. this will be less than an hour after i demo my cs 2110 homework to the same TA whom i demoed my homework to last friday, a katherine. when i see anjaly, i hope to initiate a hug if she doesn't, and i'm going to try, and not completely succeed, to animate myself. i'll silence my phone. we'll maybe talk for an hour? i'll get something to eat beforehand if i can. if not, i'll chew on a piece of gum so my breath won't smell bad. and i'll wait for her at one of the metal tables.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i keep projecting this strange future for myself where i'm living alone in an apartment. david lives alone in an apartment. asta lives alone in an apartment. i want to live alone in an apartment. i don't want roommates. jessie r. doesn't live alone in an apartment. she has roommates. sorry jessie. i will be secluded and here are some things which i think will make me happy: an iphone, a computer, a tv, an xbox, a refrigerator, a coffee maker, a toaster oven, a water filter, warm fuzzy slippers, and many other things. here they are: circumstances, and here i am: their victim.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>one, two, three, heuh! baby. sassy. man i'm pretty. do the monkey with me! come on! hey there, baby. yeah, whatever.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i keep deactivating, but then i get all these awesome cool status ideas. the difference they make is probably zero.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today i got scared when i peaked into the morrigan bean meeting room and saw marie, and a kid who i mistook to be paco. i looped around before walking in, and marie nearly didn't look at me at all. she has been to copenhagen. can you believe that?! the meeting was seriously discouraging, and i felt like a laughingstock. all of my brain cells were pointing at me and booing, yelling at me to get off the stage. i am so nothing, they said. i see less and less point in holding on, but i want to give myself a few more chances. they won't come cheap. that automatic subconscious excuse generator is whirring at full steam in the corners of my mind, feeding me cause after cause to stop and give up, hold it, you don't want to see them again, you don't want to try to do this, you can't do this. i don't really feel like proving them wrong. i turn left for the very reasons others choose to go right. it was another reality check, the reality being the usual: full of spikes, pitfalls, and tears, and dark purple gas. i usually only feel that heavy after walking out of a particularly terrible exam.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i would really like to explain my black hole tomorrow, when i'm magically more settled and fueled and will be able to spell my despair out perfectly. this habit needs to be fixed, i can't keep writing before bed.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>one last note to make is about michelle v.'s tumblr. i looked through her archives to the very beginning. the fact that she is now the person dating jonathan p. is insignificant. i wondered who she wrote her blog to. i wonder who her audience was and is. i wonder who she's addressing in the video she made in which she speaks to a camera as she guides it around her college dorm (that was two years ago).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>oh! today on the grocery bus i noticed the girl i paid so much attention to last week. the purple girl. we made eye contact for less than one second, maybe less than one half of a second. there should be a word for this.<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>

9-23, mon</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>see, here's the thing. all of my nervousness, the pressure, and the tension have a habit of not peaking until the last possible moment. only just before i walk into the room. as i move my arm to turn the handle. that's when my lungs shrink and disappear and the rain starts to fall. i walked into the room. because i had only seen it once, it's still new. i can't cross out any promises yet, from my list of potentials. there are brownies and lots of teas sitting on her counter. the only person not talking, aside from me, is another ant in the colony, whom i don't feel like going anywhere near. every room seems to come with a mirror now. i am no longer alone in crowded rooms. now i can also find myself in various corners, and finding myself is worse. i accidentally let fall to the floor a wedding invitation that was hanging from her fridge. i picked it up and stuck it back on, and she saw me do that and then smiled. i hurried through the open door. nobody wanted to sit. nobody wanted. to sit. from now on, when i get the chance, i'll be sure to sit. i did not say very much to her at all, even though i stayed until the end. when i wasn't saying, i listened, and what i listened to might as well have been a piece, titled &quot;Reality Check x&quot; where x is a large number. i hopped onto the train, sitting quietly and unnoticed in an unmarked car. the train stopped at careers, youtube, concerts, and iPhones. at each stop, everybody got off, and at the end of the hour-long ride i was the one left on that lonely train. as it slithered along tirelessly, speeding, whining, with merciless momentum, i glimpsed every character of the story, out up in the trees, out hiding in every empty building, out driving in every passed car. they come and go like nothing else comes and goes. slingshotted away. every body i pass is potential, lost. by now, my heart is freely bleeding potential. the lights of seen stars will float out of reach as i drift away from them into space. they will appear to dim and eventually become invisible. science has an available explanation for magnetism, but if they also have one for the force that pulls one person towards another, i don't want to hear it. when a person radiates the perfect colors, that dazzle me utterly, i forlornly try to get myself caught in her (inevitably her) gravity. &quot;look at me,&quot; i say. &quot;catch me,&quot; i say. but the currents in space whisk me away, and she continues on her own orbit, around a dazzling purple planet. this too, is true.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i never got the chance to tell them that i have only been to one concert in my entire life, even if i thought i had a good time there afterwards. if they had heard me say that, they might have felt like they were at a zoo. nobody sees cool animals every day, but when they do, do they go home to write a report on any of them?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>straight talk (on elizabeth): what we are witnessing is an infatuation in the making. gesture number one: the way she so briefly rested her head on her arm when indicating the manner in which she could get lost in new youtube music. because i never see her, there won't be much more. she has a compact laptop and is waiting on an iphone 5c. i want to be like her. the same thing has happened with steph and even with mary-ann. i want to be like them, in the most superficial ways possible.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i tried and did not succeed at successfully conveying the potential, lost that is contained within every former acquaintance i have the misfortune to bump into today. graduating from school equals graduating from them. in fact i've graduated from them already, quite early. the hypocrisy was kept under the radar, for this forlorn pulse was also directed straight towards two of the three people i was trying to talk to.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>small group used to be all about how marked up my paper was. tonight, i still maintained a barrier too strong. i've been trying to put up a brick wall against God. huff and puff, right? that's not the right thing to do, the right thing to do is stand in an open field and sing like a lunatic. i am being the opposite of what out i set out to be, and this is a very deadly sin.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>at the end of the meeting, monique mentioned thoughts that i had given up on long ago. a couple years back, i told her that she's beautiful. now, i would tell her that she has a riveting, pink nuclear-powered heart and i can see it when i look at her face. i stood up next to her, and she was a living, breathing, human thing, with lungs that deal with toxic fumes like mine. she and louisa have lovely bedrooms, i thought, i haven't seen a room like that since s____ held my hand for three seconds at the supermarket, dragging the idiotic sheep behind her. what would i pray for?<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>

9-24, tue</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i have to thank christine and lisa for what they told me about christine's boyfriend, huy, the other night. they asked me if i've talked to him, after i told them that i'm in a class that they know huy is also in. i said he never really looks at me. christine nodded knowingly and they both agreed that &quot;he's like that.&quot; i'm like that, too. and every time i see him he kind of pisses me off for as long as he remains within my field of vision, because he's like that. well the two of them may be okay with it, but hey, thank you for reminding me to not be like someone like him.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today i hovered within feet of john d. for a total of nearly 3 hours. this has happened and will happen every tuesday and thursday for the next 10 or so weeks. each minute is why i almost didn't mention wanting to return to barcelona at all last night while talking with monique. it's a classic study abroad ghost town story, though, don't worry. there really is nothing to be afraid of.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today i also thought about parallel universes, specifically regarding hayson and how he immediately rejected such an idea after i suggested it to him. probably some so-and-so about god following. then i thought about the tumblr mind and how it typically moves in the exact opposite direction. the tumblr mind would embrace the thought of parallel universes and all that happens in them. both are correct, and both are incorrect as well.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>straight talk on last night's small group:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the guy steve is sort of weird, and his primary purpose for me will be as another anti-role model and counterexample. last night he seemed to have chewed on a pencil monique lent him, and also keeps forgetting things we told him very recently. he may actually have some short-term memory problems. he told us how he fell out of a shopping cart once when he was very little or something, and how he was in a coma for several days after that, and how his head always hit the tops of doorways when his dad carried him on his shoulders. he didn't relay any of this in a way that made me care at all. he also sucks at talking, and i would describe the way he behaves by pointing to the way i functioned back in my second year or so. it's a way that really spurs me to animate myself more, because i hate zombies. steve is a zombie to me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i was a zombie, too. i was wearing jeans and my usual shoes and for some reason that made me feel very temporary in that living room, like i would be ready to go and get out of there as soon as the meeting ended. monique and allison did most of the talking. i faced away from allison and didn't say very much at all, due to my feeling high and above everybody, this piece of scripture, and God, which we have already identified as deadly, so that will be fixed next week. being greedy: i was glad david and dpak weren't there, because they would have made me less serious.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>midway through, louisa dropped in and started eating s'mores ice cream out of a half-pint container, and i think she finished it all...? and we gossiped about helen, which i had a lot of fun listening to. i'm going to write out what i learned, here: well we already know she eats a lot, but here we also see that she is incapable of holding her own; constantly leeching food from other people, claiming to &quot;feed bad&quot;, and then doing nothing about it. apparently she once basically stole half a pizza from kelly. she saw the pizza sitting on the countertop all alone, and took it and ate it. that i found hilarious, for you have to be pretty stupid to do such a thing.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and after that when monique asked for prayer requests, allison requested something about a football game, like that fucking matters, and i just said that my life has been quiet. monique asked me if i'm thankful for the peacefulness, or if i'd rather have it thunder, and i didn't know.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>then this is when i peeked into monique's and louisa's rooms and saw the christmas lights, rugs, and candles, and felt a raw, stupid, longing aspiration to be like them again.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>.end<br/></div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>peace or thunder? that was the question monique asked me on monday night that i couldn't answer. allison kind of joined in too, it was her who i said the word &quot;party&quot; to rather than &quot;thunder.&quot; would i prefer the quiet, or would i rather party? i don't even remember what i said, actually, because i'm afraid of one and tired of the other, and i probably only didn't say &quot;party&quot; because i don't like the way that that word sounds. i suppose it didn't fit in with the whole small group mood. of course i want to party. i want the thunder. of course saying or not saying either won't make any difference, and neither will how much they decide to pray for whatever i would have decided to go with. not that they would pray anyway. honestly, can you imagine allison and/or steve praying for each other? i may see what i want to see, but damn if it isn't so easy to spot. my eyes aren't fooling me entirely, are they? i can see the golden flame in monique, and it's there. i see nought but mud in the other two, and i'm certain that it's there as well. fakery. insincerity. the levels they exhibit are laughable. this is another reason why i am drawn to monique so heavily. it's because she's so real. for lack of a better word, but it's true. before you start making judgments though, remember to consider yourself. ah, for you will never utter so much as a single word of prayer for them. why should they do the same for you then? remember to stop trying to overlook the other people. you're not as spiritual and magical as you think, and nowhere near as much as you want to be. in this moment, i realized how much real color i'm lacking. bland, silver. you're no different from them after all. come back when you open your mind much wider and still taste this bitter sourness. i guarantee you that you won't be so repulsed if you actually try to get a feel for people.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday there was hayson. i saw him in klaus. i walked up to him and softly said &quot;...hayson?&quot; and i could barely see him, from the other end of the giant chasm that had opened up between our feet since we last turned around. every question he asked me tore the ground open even more. what class did i just have? what are my threads? do i still go to ACF? i tried to remember who he knew and who he doesn't know, and i could only remember sam, mike, and kelly, and i didn't really want to mention kelly. even i simply asked him what he was doing here. this is his fifth year now. he's still using his white macbook. it's the same macbook that i saw him working on probably the same class material as what i'm working through now, 3 years later. when he said we should hang out, a meteor came crashing straight into the canyon's big mouth, ripping it apart and completely destroying any chance of our making the way across. i said yeah. a second, slightly weaker meteor came and hit the same spot.</div>

<div>would you happen to remember this one moment, that occurred on this earth nearly at least two years ago? here, let me describe it to you. it took place at starbucks, and was an appointment a year or so delayed. you bought me one of my first starbucks drinks, a chai tea latte. i took a sip from my cup, and thought it was disgusting. nevertheless i drank the entire thing, while simultaneously drinking in your words that you spoke to me, while i did my best to listen and nod. the things you said concerned yourself and God. oh, how i wanted to be just like you. i may have not found you attractive but you were still so beautiful in different ways, ways i had never seen. i thought i was more than a guinea pig to you, but you didn't even bother experimenting on me. you fed me no drug of any sort, and my brain remains unaltered to this day, despite your encouragements ringing like a golden bell in my head after they left your fucking mouth. the next day, i bought myself a second chai tea latte, even though i hated the taste of it, because what i really wanted was the taste of you again. today, i have no inclination for either.<br/></div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>would you happen to remember this one moment, that occurred on this very planet seven to eight hundred days ago? here, let me describe it to you. it was an appointment a year delayed, but late than never, they say? you bought the chai tea latte for me. when i took the first sip from my cup, only my tongue found it disgusting. but i drank the entire thing, while simultaneously drinking the words you spoke to me, all the things you said concerning you and God. oh, how i wanted to be just like you, you, so beautiful in different ways, then new. i thought i was more than a guinea pig to you, but you didn't even bother experimenting on me. you fed me no drug of any sort, and so my brain and its power source remain unaltered to this day, despite your pats on my back ringing like a golden bell in my head after leaving your fucking mouth. the next day, i bought myself a second chai tea latte even though i had hated its taste, because really, i just wanted to taste you again. today, i have no inclination for either.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>here is why considering elizabeth d. makes me sad: i am not, and probably never will be, a critical source of hers. and who are my own critical sources? and of what? soul fragments? i don't think i have a say in who i decide to see these full-of-stars souls in. they just appear. and they subsequently disappear, just as quickly, before i ever get a chance to grab a hold of them. they're like cars in the opposite highway lane. time always seems to stand still when you look at a clock, but, we're actually huge bodies moving through space at thousands and millions of miles per hour. we are planets. we are entities. we each have a million unique ecosystems, all containing untold billions of colors and life forms unique to us. what a shame it is that we hop across so many galaxies and solar systems but never find a permanent star system to call a home.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>with some people, all i need to do is peer into their eyes and i'm suddenly able to see how much i'm missing. i see so many could-have's and if-only's and the accumulative mass of lost potential simply crushes me. some people are, inexplicably, just a different color. elizabeth d, the girl with the long curly hair and the samsung series 9, the INTA girl. what is it about them? i cannot tell. if there is a formula i can figure out, maybe i'll be golden. i'll be about like a mad scientist trying to derive this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i will refer to this everyday phenomenon as swinging, as in when two people happen to swing by each other, defying the universe's odds. when gravity binds them together, though, that's a rare thing. what usually happens is simply this. after a couple decades of the universe's calculations, the two finally appear to converge, and they get closer and closer together, bound to collide as their courses intersect, and then…nothing. they swing. they swing by each other, and the thing ends.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a lot of people have swung by me recently. they include lisa, christine, ritchie, steph, anjaly, and the girl teresa.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i think lisa pretends to not notice me now. unless i'm unusually observant or something. i refuse to believe that anyone can be so oblivious. but i walk past her, she walks past me, and neither of us say anything to each other. like cars on the highway.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm still surprised by how animated christine becomes when she talks to me. it's like i'm actually her friend. if i didn't have the constant warning going off in my head that now prevents me from falling into that trap, i'd be toast.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>so yesterday ritchie and appeared. steph is the one who, when i look at her, see her smiling at me, see her waving at me, or think about her doing one or both of those, reminds me of a broken down, ancient stone temple that has been abandoned for centuries. that temple is the house of our friendship, which never took off or blossomed in any way, despite my pathetic attempts at fueling it. again, untold stories in a lost void, as deep as her eyes. i tried to talk with ritchie, and all that i could say was about iOS 7 and Android and to my horror (and slight amusement), my voice had become zombified. so i guess he's out. while steph and i ate, he cradled his phone in his hand. after telling them about my text conversation with the guy who messaged me, not realizing he has a wrong number, ritchie showed us his own &quot;troll&quot; conversation in which he talked dirty to some woman who messaged him by mistake. so there's another side to the rest of them, too. how could i not see that? be so blind to the dark sides of all those moons?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>anjaly canceled our appointment for yesterday, which is now an of-course thing. today she gave me a less-tight hug when we rushed past each other. i said two words to her, hey and bye. &quot;my friends are leaving me, &quot; she said, before running away.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i suppose nothing ever comes out of these swings because we choose that outcome. case in point, i noticed teresa !!! while exiting the 3790 classroom, and did not stir whatsoever. i can't complain now because this is why.<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>yesterday I saw many people in my LCC class at the student center food court. here is what it felt like seeing them not in the classroom.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I felt like I was in a movie. or rather, backstage. the room is a frozen glass cage. the food court was warm. the ice melted, and &quot;broke,&quot; if you will. even though everyone dressed the same as I'd always seen them, I think I have somehow been storing the memories of them all in suits and shirts and ties. only after I saw them not with glass eyes did i see them as real people, actual humans, with families, siblings, lost friends, heartaches , photographs, and two lungs and a heart. their strands of life trail behind them, invisible. it was almost too much for me to handle. I was standing in front of Sylvia Plath's fig tree, but the figs, instead of falling to the ground withering, flew up into the sky out of all possible reach. lost potential times ten, creating a black hole. this was a very sad day for me. I'm part of this group…but not really. at all, sometimes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Ethan is the guy who poked me, hard, in the shoulder while asking me for my name. I had to repeat it to him four times before he finally understood. After one of those times, he mistook &quot;dan&quot; for &quot;jen.&quot; this annoyed me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Austin is the guy who reminds me of one of my study abroad classmates. he found a programming class on data structures very difficult, while i had found the same class very easy. I stopped myself from humbly bragging, of course.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Jessica is the girl who looked at my experience presentation. this day was the first that I had spoken to her since then. she has a sister. her hair is longer than her sister's hair. her name is longer than her sister's name.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Sarah is the girl who looks like AnnaSophia Robb. she smiles all the time. I hope I dream about her.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I don't remember what Christina even looks like.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Monica gave me her name, and then I probably told her my name, and then we walked away from each other.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Feng Bo is the chinese girl. I tried to tell her I have the same last name, but I don't know if she heard me. I had a short, intensely prototypical conversation with her. I said I've had several job interviews. she said that she hasn't had any yet! I heard her.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Chelsea, I thought her name was Cara initially because I could hear her and somebody else talking about the name &quot;Cara.&quot; but Chelsea's name isn't Cara, it's Chelsea. I was really confused.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Alan is the guy whose name I wrote down before talking to him. I did that because I had just learned that I will need to be able to provide a list of ten names of the people I talked to. I don't have ten names, I only have nine. the tenth person is myself, because who do I talk to more than everybody else in the world combined?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I watched the video in which he discusses why he doesn't want his kids to have cell phones, and even though it's something that's somewhat vague I think I know what he means. and so does everyone else who's heard him, probably, based on everyone's reactions. at the same time, I think I feel something slightly different. what was it, that sad feeling that he described, that s-a-d feeling. is it what I experience when I slip into my ordinary miserable state, and say the &quot;hi&quot; to a bunch of people. that's not quite the phone thing, but it could be similar enough. do I let it pass now? I don't know, I think i'm feeling it now more than ever, and not when thinking about people I know, or have known and lost. but rather, when thinking about and glancing at people I barely know at all. the whole fall-in-love-with-a-stranger thing is beginning to get way out of hand for me. dangerously, I fear. the answer to the question &quot;what am I going to do when the sun sets again and I'm just as barren as when it rose?&quot; is simple: the same thing I've always done, whether it's nothing or not (and it most likely is just nothing). I'm on one of those brinks again. I'm very close to the cliff now, and am at that event horizon where every further step taken, every tick on the clock begins to alarmingly matter.<br/></div>

<div>this dream-reality line gets really blurry. i want to say that a setting will feel like a dream even if it's drawn out for months at a time, and also when it lasts just hours. of course the shorter ones will feel more dream-like. i think i have a lot to say about this lifeguarding business, and i don't know where to start, but i always start chronologically so here it goes. i didn't write anything about this yesterday or on thursday. i didn't interact with as many people on those days. the lead instructor is a 22-year-old girl named hannah who i think reminds me of someone, but i'm not sure. now that i've known her for 16 hours, she's her own piece now, and i'll never know if there's anyone else who she would have reminded me of. for some reason thinking too much about her makes me uncomfortable. thinking about a lot of the people there makes me uncomfortable. i don't want to mention their names. why don't i want to mention their names? there shouldn't be anything wrong with their names.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>tonight i reactivated facebook just for the 0.01% chance that i will become acquainted with one or more of the people there.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the whole thing reminds me of a summer camp. those are typically the only times i've ever been around pools to not swim endless laps by myself. i really can't remember for the life of me if i have ever taken lifeguard training classes before. all i can remember is swimming with a red rescue tube.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>a lot of the rescue tactics they teach have funny names, and they make up their own nicknames for some of them.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the instructor ashley is not jackie.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i didn't really talk to anybody at all on thursday. i swam behind a girl with short hair who makes me think of a turtle cheesecake. i think it's just her skin tone, short hair, and face. i don't know. it doesn't mean anything after all. i started paying attention to her and two other girls, one whose name i learned is Nica or Nika and the other, a filipino who i don't know. they somehow became distinct. i actually walked behind the two of them home on thursday night, already with the sad melancholy feeling that glows inside of me after any sort of social gathering in which one or more people become distinct. it glows like an ember is a dying fire.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the next day, i paid attention to a couple more people. one is a girl named Liz, maybe, who keeps hanging around a dude with a pointy nose. i can't tell if they know each other. i kept glancing at them a lot. she touched him a lot.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>there are lots of instructors so when we practiced the rescue tactics we got divided into groups and i like my group. i like my instructors. one kind of makes me think of kyle k. but not to a great extent, and i'm glad of that. the other is called Bailey and she has a very calm-looking, serene face and is quieter than most of the others.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today i continued to sort of pay attention to and talk to the same few people, mostly staring at them more than saying or doing anything else (which scares me). a girl named Clara partnered with me during several paired activities, and my mind ran its usual bizarre train. we did a bunch of skits in class today to cover various injuries, and i think i played my part in my group's skit fairly well. we got the loudest applause. i'd like to think that i played my part well enough. i wasn't as scared. i wasn't trying to impress anybody. during the later skits, i noticed a lot of bad awkwardness</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the vibe i'm getting from this is so enormously different from that of ACF that i almost want to puke. i will only work here for a year at most, before i get up and go. the time hasn't even begun, and it's already tinged with the sadness, the sad purple of twilight before dawn. if we'll all be working here, that would mean that i'll be seeing these people around every once in a while...but what will come of it?<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
9-29, sun</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>after the last 7-8 hours of my lifeguard class passed, it feels like nothing that happened this weekend ever transpired. of course, it's because i didn't take away anything from it with me that...is alive. by that i probably mean friends. i even tried asking mike about it, but he was unresponsive as usual. he assumed i was asking about facilities when i texted him, before i mentioned aquatics. i don't see it happening. i instead saw a horrifying new vision, the kind that will inevitably come true just from thinking about it. sitting with a group and not joining.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i tried tailing the same several people i tailed yesterday, and tailed some new ones, but it's all for nothing i guess, because i wasn't proactive enough. the tests aren't important. those aren't what the heart is going to dwell on. all i can think about is if it's going to be any lighter at all or any heavier when i leave this place, even after having branched off to here. is it going to make a difference? i'll have to wait and see. this is what i'm afraid of almost as much as i am of being on active duty.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this is the sad feeling that louis c.k. was talking about, only i have nobody to text. wait a minute. i just texted mike earlier today, didn't i? it's true! and it of course didn't work.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>the girl who played &quot;my mom&quot; in our group's skit yesterday is named kaitlin, and i only know that because i peeked at her buzzcard or something else on it that had her name printed on it. i know very few people's names, after this weekend together. mind exhausted, worked into a frenzy, and there's the sinking sadness. i know a bunch of first aid procedures now, but that's all i learned, and nothing else. not even their names, hardly. i didn't take a single person away from this. that's all i can think about. how i didn't say bye to anybody. i know i'll see these people again, but after the horror vision today i'd rather not, i think. every sight of them will just remind me. they'll only serve to sink me further, i realize now. i suppose that's another one of the things that don't change by themselves.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>one is &quot;Kaitlin&quot;, the other Amanda, another &quot;Nica&quot;, the final &quot;Mindy.&quot; i'm pretty sure it was those four. i remember how they decided to run off and test out without me. and it's nothing personal at all, whether to me, or any of them. to them, i'm just someone they pass on the most regular of routines, and to me, they're all the strangers i ever loved.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>my hope is becoming ever increasingly foolish.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>as i left today, i tasted that bittersweetness so strongly. i was jealous of the girl &quot;Liz&quot; because i didn't have anybody to walk out of the building with today. i walked a distance behind the filipino girl and her mermaid/asr friend, pretending i was a plane. i spotted the filipino girl again walking her final distance to her dorm, i suppose, and thought that she couldn't possibly be feeling what i was feeling. but what if she was? she, and all the people whom i ignored. yes, thinking and hoping that i'm not the only one will always make me feel better. and it's a real possibility, too. what if? and i STILL keep turning my head in the wrong direction, not speaking when i should.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>and, oh, the leaving. this whole thing is nearly inexplicable to me, yet all at once also completely expected. part of me wants to go home and stay home and never have anything to do with this. the few memories now will be less painful, i tell myself. i'll just endure. the only reason i'm already thinking of trying to be a lifeguard somewhere else is because i want it to make me think of this. i want this to have its own soundtrack. there are already such complex vibes bound to the word &quot;lifeguard,&quot; and i will never look at the aquatics hallway the same way again. two year ago i had no clue that it ever existed. yesterday it was a very boring, drab, empty hallway with no significance whatsoever. today, tomorrow, and for the rest of forever, it will be a memory superhighway. how does this happen? my soul is crying. my soul does not understand. and what will it take, for this to go away?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i haven't spoken to monique since last monday. if i go to small group tomorrow, i'll see her again. i'll want to talk to her again. i'll want to be her friend again. just now, i thought, what's the point? friendships do spoil. how long will it take this one to rot and wither? if i was any<br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<hr/>
9-30, mon</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>this whole fall-in-love-with-a-stranger thing is getting way out of hand. I described my most profound case yet yesterday.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>today I saw Hayson again. if he hadn't turned and seen me, I probably would have just let him pass by. I explained the class I was waiting outside the room for, 2110, and that I remember watching him work on this same class's homework, 3 years ago. he touched me on my arm twice, and I didn't move either time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in class, roommate wesley decided to plop his ass in the seat next to mine, asking me questions about registers and instructions that he doesn't have a clue about, but will somehow figure out in time. on his other sat his fat friend who i saw yesterday in our living room. whoever he is hadn't installed the softwares needed to do the homework yet. i think he's fat and lazy, and will be up to his neck in schoolwork soon. this is making me a little smug. he also kept coughing and wheezing. so his body is not in good condition.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>after this class, i walked out the door to see lisa sitting at the tables outside the room. i used to become excited whenever i saw her. i think she used to be much more excited whenever she saw me. now we're completely nonchalant. &quot;super meh.&quot; that's her perfect way of putting things in recent light. all we talked about again were our classes and other school things. she had to go to the bathroom before we left the building. i watched her walk. the building was very quiet and there were two other people sitting at the other tables. once outside, lisa remarked that it was warm, and i became very quiet. we bumped our arms together once, and she said sorry. she also talked about something with christine and how they were feeling sad one night or something. i didn't have anything to say to her when she kept telling me that she was doing badly in her cs2050. i tried empathizing with her by saying that my junior year was a shitty year. she seems to be having a not so good time right now.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'm going to pretend that she wanted to walk with me and talk with me, instead of taking a bus back to the ULC. that way it would take longer. it's probably not true, but pretending doesn't take hope. we said very unceremonious byes to each other.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>i'd decided to scrap small group plans for this week too. the only reason i would have wanted to go is the potential outlet there, and i'm too afraid to use it. and i didn't use it. monique said i should still come over to eat, so i did, and we shared our usual highs and lows and i ended up telling the three of them that i'm a certified lifeguard now. but i told them nothing else. all of the feelings i had bottled up in my chest are still there, the pressure still squeezing because i kept my mouth so tightly closed. this is what i mean when i said that i didn't use my outlet.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>in the moment where i was standing in the kitchen alone with eric l. and the other guy in the small group, it occurred to me again how quiet the air becomes when i'm left alone with people. in this case i didn't care, because it was just eric l. it was just him, and i didn't feel anything because i don't care about him. he is ignored. if it was someone else, then i would have cared. if it was &quot;clara,&quot; or &quot;mindy,&quot; i would have cared. if it was either of them, i would have felt woefully sad and wanted to cry. what a difference the person makes. and, of course, they have not the slightest clue. this is almost sadly almost beautiful.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>what else do their faces evoke? the final image. the long stretch, and how impossible it seems to ever be able to cross it, no matter who. they are light from immensely distant galaxies, that i can never hope to reach in my lifetime, light that does not come from the present moment but is only either a reminder or a hopeless hope. they exist in my dreams. in my dreams i can visit whatever stars i wish. in my dreams, i'm not constantly stopping myself. in my dreams, i know i can't die, and won't try to kill myself.<br/></div>

<en-note style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;">
9-14 n
<div><br/></div><div>church was the highlight of the day. i stuck to it this time, and arrived after the worship. didn't listen to the message, didn't listen to the &quot;sunday school.&quot; especially the latter. it held no meaning to me and i'm ready to accept that and see what happens. all the while i attacked the ideologies to ROdNEY, to see what he has to say and to relieve my insecurities.</div><div><br/></div><div>i ate lunch with them this time. felt like an asshole taking the food handed to me. discussions at the table. one topic: how far beneath the surface people like their relationships to be.</div><div><br/></div><div>nathanie sat down next to me and struck up a conversation like it was nothing. she had been up in my hometown in NJ recently and is thinking of moving there. what the fuck?</div><div><br/></div><div>somewhere in the middle i mentioned my brother, whom david had no idea about, and i decided to let slip that it was my birthday too. i knew they didn't know. steph said that she and david are horrible friends. no, i don't think so.</div><div><br/></div><div>they wanted to &quot;do something&quot; just as i wanted, and the decision was made on a bakery somewhere, where i had myself a seriously shitty cupcake.</div><div><br/></div><div>then it was back to the church where i stayed until it closed. we/they talked about a few things (the guy whose name is matt, the girl who reminds me of jen zhao). arranged marriages, work ethic, inconsiderate roommates, sam. steph kept playing with my lego keychain. if sam were wondering what steph was doing at that moment, i would have known the answer.</div><div><br/></div><div>i'm supposed to be having dinner with david tomorrow.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
9-15 m</div><div><br/></div><div>today i spent my time at the office in a relatively new depression. read a few thought catalog articles and felt slightly panicked and anxious for the rest of the day. i guess i've spent too much time away from these thoughts. they've grown while i look away.</div><div><br/></div><div>i think this weekend, with ROdNEY's inadvertent help, i have officially resigned from God. he will still be here, but i won't be looking for him. is it okay to meet God and say no? look at all of the ACF people and all they have done for me. where they <u>ever</u> right for me? around whom am i most natural? most importantly, i hope it's not too late.</div><div><br/></div><div>david ditched me again. the gym was more important. it's pathetic that i label him as my closest friend here, because i'm sure i mean nothing to him.</div><div><br/></div><div><u>DO NOT</u> stay in <u>the past</u>.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
9-16 t</div><div><br/></div><div>i spoke ever so slightly more than usual at the restaurant today. it only made me proud of myself because the fat kid never talks too, and is always seen on his phone, never looking at anyone else, during lunchtime. has a cold demeanor about him. this must be what i was like in year three. how horrifying!</div><div><br/></div><div>jessie messaged me today and it took all of two minutes for me to start fantasizing. she did so because she saw me crossing the street. i have to wonder why she bothered contacting me and why she once again wishes to &quot;catch up.&quot; and just appreciate that she does. beware my expectations, though, they will kill me.</div><div><br/></div><div>my conversations with rodney are becoming more frequent. he'll be the next big online friend. some of what he predicts about me is accurate. his philosophies are interesting, but he's a very specific type of person.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
not until the 27th of September</div><div><br/></div><div>per asta's encouragement i went to stone mountain with steph and co. i wanted to chicken out at first because i just wasn't excited to see any of them. here is what i will remember.</div><div><br/></div><div>i think ritchie and i are at about the same level in terms of sociability and overall person likability. although i have a nasty feeling that i'm wrong. for a significant portion of the day he was as aloof and quiet as i was. the group consistently adopted a mock hostility attitude towards him.</div><div><br/></div><div>my most positive interactions were with steph, which is saying quite something. i felt a tiny hint of some strange type of pride the last time she told someone that i was the first person ever she met at ACF. while we were laying on the lawn, i played the bioshock version of the 1918 song 'after you've gone' and she wanted to hear it a second time. propped my phone up next to her as she lay on her stomach.</div><div><br/></div><div>most of the time, i was ignored and/or outspoken whenever i said something. it's so easy to hate the others for not noticing/caring.</div><div><br/></div><div>monique said &quot;shit&quot; and chris/ritchie freaked out. (exaggeration. but still ridiculous)</div><div><br/></div><div>i sat next to monique on the shuttle. this was when she was at her quietest. and i was reminded again of how i always seem to be a black hole for conversations. for whatever reason she said sorry for being quiet and then some about how much of an introvert she actually is. i couldn't hear half of what she said and the entire time she was distant. wouldn't look at me. felt more like she was talking to herself.</div><div><br/></div><div>i was glad that david wasn't here. if he and steph ever end up splitting, the reason i'll be happy has nothing to do with steph. it'll be because he'll be easier to exclude from my picture.</div><div><br/></div><div>i was desperately seeking positivity within myself.</div><div><br/></div><div>success/failure of the experiments is no longer relevant.</div><div><br/></div><div>eric (the unkempt one) patted steph's (bare) shoulder (somewhat awkwardly) and she shot him a dirty look.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
9-29 m</div><div><br/></div><div>the line between success and failure is fading, because i longer give myself opportunity to achieve either one. no opportunity for pain, what once hurt now makes me feel nothing... and sometimes angry. there is a theme of hopelessness, losing faith, and numbness here. a nuclear powered carrier needs to be fueled about once every twenty years. now i have surpassed its range. i've programmed myself to feel betrayal when it becomes clear that i'm no priority. the simple truth, now crystal clear, is that not a single person who is or was dear to me at any point in time gives a flying fuck about me. and they shouldn't. i won't waste anyone's time. i better make damn well sure i handle myself on my own.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-10 r</span></div><div><br/></div><div>i&apos;ve been thinking a lot to this time last year. this time last year i was waking up at 6 in the morning to get to the office before the sun rose. i think i was with harry in the small windowless room about then.</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s been almost two weeks since i first met up with alice. she basically asked me to smoke weed with her and buy her alcohol. she&apos;s a manifestation of some of my biggest fears. i always knew there were alices everywhere, but i didn&apos;t really know. i forget most of the time what exists.</div><div><br/></div><div>my opinions of chris and mark have gone down. more so with chris. not worth dissecting too much, it&apos;s clear why. today they pretty much denounced the concept of marriage. i don&apos;t know the details of mark&apos;s situation, but i&apos;m pretty sure chris has no experience to draw from. my next worst fear is that i will become him. whether or not it happens depends on i don&apos;t know what. a while ago i learned that he&apos;s 35 years old. that&apos;s ten years older than i thought he was.</div><div><br/></div><div>my birthday is coming up in four days now. i made it visible again on facebook and know i&apos;m going to be sitting there waiting for some messages. should i tell anyone at the office?</div><div><br/></div><div>krish has grown increasingly distant since i got back from home in early july. i think he doesn&apos;t want to hang out with me anymore. the vibe should have been evident in the few (two) times we&apos;ve met up since. i had wanted to text him something like &quot;are you dead?&quot; something nonchalantly humorous like that, but it makes me think of how insignificant i am in his life, as opposed to abby, and all of his other friends. he could be going through a hard time and a text like that from me would just be a total joke.</div><div><br/></div><div>there&apos;s a meetup scheduled to happen at the joystick gamebar again, and i see his response as going. i&apos;m not sure if i can force myself there when i have &apos;until dawn&apos; to play. but i want to see if he appears there. and ask him why he doesn&apos;t answer my texts anymore.</div><div><br/></div><div>i haven&apos;t really moved anywhere in over a year, then. same story again. i&apos;m nervous again to go out and meet people even though i feel more confident overall when i envision myself socializing. then again maybe I was always like this in my mind.</div><div><br/></div><div>the emotion from last year floods back so easily when i think about lights, truslow, and bioshock infinite. i&apos;m almost desparate for a new album to bind however i am now to. to reflect upon later still.</div><div><br/></div><div>i don&apos;t remember being terrified of how i was going to end up. but most everything&apos;s played out as expected. it&apos;s still me writing my goddamn play.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-11 f</span></div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s 100% evident to me that krish doesn&apos;t consider me a real friend. not like a &quot;true friend&quot; friend, just not even an actual friend.</div><div><br/></div><div>i followed through with my decision to go to the joystick meetup because i knew i would be letting myself down if i didn&apos;t. it went just as expected (doesn&apos;t everything). krish came there with two of his friends. they were from chicago. abbey showed up too. i don&apos;t know her disposition towards me but i actually found it easier to talk to her than to krish. at least she heard the words i said. krish always just seemed to want to stop talking to me immediately and leave.</div><div><br/></div><div>he rarely answers my texts anymore and clearly has little interest in keeping to the find-somewhere-new-to-eat-every-weekend plan. i don&apos;t really want to be with someone who doesn&apos;t care about me.</div><div><br/></div><div>when i was leaving for the bar my heart actually started beating faster. when i walked in i just stood in a corner for at least fifteen minutes just waiting for replies to my comments on the event page and my text to the organizer, named rie. refusing to ask anyone there if they were here for it. apparently she was there somewhere but we never met up. i stuck with krish, his two buddies, and abbey. we hung around the arcade machines for hydro thunder (i only won against abbey). two girls joined us and one of them was named jessica, and it reminded me of the &apos;until dawn&apos; character. didn&apos;t bother sticking around.</div><div><br/></div><div>i feel like alice is my only friend now. the problem is that she&apos;s five years younger than me.</div><div><br/></div><div>drove home a little bit drunk again. i had my fog lights on.</div><div><br/></div><div>krish said he&apos;d text me this weekend when i asked him if he wanted to get lunch. he said maybe sunday. he definitely doesn&apos;t want to.</div><div><br/></div><div>i&apos;m feeling like a worthless person again. if this time this year does mirror this time last year i don&apos;t think i would even mind.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-14 m</span></div><div><br/></div><div>happy birthday to me.</div><div><br/></div><div>i&apos;m pretty sure this time was even sadder than the last one. back then i spent a little bit of time with steph and david. not much, it&apos;s true, but it was somebody.</div><div><br/></div><div>four people wrote happy birthday to me on facebook, john manziano, enoch, brittany piscopo, and sarthak. i laughed. i&apos;m not acknowledging any of them.</div><div><br/></div><div>here&apos;s a short rundown, krish and v both texted me (alice did too but it was nothing). krish asked how i&apos;m celebrating and when i told him i had no plans, he asked why and then didn&apos;t care. why ask?</div><div><br/></div><div>brother texted last night and dad texted me in the evening. i called my mother and ended up sounding annoyed again (why do i always want to get off the phone with my parents?). my mom thought it was 2016 and so thought i was 24, causing me to become unsure of my own age for a moment.</div><div><br/></div><div>i didn&apos;t mention anything to my coworkers because there was no point. felt pretty good during my workout at the gym today though.</div><div><br/></div><div>i didn&apos;t even do anything special for myself. bought a pizza for dinner and ate by myself as usual. i guess you could consider the things i bought earlier in the month to be early presents but that&apos;s a stupid thought process.</div><div><br/></div><div>saddest birthday ever. i&apos;ll sit here by myself.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-30 w</span></div><div><br/></div><div>i walked into the apple store today intending to get an iphone 6s, yet another decision i made on a whim. this is the xth major purchase i&apos;ve made this year. i&apos;m a little worried for my delayed gratification willpower. a guy at the store approached me asking if i needed help and i went with my &quot;just gotta choose a color&quot; line. he was nice. maybe because i agreed to buy one right then and there. asked where i work. i wanted the monthly payment plan but it wouldn&apos;t work because my phone service is prepaid. so i left the store without an iphone, feeling like i dodged some kind of bullet, for now.</div><div><br/></div><div>eating fast food makes me feel really depressed. just being the type of person who eats fast food. i&apos;ve been to burger king four times in a week.</div><div><br/></div><div>everything feels so different this september from last september but i know some things are the same. it&apos;s just not new anymore. last year was all newegg and ghost stories and meetup and ACF remnants and depression.</div><div><br/></div><div>i saw alice for the second time last weekend. her voiced sounded different and it was confirmed to be because she was sick or something a short while ago. i can&apos;t remember her face. i wanted to take her to the restaurant don quixote but we were too close to its closing time so i had to settle for jalisco because it was another restaurant and it was open. bummer. i didn&apos;t want us to be somewhere that didn&apos;t make me think back to school.</div><div><br/></div><div>we went to the publix in the same &quot;strip mall&quot; and i bought her three bottles of wine for $42.50. not sure if i&apos;ll be getting it back. i want to smoke weed with her but i don&apos;t see how that&apos;ll possibly work. she said she would text me about it and i said okay. i don&apos;t think anything is going to happen. i can&apos;t be around people her age. she is so different from my brother. isn&apos;t she?</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-1 r</span></div><div><br/></div><div>I Can&apos;t Believe it&apos;s fucking September, my birthday is in two weeks. I hate grocery shopping so much. Pretty sure Alice has forgotten about me by now, and I&apos;m sad that I don&apos;t dream about my old apartment that I moved out of nine weeks ago. When I left Barcelona I dreamt about it for almost as long as I had stayed there. The lady at the pho&nbsp;<span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">restaurant said I look like I&apos;m only 21.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-8 r</span></div><div><br/></div><div>we&apos;ve reached the anniversaries&apos; anniversaries, and I&apos;m desperately trying to track my mood changes. for someone so obsessed with the past, I sure have a hard time remembering everything. what is there even to remember?</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-12 m</span></div><div><br/></div><div>receding ever more into the fog. they say you can&apos;t ever be more than halfway through the woods but I&apos;m way further than that in a swamp now.</div><div><br/></div><div>I read of a philosophy suggesting that there are two ways of navigating life, moving away from what you don&apos;t want or moving toward what you do want. I don&apos;t think I&apos;m even actively moving away from what I don&apos;t want. anymore. instead just doing the bare minimum to stay far away enough from only the things I don&apos;t want the most.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;ve returned to the japanese restaurant wagaya twice on my own now and I hate being there and waiting with all the other people inside. last week I spotted kelly (huang) and immediately decided to not notice her. she likely returned the favor.</div><div><br/></div><div>the guy doing returns at ikea was there when I went back last week and he recalled me again and called me by my name. someone else helped me with my return and as I was leaving I said to him, &quot;maybe I&apos;ll see you again, who knows?&quot; that was a 2014-level line. I&apos;m back to square 14.</div><div><br/></div><div>there was a beggar/homeless man outside of lucky buddha (because I haven&apos;t improved in that regard, either) and I tried to wave him off when I noticed him notice me as I walked inside, muttering, &quot;I&apos;ll be right out.&quot; turns out he actually heard me and when I tried to dodge him when I went back outside, he followed me to my car and asked for money. I gave him a dollar. should I have given him more?</div><div><br/></div><div>last friday Karel was really pressing me to sign up for an online product that some quick research revealed is certainly a ponzi scheme (so I learned what that is). I asked ROdNEY if he knew about it and apparently Karel hadn&apos;t pressed him about the same thing. so it was concerning for a couple reasons why he wanted me to join the thing so badly. ROdNEY suggested that he may be &quot;desperate&quot; for a &quot;miracle&quot; to &quot;fix his life.&quot; I said that that&apos;s kind of sad but he said I&apos;m in the &quot;same shit.&quot; I didn&apos;t agree.</div><div><br/></div><div>another time last week some idiot at chick fil-a couldn&apos;t hear me talking as I ordered even though she was standing right outside the (driver side) window. christian of course commented on it, I brought up speaking from the what-is-it-called-again diaphragm, and for once he kind of acknowledged his own problem with it. fairly often, I&apos;ll not respond to the things he says because I can&apos;t discern a single word, and don&apos;t feel like asking what?</div><div><br/></div><div>I do have things to be grateful to him for, but in the end people will always remember the way you made them feel? and to be honest, overall I don&apos;t feel good being next to him.</div><div><br/></div><div>this weekend I began replaying bioshock (1) and at nights I went to bed trying to recall late 2014 and burial at sea.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m also rewatching the office, and I expect soon it will become associated with this time period and detach from last year&apos;s. it may already have.</div><div><br/></div><div>my birthday is in two days and it&apos;s the saddest time of the year. my mom keeps urging me to do or get something nice for myself. she&apos;s the last remaining person in the world who cares about me, and it kills me inside to be reminded of it every time she borderline pleads with me to show myself a little care on this one day.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;ve been looking too far forward. already planning, in detail, for an insane three to four months in the distance, preparing to live with my mind suspended until then. it&apos;s a cycle that&apos;s been happening. the tumblr &quot;martyrd&quot; appears to have been active again for a while, and she wrote in her diary, &quot;Always living in the future makes the present seem tedious.&quot; almost twelve and a half years ago. and here I am discovering it now. the problem is that looking forward to something has been the only thing that could make me feel a little happy.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-14 w</span></div><div><br/></div><div>(it&apos;s my birthday and for the third time I can remember, I don&apos;t know what to say.)</div><div><br/></div><div>[wednesday]</div><div><br/></div><div>on monday christian asked me again if I ordered My wrist straps yet and I just lied to him and said yes so I wouldn&apos;t feel judged. I&apos;d been planning to...because he kept asking me. I ordered them later that day after I went home.</div><div><br/></div><div>I feel like Bina doesn&apos;t want to talk to me as much as she used to.</div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s funny, today I asked DOOGIE how long it&apos;s been since we met in-game and he thought it was two, maybe three years. when in reality, it hasn&apos;t even been a year and a half yet. I don&apos;t remember the exact time but it was sometime around may/june last year. I wonder if it&apos;s because he&apos;s older that it seems like such a longer time to him.</div><div><br/></div><div>I gave Marty my can of coke yesterday and this morning he repaid me with a 1.5 liter bottle of water from publix that turned out to taste terrible.</div><div><br/></div><div>this year bioshock runs from september 9th to today the 13th so far. I&apos;m planning on pausing at the final boss, to revisit burial at sea again, before attempting to use only the wrench to kill atlas. theoretically it&apos;d be interesting to relive the emotions again, but I don&apos;t have high hopes in my ability to anymore. this environment is too different.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-17 s</span></div><div><br/></div><div>Bina was the only one I bothered telling about my birthday on wednesday. I said i&apos;m 24 now and she made a face as she told me I&apos;m so young. that&apos;s not going to last much longer.</div><div><br/></div><div>I spent over $300 on three pieces of clothing that day. it actually wasn&apos;t really at the behest of my mom, who kept telling to get myself something and that she&apos;d pay me back for it. it almost makes me cry to hear that. I don&apos;t want her to pay me anything.</div><div><br/></div><div>the fall equinox is september 22. I can&apos;t wait for the daylight to become shorter again.</div><div><br/></div><div>my parents shouldn&apos;t still be taking care of my plane tickets for me, but they arranged my thanksgiving flight, asking me if a layover in philadelphia would be okay. ordinarily I&apos;d be annoyed, but I agreed with it this time so I&apos;d have more time to listen to music and reminisce.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-22 r</span></div><div><br/></div><div>last weekend I was able to drag myself to the varner&apos;s tavern for a meetup event with the Angie&apos;s group. there were few people there, thank god, and I only talked to two of them, one of whom was the Rob. the same Rob that I first met almost two years ago now. so he still comes here, and I learned that he&apos;s 40. this was almost as surprising as finding out that chris is 35 (probably 36 now). and at least as insane. I don&apos;t want to still be like this when I&apos;m that old. it&apos;s like everywhere I look I see all these warning signs. foreshadowing. there must be a reason that the same people (me included!) still frequent this meetup group.</div><div><br/></div><div>he said something about wishing he were 25 again, and I asked if he didn&apos;t have a good time back then. he said it wasn&apos;t that, just isn&apos;t it always better to be young? I didn&apos;t say that I had just turned 24 earlier in the week.</div><div><br/></div><div>I had no interest in the trivia (although I did help with the answer to one question) and left early unceremoniously. I wore my red flannel shirt and found myself not knowing what to do with my hands again.</div><div><br/></div><div>one rainy evening I was waiting for food from lucky buddha (again) and I looked out the window and imagined the weather to be cold, and that somehow brought on a rush of nostalgia. I can distinctly recall one other random moment when I walked outside into chilly air and thought of memories I can&apos;t remember. so cold weather is nostalgic somehow.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;m starting to be unsure if having these daily workouts as my only exercise is going to be beneficial for me in the long run. I&apos;m always sore in some area on my body and I&apos;m becoming worried that it&apos;s only a matter of time before I develop some kind of permanent, long term health problem. as much as chris&apos;s conversations about many people out there not knowing what they&apos;re doing when it comes to health and fitness (which is true), sometimes I wonder if he could be one of them too, at least partly. I mainly started thinking of this when he picked up a pumpkin spice cookie and said it had good fats. despite how much more he can lift than me, he still can barely do a pull-up and was winded after a brief jog to the car in some rain. wouldn&apos;t being able to do those things matter more? I know I&apos;m just being smug and haughty when I think about those. I&apos;m always trying to figure out if he has his shit together. why does that matter so much to me? and I&apos;m just blindly following him as he follows this 60-day program. I don&apos;t know what he has in mind afterwards. I want to try to swim and/or run again, but clearly not enough.</div><div><br/></div><div>we&apos;re in the evening of the year and before I know it it&apos;ll be twilight for the third time. whenever I think of the beginning of the year I imagine morning, the middle of the year midday, summer afternoon/evening, and fall evening/night. with some winter night in there too. always alone, always quiet. this weekend was just another typical waste. I can&apos;t keep doing this. I&apos;ve made my own environment so dangerous to me. and I feel, to this day, so stuck. nothing&apos;s different enough.</div><div><br/></div><div>I wish I could remember january-april/may better. should have put more effort into the music.</div><div><br/></div><div>suddenly I recalled one of my college years, as I stood on the marta train platform at the airport after having landed coming from home. how strange it felt to be back at then-school after just a few days home. these violent transitions gradually become ordinary. and this is how people turn into zombies. sometimes I think I wouldn&apos;t mind dying a little younger.</div><div><br/></div><div>lately I have been staying at the office later more frequently, because it just doesn&apos;t feel as long. like until 6 pm or so. very little time seems to pass between the time I get back from the gym and when I next look at the clock. I used to want to leave earlier so I&apos;d have more time to sit in my apartment, but I don&apos;t value that time as much anymore. I realize now it makes little to no difference. similar things happen there at night...I can go nearly an hour without checking the time before realizing how late it&apos;s gotten, and have no idea what I was doing in that entire interval.</div><div><br/></div><div>I sent sam a text a few days ago...desperate failure. I copied and pasted the message that was the complete song/artist/album title for &quot;safe and sound&quot; by taylor swift. I thought the first time I sent him that was some time after I graduated, but when I found the original message in my phone&apos;s history it turned out to be in january 2014. while I was still in school. I don&apos;t remember that at all. I&apos;m not even sure if sam was one or two years ahead of me.</div><div><br/></div><div>I wish I could remember more images from college times.</div><div><br/></div><div>february 2017 will basically be tomorrow so I may then &quot;officially&quot; revisit my first diary entries.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-30 f</span></div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s become so extraordinarily difficult to begin ANYTHING. i finally sit down to begin and the first i want to go is get back up and go away.</div><div><br/></div><div>my parents have come back down here for the weekend. they arrived yesterday, and i nearly cried myself to sleep last night, for all the wrong reasons.</div><div><br/></div><div>being fully honest with myself is difficult again, too.</div><div><br/></div><div>there now definitely is a negative correlation between my immediate mood and their presence, which is troubling...these dreams i&apos;ve had where i become extremely angry at my dad, i&apos;m worried one is going to come true. it kind of happened already in may. i really don&apos;t want to think about it. it&apos;s like i want to become upset and angry, and gather up every bit of reason i can find. i think i&apos;m crossing the line from pet peeve to OCD. the stress itself stresses me out. i&apos;m so completely unaccustomed to company that having any bothers me to a ridiculous degree, no matter who it is. my careful rules, everywhere, broken. i know they&apos;re all terribly unreasonable, even for myself, but i can&apos;t keep myself calm unless i follow what i&apos;ve set.</div><div><br/></div><div>i think i was only excited about the drive to the airport. just one small, new thing to do. before my mom and dad even found me i was already becoming annoyed that they couldn&apos;t find their way out of the terminal...that they had never been in before. then they met up with jimmy&apos;s parents and were loud and yelling and greeting each other enthusiastically. i thought it was almost obnoxious. i wanted to leave because we weren&apos;t supposed to wait and loiter in the pick-up area. yeah, for some reason i cared that much about following the rules. i thought about and felt like christian. i suppose i really am becoming like him by spending each day with him at the gym. a nearby young woman looked at them and smiled, and my opinion changed instantly.</div><div><br/></div><div>i took them to eat at the japanese restaurant wagaya. my dad recognized the area we were in. i paid for the dinner. when the guy came back after swiping my card, he handed it my dad, not realizing that i was the one paying for them. i felt a little proud.</div><div><br/></div><div>it felt strange having them in my home. i suddenly had nothing to do, because normally all i do is sit in front of the computer 100% of the time. with that taken away, i had nothing else to do.</div><div><br/></div><div>my mom always notices that i don&apos;t look happy, and she&apos;s right. i don&apos;t know why i won&apos;t tell her anything. it&apos;s not like i have any secrets or any particular things i&apos;m too embarrassed to admit; i don&apos;t. i just don&apos;t know how i could possibly tell them how i feel. and this leaves me with not a single other person in the world whom i would both feel comfortable talking to, and who would understand. i think i&apos;m artificially inflating my depressive mood when my mom is nearby. i regress all the way to that method of getting attention, and it&apos;s so stupid...yet smiling around them just feels off. because that means i&apos;m feeling happy and ok and i don&apos;t feel that i&apos;m supposed to be that way. that isn&apos;t me.</div><div><br/></div><div>11:42</div><div><br/></div><div>because christian is away this week, i have been adamantly walking to the CRC by myself every day...i&apos;m a little certain i like it better when he&apos;s not here. walking around on campus is stirring up dim memories of being a student...the cooler, fall weather this week helps.</div><div><br/></div><div>13:43</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div>9-1 f</div><div><br/></div><div>so all of a sudden, it&apos;s september. I feel like the summer months this year have been the blurriest so far. actually, for the most part, this entire year has been less than a &quot;blur.&quot; just an empty blur. it&apos;s been over four months since I last did any actual work at the office, which is definitely a big contributor to the overall listlessness and purposelessness that&apos;s been dominating my daily life.</div><div><br/></div><div>every time I get caught up in christian&apos;s flaws, he ends up dissolving my lowly opinions of him again and again in the gym locker room when he comments on the progress I&apos;ve made. I may often feel awkward when I&apos;m around him, but he makes me feel good too. yesterday he made a positive remark on my arms, and I can&apos;t lie to myself and say that that didn&apos;t make me feel a little more confident about myself. that and how he keeps reminding me that the girls at chick fil-a always ask him about me when I&apos;m not with him when he goes. &quot;because [I&apos;m me].&quot; I don&apos;t know what that means.</div><div><br/></div><div>DOOGIE must get youtube notifications from my channel, because he always lets me know he&apos;s watching a video of mine and it&apos;s often quite soon after I upload it. this time he brought up an incident he had already argued with me about during that gaming session, blaming me for not killing a witch that he&apos;d accidentally shot. I was a little surprised with myself at how fiercely I argued back. I&apos;m not so much offended that he&apos;s pinning it on me, as much as amazed at his unwillingness to accept that he&apos;d made such a simple mistake. it&apos;s pretty easy to see through his behavior.</div><div><br/></div><div>I decided to let my brother in on it and even he immediately suggested that I &quot;stop being friends with someone who&apos;s that toxic.&quot; I think that&apos;s the most telltale advice I&apos;m ever going to get. Tracy and I still harp to each other aboutDOOGIE&apos;s tendencies. she revealed that he told her about the witch argument too. I don&apos;t know what she says to him, but in our conversation she sided with me. she&apos;s been my cathartic outlet for when DOOGIE starts becoming too much. I think she actually rage quit yesterday, and I&apos;m fairly certain that I understood how she felt, that it had more to do with him than the game. as nice as it is to bitch about him together, there should still be a limit to it though.</div><div><br/></div><div>Zora (now Z.) unexpectedly messaged me last night while playing cs:go. we gave each other small updates on how lives. I said little, but she told me about her job at bk (which I actually recall seeing when I&apos;d randomly looked at her facebook page a while ago) and how she&apos;s in a ldr with a military guy stationed in japan. who she met in minecraft. if you include the time she briefly liked me, that&apos;s now four different people that she&apos;s met online, in-game, and those are just the ones I know about. then she invited me to watch her play, and when she left, said she&apos;d message me again. it was all out of the blue but I&apos;m kind of happy that I was on her mind even if it was just for a little bit.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>9-8 f</div><div><br/></div><div>every day for the past many months, or rather couple years, has been a zero day. all I&apos;ve ever done is repeatedly masturbate myself by buying so many things that just wear off and die. this has been slowly killing me, too.</div><div><br/></div><div>&apos;life is strange: before the storm&apos; is the latest new. too bad all of my other failures are overshadowing it. picking soundtracks for my so-called &quot;phases&quot; of life has become a tiny project.</div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;ve been really into high school dramas lately, with 13 reasons why, stranger things, and now life is strange again. I think it&apos;s because they make me feel things, while I ordinarily feel nothing.</div><div><br/></div><div>I think the sort of meeting I had with some supervisors today was the kind that would leave most people somber, but in my case none of it was a surprise and I still don&apos;t care enough about it. all I know how to do is retreat into my things and toxic fantasies.</div><div><br/></div><div>whenever the time comes, probably in no more than a month, and I do have to pack up and go, the CRC is the thing I&apos;m worried most about losing. working out has been the one good thing I&apos;ve been doing for myself.</div><div><br/></div><div>I couldn&apos;t find whatever email christian was telling me about yesterday, but he sent me a link to the six flags site and I bought a ticket for $29. a chance to &quot;recreate&quot; may 2016, if I can make it. it&apos;s tech&apos;s six flags night, so I&apos;m thinking there&apos;ll be tons of students there too.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>9-11 m</div><div><br/></div><div>last weekend I did meet up with christian at the CRC. he took forever to get there and waited until the last minute to tell me that he was bringing someone with him, &quot;[his] woman.&quot; he always has slightly odd ways of referring to whoever his partner is. she was someone different from who I was expecting, that being the woman he&apos;d brought with him to six flags last year. I don&apos;t know when they broke up, but every time he&apos;d been talking about his &quot;woman,&quot; I&apos;d always assumed it was the six flags woman. he never told me that they were no longer together and that he had a new partner. I have no idea where they could have met because I don&apos;t know anything about his personal life.</div><div><br/></div><div>his current gf is named &quot;Nicki&quot; (unsure of spelling) and she&apos;s skinnier, of average-ish height, and somewhat nerdy-looking with her glasses. she wore jeans and a hoodie and just stood behind christian and I while we did squats, watching and not joining because of some pain issues. she kept talking about those issues and almost seemed to be trying to make me uncomfortable. I didn&apos;t know what to say and had to focus on acting normal. I don&apos;t know why he brought her with him. he introduced me to her as &quot;this physical specimen.&quot; maybe he just wanted to show her that he had a hand in my workout progress.</div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday (sunday) the grocery stores were packed with people stocking up on food in preparation for the storm. all of the bread and water was gone and the lines stretched down the aisles. I tried not to think about how I was a lone shopper there amongst the crowd.</div><div><br/></div><div>I encountered the old man for the third time. this time he put forth a &quot;how&apos;re you doing&quot; or something and I just responded normally.</div><div><br/></div><div>later in the evening I went to a target and the bread and water were long gone from there too. as I was staring at the empty bread aisle, a couple turned down it and were astonished at the sight. the guy started recording with and talking into his phone, I&apos;m guessing snapchat, and I definitely ended up in frame. so whoever that got sent to saw me standing there looking at my own phone.</div><div><br/></div><div>at the checkout line, a black guy best described as inconsiderate stood behind me talking to someone on his phone on speaker. they discussed getting condoms and the repeated mentions of &quot;condoms&quot; made me think they wanted the people around them to hear them. the guy on the other end said something about wanting to fuck this asian girl again.</div><div><br/></div><div>another couple in front of me were wearing clothing that looked expensive. whether it was genuine or not, it wasn&apos;t impressive and reminded me of how I&apos;d likely be perceived whenever I go out wearing such things. it can&apos;t work as armor if it still makes me insecure.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>9-14 r</div><div><br/></div><div>there&apos;s no such thing as a birthday when you&apos;re an adult.</div><div><br/></div><div>I didn&apos;t bother telling chris when we met up at the tech square waffle house for lunch, because he&apos;s never said anything about his birthdays. I wonder if he would have offered to pay for my lunch if I did tell him. after we ate he unexpectedly proposed we go to the barnes &amp; noble. I suspect he may have had a hidden agenda, but it could just as easily be nothing. I have no idea what it could be. maybe he just wanted see what it was like inside and didn&apos;t want to be alone. who am I kidding. I went inside for what I think was the first time in years. a lot of the space once dedicated to actual books was now dominated by tech apparel. he looked at some books related to programming for a few minutes, and then we went upstairs where he looked at some standardized testing books for another few minutes. then I followed him back down to the starbucks where I got a pumpkin spice latte. I didn&apos;t like it as much now. the taste was familiar, but didn&apos;t bring back any memories.</div><div><br/></div><div>I also didn&apos;t ask him if I could tag along with him and his Nikki at six flags. if he wants to just be with her, I&apos;m not going to go. there&apos;s no way I&apos;m going to wander around that park alone.</div><div><br/></div><div>snapchat told bina and lisa that my birthday was today, so they knew. it&apos;s not bad to still be in touch with her, however slightly.</div><div><br/></div><div>I didn&apos;t bother telling &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE, either, for the same reason I didn&apos;t bother telling chris.</div><div><br/></div><div>I found out that lego released a new millennium falcon model today. in the discussion thread someone mentioned the saturn v rocket model, which I swear I remember seeing on the shelves in the store in the freehold mall. I suddenly wanted one, but they&apos;re hyped and sold out now. I drove half an hour to the nearest lego store at a mall almost 20 miles away, and when I arrived I realized that this was the mall I went to a meetup at some time last year. I talked a little bit with the two employees who were there, because I was the only customer there.</div><div><br/></div><div>I bought a slice of cake from publix and only ate half of it. I stuck a lit match into the frosting and snapped it to bina and lisa. mom and dad wished me happy birthday early, yesterday. mom told me to get myself something good to eat. brother discouraged me from buying new apple products.</div><div><br/></div><div>there&apos;re 18 minutes left. this is so stupid.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<en-note><div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-3 m</span></div><div><br/></div><div>Recently, I&apos;ve come to the realization that if I want the kind of significant change I&apos;m looking for, I&apos;m going to have to fundamentally change who I am as a person.</div><div><br/></div><div>It&apos;s always nice to wake up, initially not knowing where I am, before remembering that I&apos;m home (that last part is important).</div><div><br/></div><div>It&apos;s only slightly strange to be texting Dorothy et al. while I&apos;m up here. They&apos;d had another gathering at David&apos;s place, during which Barb apparently continued coming on to Cody. Thanks to Dorothy for the information. It&apos;s getting slightly annoying.</div><div><br/></div><div>I signed up for a whole slew of dating apps this weekend: bumble, coffee meets bagel, and hinge. Seeing up incomplete profiles. Getting the occasional like here and there (very rare).</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>the lunch today at the sichuan restaurant. I saw alice&apos;s mom there, for the first time in I don&apos;t know how many years. charles&apos;s mom too, as well as charles himself. and a couple of the other same family parents.&nbsp;<span style="-en-paragraph:true;">charles&apos;s mom was ecstatic to see me, and over the moon when she saw that we&apos;d brought her stuffed dolphin.&nbsp;<span style="-en-paragraph:true;">charles himself was exactly the same as he&apos;d always been. he brought a pink ipad and was doing stuff on it the whole time. we never exchanged a word.</span></span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="-en-paragraph:true;"><span style="-en-paragraph:true;">what was interesting was that afterwards,&nbsp;<span style="-en-paragraph:true;">alice&apos;s mom kept inquiring about a girlfriend, if I had one. apparently alice had told her something about a girl I was interested in? after discussing it a bit with my mom, I came to the conclusion that she (alice) had simply related to her mom outdated information.</span></span></span></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="-en-paragraph:true;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-5 w</span></span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>september is the sneakiest month, the one that creeps up and pounces out of nowhere the most.</div><div><br/></div><div>Dorothy has still been pushing for me to connect with the Jill, whose real name apparently is Yims. she friended Dorothy, and after some consideration, I followed her suggestion and friended Yims. but that&apos;s all so far. I finally changed my facebook profile picture to one of my actual self.</div><div><br/></div><div>the Fabian likes to sit in his car in the parking garage and browse stuff on his phone. twice now I&apos;ve ended up parking right next to him. the JP never makes eye contact with me when we walk past each other.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-7 f</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>as of now, the core group has collapsed to just me, cody, Dorothy, and Heather. and their views, especially Dorothy&apos;s, are having significant influence on the way I&apos;m viewing the others remaining in the original run/wine/dine group. particularly towards David and Barb. for the first time yesterday, I could see David&apos;s want for attention shining through. he seemed to get sulky whenever we weren&apos;t talking to him about something he wanted to discuss. from the moment he arrived at the restaurant, for some reason, I almost felt like he didn&apos;t belong there with us. his birthday is three days after mine.</div><div><br/></div><div>the food was alright. I shared a mooncake with the rest of them. cody might have lost interest in the dragon boat event tomorrow. Dorothy still wants me to get to know Yims. after tricking David into leaving, the rest of us stood in the parking lot to freely gossip for what felt like an hour. I&apos;m getting rather bored of the endless talk about Barb. at least I&apos;m not the only one who&apos;s over Dorothy&apos;s habit of repeating things; Heather coyly commented on it as well and we kept looking at each other every time Dorothy said something she&apos;d already said multiple times in this sitting. Jay&apos;s status within our group was further downgraded. how good is it really that I&apos;m apparently within this inner circle?</div><div><br/></div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-8 s</span></div><div><br/></div><div>the day began at 5:30 when I woke up before the alarm I set.</div><div><br/></div><div>driving in the dark, just before twilight hit. I hadn&apos;t driven during this time of day in a long while. Cody agreed that it was a nice time to drive, after we had set off in the car with Dorothy, David, and the Li, who was already at Dorothy&apos;s house by the time I got there. we got breakfast at a McDonald&apos;s before getting on the highway. Cody pointed out the area where his parents lived when we passed through it. David kept launching into his monologues during the last leg of the trip.</div><div><br/></div><div>it was the first time I revisited lake Lanier, and it was a different area from where I was three years ago. we found the tap tent and I felt at ease adapting to the unfamiliar environment because I had the others with me. the first dragon boat race began shortly after we arrived. not going into the needless details about the race. it was surprisingly fun, and we did rather well for a team half of whose members had never rowed a boat like this before. after the race, we walked around the other tents and food selling ones. I got a tattoo of a dragon head and tried getting a good photo of me with it taken. I wasn&apos;t satisfied with my facial expression in any of the ones I asked Cody and Dorothy to take, but I didn&apos;t want to keep asking.</div><div><br/></div><div>I think lunch was after the second race, in which we beat or first time by about half a second. in the tent next to the tap one was someone who I think was Kelly Huang. I wasn&apos;t sure because of how small she was and kept looking to confirm. we performed the best in our third race; by then everyone had gotten the rowing technique down for the most part, and we were much more in sync as well. despite that, it was our slowest time, but everyone was still excited afterwards and I think we placed fairly close to the front. after that, we left.</div><div><br/></div><div>throughout the day, I kept looking at the Jennifer Kwon, who didn&apos;t appear to remember me from three previous thursday. I never talked to her or any of the other cute girls I saw there and ended up sticking closely to Dorothy et al. Dorothy mentioned afterwards that she&apos;d noticed a wedding band on the Jen&apos;s wrist? which I never saw. the Li didn&apos;t partake in the rowing, but took plenty of photos and video of us.</div><div><br/></div><div>Dorothy was all about coming up with a story as to why we were at the dragon boat festival without the rest of them before showing up to Barb&apos;s &quot;party.&quot; Jay was the only one there when we showed up some two hours or so after the posted start time. unbeknownst to me previously, Barb had moved to another apartment, one in the very complex that Cody and I got lost in a couple weeks ago while looking for the hiking trail. I swear as soon as we got there, he and Barb separated from the rest of us to talk. she had made some food and drinks, and was wearing the skimpy red bikini I&apos;d heard so much about. it was extremely revealing and left next to nothing to the imagination. Dorothy arrived separately with Li and I quickly grew bored. there were two separate pools, one with a small waterfall thing, and Cody / Barb fucked off underneath it themselves, leaving the rest of us with nothing to do. I myself did NOT want to stay there, and Dorothy made an excuse for me to leave with her and Li (although the excuse was quite transparent).</div><div><br/></div><div>as I said on the way to the perimeter mall, Cody&apos;s collapse has begun. he&apos;s told me that his online dating ventures so far have yielded nothing, so that, combined with Barb&apos;s continuous, increasingly strong advances, may finally be wearing him down. for the first time, I noticed his actions not aligning with his words. Dorothy was intense unfiltered, and we were on the same page regarding the situation as it stands now; I don&apos;t care if they hook up or not, but I have no intention of sitting around at a &quot;party&quot; watching it happen. I&apos;m currently sitting in Dorothy&apos;s apartment with her and Li typing this out. now I&apos;m going to have to go back there to fetch Cody and David because I drove them there.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>when I got there they were still at the pool, and had apparently gone to Barb&apos;s place and back because there was a hookah sitting in the table, as well as a new unrecognized person chatting animatedly with David (turns out his name was also David and he is a super intelligent hyper nerd). I didn&apos;t sit down, and surprisingly David was the first to ask if I wanted to leave. Cody sounded like he was slightly drunk, and he could tell I wanted to go too. I wasn&apos;t exactly trying to hide it. we packed everything up into Barb&apos;s car and she hugged us. I apologized for not staying long. she seemed fine with everything, so maybe she got what she wanted out of Cody. I wonder if she&apos;s going to bed any sad at all.</div><div><br/></div></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-9 n</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>I think I&apos;m developing a crush on that Jen. this was harder to admit than I thought. those small stirrings that came every time I glanced at her yesterday were feelings I had forgotten I could feel. her eyes are kind of bird-like, they remind me of rachel amber&apos;s from life is strange.</div><div><br/></div><div>they mentioned yesterday that Jay probably has FOMO and that he looked a little antsy or something while we were at the pool talking about the dragon boat event. if this is true, I know how that feels. I know the feeling of being excluded from something. now I see the feeling striking someone else, and I don&apos;t care. I&apos;m just glad it isn&apos;t me this time.</div><div><br/></div><div>I was the last to leave dorothy&apos;s house after watching &apos;a quiet place&apos; last night. after Li and David left, I was &quot;stuck&quot; with her as we talked for more minutes about cody and Barb. this morning she followed up with me on plans for our &quot;photoshoot&quot;. I guess it&apos;s turning into a thing, because said plans are currently set for me to meet up with her later for a hike and probably dinner or something.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-10 m</span></div><div><br/></div><div>the past always feels like a simpler time. why can&apos;t the present feel that way too?</div><div><br/></div><div>I think my personal traditional trips home will have to end. the summer trip has already been done away with this year.</div><div><br/></div><div>the &quot;photoshoot&quot; with dorothy actually happened yesterday. I think I wasn&apos;t really expecting it to because I wasn&apos;t fully committed, but dorothy was, pleasantly surprisingly. I felt like I was outside my body as I drove myself to her place, wearing my button-down, pants, and lanvin sneakers. as she had told me, dorothy was wearing a dress. I really didn&apos;t know what to expect from this photoshoot. when she said, &quot;I guess I&apos;ll drive...?&quot; it kind of felt like she was expecting me to offer (think asker vs guesser) and I had sort of already decided myself that I would be driving, so I took us to the vickery creek trail.</div><div><br/></div><div>I was uncomfortable getting pictures taken of me. I didn&apos;t like how forced I felt, it was too hot outside, I felt self-conscious. but it was a rather popular spot, and many other people were there for the same reason, some with professional photographers. dorothy still got some shots of me that I was actually satisfied with. but it was still a relief to change into casual/active clothes to hike in. it was ~3.5 miles or so, and along the way we easily talked. I learned that, like me, dorothy is a late bloomer too. she told me that it&apos;s okay to not date around at this time in my life. I still feel like she sees things a little differently from how I do, but I&apos;m also starting to believe that she can relate to me too.</div><div><br/></div><div>oddly enough, things afterwards went exactly as I had envisioned. we decided to eat dinner at the same restaurant as last time, roux. so on the way we drove by the little plaza by the gas station where I had met Kat, nearly 3.5 years ago. here she focused some more of her attention on me, and I relayed some more to her about what I&apos;d like in a girl. I told her that like the Jennifer Kwon, her eyes and freckles, her personality. Hannah&apos;s my type. the Li (Wang) friended me on facebook, and so did petunia. I showed dorothy how to rearrange her iphone&apos;s app icons, and how to use touch id. on the way back to her place, we discussed inviting Li and Yims to dinner with us at a hole-in-the-wall chinese place that has good soup dumplings, as well as who else to invite (notably deciding to exclude Jay).</div><div><br/></div><div>there&apos;s no course of action I need to take that isn&apos;t going to feel uncomfortable. dorothy suggests that I start easy and ask out Yims, for practice if nothing else. I&apos;m just worried that nothing I can try with her will be genuine enough, since I&apos;m not truly interested in her. her dress and backpack had really &quot;knocked her down a few points.&quot; it was more noticeable here than anywhere I&apos;d seen before, how much this first impression matters. dorothy described Yims as matronly, which wraps it up quite nicely, and was off-putting as well.</div><div><br/></div><div>I hung out some more at dorothy&apos;s place with just her. she turned on her tv, that she likes watching dateline and reality shows on, and the loud droning made me tired. I watched some of miss america and made fun of the contestants.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-11 t</span></div><div><br/></div><div>Zach effectively bought me lunch yesterday, and he was very insistent that I pay him back as soon as possible, even messaging me last night, insisting on cash. I had to pay him back two extra dollars because I didn&apos;t the bills for exactly eight. it wouldn&apos;t be surprising if he never gets back to me about the extra two. I may never say anything about it to see if he does. as I was getting up to leave this afternoon, I noticed that he reacted more quickly than usual, and sure enough he asked for the cash again, apparently having forgotten that I had already given it to him earlier.</div><div><br/></div><div>the Gorm today notably asked me &quot;how&apos;s it going&quot; as in, in general. and I took the opportunity to let slip a little that I&apos;m not happy working on tp2 code.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-14 f</span></div><div><br/></div><div>this is the next birthday post.</div><div><br/></div><div>it may be the first birthday in four years that I don&apos;t spend alone. current plans are to meet with dorothy, cody, Li, and Yims for soup dumplings. how will this go?</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>uneventfully.</div><div><br/></div><div>we ate dinner, we talked, we left. some points:</div><div>* cody and dorothy totally underestimate my chinese speaking level. but I never spoke to any of the waiters in front of them to disprove them.</div><div>* cody thought that I had left Barb&apos;s party because of another &quot;attack&quot;</div><div>* Yims has never met David but that didn&apos;t stop dorothy from telling her about him. and the conversation that they had yesterday after their joint run. David opening up to her? about his desire for &quot;animalistic sex&quot; as he had apparently put it, and it gets exposed to all of us, even to people he&apos;s never met.</div><div>* I was hoping that someone would cover dinner for me, but that didn&apos;t happen. how can I express this disappointment without it becoming a talking point?</div><div>* Yims quietly prayed before eating.</div><div>* Li didn&apos;t find out that it was my birthday until after we left the restaurant, and Yims didn&apos;t find out until we were sitting at mango mango. dorothy told them I didn&apos;t want to make a big deal out of it, but I didn&apos;t feel that that was true. nevertheless, I wouldn&apos;t know how that fact could come up naturally.</div><div>* I couldn&apos;t share dorothy&apos;s excitement over all the different dessert choices at mango mango.</div><div>* Yims reached over and patted my arm once while we were talking about something.</div><div>* we continued to talk about David, and so I learned some more about him. is any of it even worth recording at all?</div><div><br/></div><div>I never felt any kind of connection with Yims. Li seemed to think that we were getting along, but cody and dorothy noticed that I didn&apos;t really talk to her. I don&apos;t see anything. at the same time, maybe I never communicated clearly enough that I wasn&apos;t attracted to her to begin with. actually, I felt more comfortable with Li than I felt with Yims both times. she even said (again) that she has &quot;options&quot; for me, showing a picture on her phone of someone named Julia.</div><div><br/></div><div>so &lt;PROSTEAK&gt; DOOGIE has been using dating apps too. he told me that he still has &quot;no hits&quot;.</div><div><br/></div><div>I reached out to Hannah yesterday, and she told me that she had recently been in TWO motorcycle wrecks, at least one of which hurt her legs pretty badly. she showed me a picture and they were missing a lot of skin. she hadn&apos;t told me about them previously.</div><div><br/></div><div>Nita also wished me a happy birthday and offered to take me out to lunch later. sorry if I&apos;m being cynical, but I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if that never happens. we&apos;ve hardly hung out this year at all. I have to say that I&apos;m surprised only two people wrote on my facebook wall for my birthday.</div><div><br/></div><div>cody&apos;s booked his trip to europe in early october.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-15 s</span></div><div><br/></div><div>there is such a wide gap between my mindsets in imagination and reality.</div><div><br/></div><div>that Diana was present at the run meetup again today, but I still didn&apos;t talk to her, other than asking if I could sit in her chair with her stuff on it. I felt cody would have been observing. although if that&apos;s true, then he would have seen me behave as I did anyway. and maybe tell dorothy about it. I didn&apos;t feel like talking much during or afterwards. I felt myself sinking again.</div><div><br/></div><div>~</div><div><br/></div><div>there was another big bjj tournament today so there was no one there for me at the bangkok gym when I went. I&apos;d completely forgotten about it. I&apos;m not blaming her for anything, but Hannah never told or reminded me, and also never asked if I was going.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-16 n</span></div><div><br/></div><div>I&apos;ve had the messenger group chat muted for the several days, so I was surprised to open it today and see that Jay had said we should celebrate my birthday. Barb continued to push for margs. I said I concurred, but they pushed the organization on to me, which I wasn&apos;t prepared for for some reason. David&apos;s birthday is tomorrow, so we could potentially Celebrate the birthdays simultaneously, although I don&apos;t know if I&apos;d enjoy that.</div><div><br/></div><div>today I had a pho dinner with cody and dorothy. dorothy arrived late, which frustrated cody. we discussed many things but the important topic to me was Yims&apos; personality and what I should do moving forward. dorothy reaffirmed that I should use the opportunity to practice talking. I realized that for some reason I had yet again dismissed the possibility of at least keeping her as a friend or something. like just because we wouldn&apos;t be compatible, that there&apos;d be nothing left. I don&apos;t know why I do this.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-17 m</span></div><div><br/></div><div>it&apos;s been some three and a half months since matching with the Karen on tinder in san francisco, and we&apos;re still kind of talking. there&apos;ve been some slowdowns, but she still gets back to me. I don&apos;t even think she&apos;s THAT cute. perhaps she doesn&apos;t have much else going on in that app either. when I mentioned that I could&apos;ve been in san francisco again (with the small bunch of coworkers who are there now), she even said that we could have gotten food.</div><div><br/></div><div>I talked briefly with someone on coffee meets bagel, but only about bjj and then it just came to a halt.</div><div><br/></div><div>so apparently the Anthony, whose birthday that I had forgotten was yesterday, turned 40. one day older than David. what are the differences between the two of them?</div><div><br/></div><div>I mentioned my new tom ford glasses frame to petunia and how I&apos;d bought a heat gun from home depot to adjust them, and he said that I could simply have taken them to him. I&apos;d completely forgotten that he works with eyewear. he offered and insisted that I go see him to get them adjusted. professionally, I guess.</div><div><br/></div><div>cody cheekily referred back to David&apos;s &quot;animalistic sexual urges&quot; in our text thread today, when dorothy and I were talking about something completely unrelated. as I think about it now, I believe that David&apos;s and my feelings overlap a little bit. I can sort of understand how he feels about these things? and he&apos;s trying to tell others how he&apos;s feeling by bringing up his desires in a forced nonchalant way. and we&apos;re making fun of him behind his back and trivializing his feelings.</div><div><br/></div><div>I doubt that I&apos;m exempt from dorothy&apos;s behind-the-back gossip. sometimes I wonder what she might be saying about me. but I shouldn&apos;t worry. in fact, I might be more hurt if it turns out she doesn&apos;t do that with me.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-18</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">t</span></div><div><br/></div><div>today I met the Martin at work. I wasn&apos;t expecting him to be so tall. and in shape. I can see what Anthony meant when he described him as a &quot;hyper-nerd&quot;. he was in fact using almost nothing but command line interfaces.</div><div><br/></div><div>this second Mixer went pretty much exactly as expected, I think. it was much more crowded than the first one. once again I found myself stuck in the same space. Li was there, and she caught me off guard with her...guidance. I definitely followed her around too much, but it was all I knew to do. asking me if I wanted to do this or that. bringing me water. introducing me to people for me. I had a few prototypical introductory conversations with new people. almost no one seemed to be a true integrated member of either organization (TAP or NAAAP).</div><div><br/></div><div>Yims arrived next, and I saw her standing by herself as I was eating my food, pretending not to notice her. I kept looking for/at the Jennifer again, who was effortlessly talking with seemingly every other person there. she&apos;s still handsy. and encouraging...? me to sit down at the table. next to Yims, and across from the girl who was dorothy&apos;s rowing partner at the dragon boat event, and another bubbly girl whose name I forgot. I told Yims that I liked the print on her dress. when I fell out of the conversations I went back to Li. the women she was talking with were even more boring, so I went back to the table again. one of the guys there, a Vinson, acquiesced to the girls&apos; requests to show off his breakdancing routine. you could tell he wasn&apos;t 100% comfortable, but he wasn&apos;t terribly awkward either.</div><div><br/></div><div>David and dorothy didn&apos;t arrive until nearly half past nine. most of the people had trickled out by then. the Justine handed her phone around to gather everyone on facebook, including me. David made a point to say hi to me. he looked sad. dorothy asked me a bit more about my preferences. I didn&apos;t partake in most of the ensuing philosophical discussion about dealing with people of different religions and races. somehow the tide turned to horror movies, and I eagerly supported dorothy&apos;s proposition to host another horror movie night. she also asked if I noticed the Jen&apos;s wedding/engagement band this time, which I hadn&apos;t. I&apos;m somewhat glad that that&apos;s the case, honestly, because it makes it easier for me.</div><div><br/></div><div>Yims had left earlier and dorothy perceived her response to a photo of our table that I sent to the messenger group as flirtatious. I didn&apos;t see it. but I keep forgetting to NOT discount the possibility of remaining friendly with her.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-22 s</span></div><div><br/></div><div>paranoid: petunia somehow hiding a tracking device within my glasses frame when he went into a back room to adjust them for me. intentionally messing them up so that he&apos;d have to order that new frame, so that I&apos;d have to come back. or maybe he did just mean well and wanted to help me out, although I was super meticulous and immediately noticed several flaws, such as the decorative shiny bar being misaligned and marks on the arms where he had dug his nails in while adjusting them. he was somewhat adamant about me coming to him, must have really wanted to see me again. for some reason, I had to stifle my smiles around him. why is that happening around him? I wonder what I would think of him if I&apos;d only ever met him in his work environment.</div><div><br/></div><div>I took an &quot;initiative&quot; and sat next to the Diana at jason&apos;s deli after the run, leaving cody with the Tom because I didn&apos;t feel like sitting there silently listening to him talk about his europe plans yet again. do I just not work with some people, or am I still too fragile? &apos;inauthentic&apos; isn&apos;t the right word to describe her, she&apos;s just...too much like me and that makes it so much harder for me to lead.</div><div><br/></div><div>Jacob made a bit of small talk with me today. I said that although my attendance has been spotty, I don&apos;t have any plans to drop the activity. no, I don&apos;t plan on watching the Mallory&apos;s fight tonight.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-24 m</span></div><div><br/></div><div>my past journal entries continue to surprise me with how far back some of my thought patterns have been running since. maybe whenever I reread this, I&apos;ll still be thinking the same thing.</div><div><br/></div><div>last night someone actually not only matched with me on hinge, which I&apos;d forgotten about, but also messaged me first. her name is Melissa, and when I first glanced at the notification, I thought for a fraction of a second that it was about melissa wang.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-25 t</span></div><div><br/></div><div>trudging through the sludge at work that is tp2. I gave up debugging this afternoon, and I was leaving the office Anthony said we&apos;ll just continue working on this tomorrow. I felt strangely comfortable. I was leaving to make the hour-long drive through traffic all the way to scissorhands again for a haircut. it&apos;s amazing how resistant I am to change; it&apos;s been months since cody told me about the salon he goes to, that&apos;s much closer and would save me so much time. yet I still choose the one twenty miles away. the place was empty today and the guy cutting my hair was the same one as last time. he remembered me.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-26 w</span></div><div><br/></div><div>minor cathartic release as I overheard Anthony and Danny discussing the Kumar&apos;s atrocious code, after Anthony saw a little more of it himself while working on it with me. then a slightly strange evening at three dollar cafe, where we three made up the only trivia team there. they, especially Anthony, kept pushing for me to join them at their eleventh street pub again. even telling them that I wouldn&apos;t have to worry about any consequences for showing up late to work the next morning. despite Anthony&apos;s promises of vagina, I declined their invitation and went home myself after dropping them off there. although I always do wonder what could have happened had I stayed. it&apos;s always nothing when I do.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">9-28 f</span></div></div><div><br/></div><div>yesterday I had no problem going out to lunch with the Danny, Anthony, Blessed, and Richard. a crowd I normally don&apos;t hang out with. Richard forced me twice to sit in between two other people, once in the car and once in the restaurant. he referred to it as &quot;riding bitch&quot;. I felt angry and annoyed when he &quot;forced&quot; me into the middle position. it&apos;s more of a reflection of me than him. I paid attention to the way I was taking his shit vs Blessed and the others. I was allowing it to get to me too much. in this case I didn&apos;t care because no one was watching, but if someone else were? it would have been total collapse, and my own fault. that&apos;s an instance of me *allowing* someone to walk over me.</div><div><br/></div><div>Anthony is aware of my reddit activity because he always sees me on it whenever he walks past my desk. today I had left a r/ForeverAlone tab open when he approached, and sort of hastily scrolled down on the page so that the r/ForeverAlone text wouldn&apos;t be visible. I wonder if he could tell that I was trying to hide something. I don&apos;t know if he saw it. or if he would tell anyone, had he seen it. I genuinely don&apos;t care. he&apos;s suggested a few times that I rewrite the rba code I&apos;ve been working with, though I&apos;m not sure if he was saying so in jest. I&apos;m losing my patience with the code and have monologued to myself in my head countless times, but have never worked up the nerve to say anything to the Blessed or Gorm.</div><div><br/></div><div>I messaged Hannah one more time, and again she asked me how I&apos;ve been and said that we should Catch Up. didn&apos;t seem interested in chatting. oh well.</div><div><br/></div><div>today I added Ben on steam.</div><div><br/></div><div>dorothy messaged the facebook group asking if anyone would be interested in a marathon relay in new jersey next april. I googled the location and it was about 30-35 minutes from my house. maybe we were just throwing things out there, but I said we could go six flags afterwards, and dorothy even suggested driving if no one wanted to fly. if we can find two other people willing to go, and actually do this together, it would be a dream come true. and if they actually come stay at home...!</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div><b>9-30 n</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>jason&apos;s deli wouldn&apos;t open for us, the run group, yesterday morning, so they fucked off to einstein&apos;s instead. or so they said. when I went over there with cody, there were only four of them there, none of whom I recognized. so we went to eat at the flying biscuit. I wondered what the Diana, who I ran by at the same spot in the park as I did last week, made of the situation when she saw that no one was at jason&apos;s. get in her car and leave by herself?</div><div><br/></div><div>while we waited to be sat at the flying biscuit, cody told me about money getting stolen from his car after he got it washed at the car wash place that&apos;s near ponce city market. I kept agreeing that it sucked, but didn&apos;t have much else to offer. I think I would&apos;ve felt badly if I were the one venting about my misfortune and he reacted the way I did. I felt that diving into how shitty people can be when no one&apos;s looking would have been an old topic. maybe I should have just said it.</div><div><br/></div><div>while at the table waiting for our food, we were able to observe a couple people get their cars booted in the small parking lot next to us. cody seemed to find it entertaining, and I understand that feeling, but I didn&apos;t like the idea of reveling in other peoples&apos; misfortune, especially when I have no idea how much they might deserve it or not. cody also told me a bit about the several matches he suddenly got on bumble within a short time frame. I showed him that I had zero on mine, and he laughed out loud, seemingly because he was that taken aback. although the differences between us here weren&apos;t surprising, it still felt slightly shitty and I didn&apos;t want that to show too much. but I was okay with potentially making it known to him.</div><div><br/></div><div>the food and service at the restaurant were terrible and I wasn&apos;t sure if I&apos;d have enough willpower to make it to bjj. turns out I did, and the Mallory turned into the parking lot behind me. we continued to not make eye contact or talk to each other. I typically have the most fulfilling time rolling with the Phil, because he knows a few more tactics than me, which gives me a chance to defend against them. the Dana is closer to my level. I watched the Phil roll with Jacob, and I would have liked to get an extra round in myself, but I&apos;d already changed out of my gi and wasn&apos;t about to change my mind.</div><div><br/></div><div>knowing that I was able to push through to bjj allowed me to enjoy the rest of the day a little more. I set out for dorothy&apos;s house after picking up more raspberry sours at kroger, and arrived at the same time as the dude Tuan, who randomly showed up even though he wasn&apos;t in the messenger group. Barb gave me a hug, and I responded with, &quot;nice to see you.&quot; I still get slightly anxious when I&apos;m talking to her for some reason.</div><div><br/></div><div>I spent most of the time at the dinner table floating around dorothy and cody, instead of with Barb, the Tuan, Li, and Tia, who I thought looked kind of hot this time. we got caught up in another discussion about David, referring to him as his instagram username. we made the usual mistake of preparing way too much food. dorothy heated one of the packs of hot dogs that I&apos;d bought, but not one was eaten that night.</div><div><br/></div><div>I was afraid that we&apos;d be the audience again to cody and Barb cuddling during the movie, but cody seemed to deliberately position himself in a corner where no one else would be able to fit in with him, to avoid her. I was able to mirror my phone&apos;s screen on dorothy&apos;s apple tv, and rented &apos;the ring&apos; from youtube for us to watch. it was exciting to watch a scary movie in the dark with a group of people, but the Tuan was pissing me off to no end. so much that&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a monologue prepared; he was constantly announcing what was about to happen, pointing out details before anyone had the chance to notice them themselves, and quoting dialogue before it was spoken. we get it, you&apos;ve seen the movie, just shut the fuck up! meanwhile cody tried his hand at diffusing tension by making obnoxious comments about &quot;atldaveed&quot;.</div><div><br/></div><div>after the movie ended I put on cinemasins&apos; &apos;eww the ring&apos; video for everyone to watch, and I guess I was satisfied with how funny the rest of them found it. Barb was open to me selecting another movie for a next time. I noticed her leaving with cody, and although I left a few minutes after them, they were only just driving past my parked car when I got there.</div><div><br/></div><div>this morning there was a sort of afterparty...? at dorothy&apos;s again. this time Jay was there, and Barb again also. I just want to mention our talking about Yims again. Barb hasn&apos;t met her, so dorothy gleefully jumped into a description. this girl, who Barb hasn&apos;t ever met, is being gossiped about, unbeknownst to her. I had to reiterate that it wasn&apos;t a single particular trait about Yims that turned me off, just that I&apos;m not compatible with her overall. her backpack, her dress, her religion. Barb said that I&apos;m a sharp dresser. not going to lie, that was a bit of an ego boost. moments before David arrived, Barb admitted that she had a bit of an anxiety attack one time when she was alone with him. according to her, he had basically slut-shamed her. I feel like I&apos;ve heard David deny that or a similar claim, so I&apos;m not entirely sure who to believe. but I&apos;m leaning towards Barb, just because.</div><div><br/></div><div>dorothy was actually willing to sit down for another horror movie? but she had to be somewhere by a certain time, so we couldn&apos;t fit a whole movie in. instead Jay streamed a show called &apos;the good place&apos; from netflix, which I found entertaining, but might not continue on my own.</div><div><br/></div><div>I haven&apos;t yet recorded anything about the Amy that I matched with on cmb. I&apos;ve had several slow, excruciating conversations with other people, but this one was the most natural so far. when it came to asking her out, I simply said the first thing that came to mind, and I think she accepted...there&apos;s no definite time set so far, but something could happen late next week. I hadn&apos;t responded to her last messages for a day, and as I was using the app today, she sent me another message wishing me a good rest of weekend. my mind has been getting ahead of myself all day.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>

<!DOCTYPE en-note SYSTEM "http://xml.evernote.com/pub/enml2.dtd">
<en-note style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space;"><div>I think it's because of my new 8-hour workday that's making the week pass by so slowly. Today was only Wednesday. My boss (manager? supervisor?) caught me playing Minesweeper in my cubicle and he had a discussion with me that left a bad taste in my mouth. &quot;Work&quot; so far has been about on par with what I had expected, in terms of bore. It seems more miserable as I think about it, that my life is doomed to become more and more dull from this point on. I'm adamant that I want to do something about it, but haven't the slightest clue what. I will be needing the radio to keep myself sane, tuning in only to 106.7, listening to Rich Kaminski in the morning and Delilah at night. They often mention commuting and coming home from work, or going to work, and families. It calms me. This daily misery is completely normal, they tell me. I'm experiencing my usual new people issues with co-workers, primarily the ones I've been eating lunch with. The ones I recognize barely make eye contact with me when I pass them. The ones I don't, who are also mostly older, smile. Those closer to my age don't seem very happy. I acted a little bit silly in front of the Jeff today and he said &quot;What the fuck.&quot; Being my eccentric self still feels unnatural. I feel like I've been here forever when it's only been a mere 3 days. I might lose my mind by the end of the summer. I don't care if I end up making no friends, and I'm ready to go it all alone.
<div><br/><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
5-19 n</div><div><br/></div><div>As always, the trouble with skipping writing days is that the thoughts in my head become condensed and eventually fizz out. Much like dreams. Which, also as always, are what Tech and the workplace both feel like as soon as I leave them. I wish I wasn't this NUMB.</div><div><br/></div><div>I don't think of my co-workers as friends, future friends, or potential friends. I don't know if that will change. It likely will. I'll just wait and see.</div><div><br/></div><div>Anjaly doesn't really answer my texts and I'm always backing out of retrying. How many times can I try to talk with someone who clearly has no interest in me? Maybe I will cry to Asta about it. And about Jessie, too. I actually considered asking Zora. That must mean I'm really desperate. But seeing as I have no friends here at home with me, I could need her too.</div><div><br/></div><div>When we had guests over this weekend, I would constantly retreat into the study, to my computer where some 9-year-old began to annoy me. Further destroying any hope I had of becoming better at interacting with kids. My dad encouraged me to have a beer, which my mother was firmly against, of course, but I had a sip only because I wanted to remember what it tasted like.</div><div><br/></div><div>When my thoughts turn to ACF now, they're bleak. I've run out of time to become good, close friends with Steph, Mo, and the like, and any freshmen. I'm not going to meet anyone new. That best I can hope for now is to try again in some brand new setting, either a work environment, or a new school, if I land in one. I'll be older by then. It makes [me] very, very sad.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
5-20 m</div><div><br/></div><div>It's past midnight, so it's technically my mother's birthday right now. Lisa answered a post I put up on Tumblr asking what to do for my mother's birthday. Also, Lisa is one of the two people she said may have liked me at some point. The other is Asta, but I know that one. A third possibility she never knew about is Melanie, and a fourth is, of course, Jessie. Lisa had driven me to school from the airport, told me randomly one night that she was on her period, and has asked to hang out multiple times. I wonder if any of those moments could meant something.</div><div><br/></div><div>Anjaly answered my text from last week. We didn't get far. I still fantasize about her. Jessie too.</div><div><br/></div><div>Haven't talked to anyone from school.</div><div><br/></div><div>I miss the walks that Tom and I used to take.</div><div><br/></div><div>Thinking back to summer of 2008: &quot;Her name is Morgan. I held her hand once.&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
5-22 w</div><div><br/></div><div>I'm going to pretend it's yesterday for a moment:</div><div><br/></div><div>I bought a birthday card for my mom after work. Didn't spend a lot of time picking one out. Still, it made her happy. Too bad I'm not one of the real caring kids, who put a lot more time and effort into a day like this. Dad bought her chocolate. It's still unopened on the kitchen counter.</div><div><br/></div><div>I've been wanting to write about this for several days. Sometimes in the mornings I drive by some teens standing in their driveways. They must be waiting for their school buses, I was once one of them, but I drive to work now.</div><div><br/></div><div>I'm beginning to think of Jessie and Anjaly as targets. Potential matches. Just my imagination running astray.</div><div><br/></div><div>I don't know why Diana invited me to a Google Hangout at 1:35 am. Maybe it was an accident.</div><div><br/></div><div>There isn't much of work to talk about. I'm going to started on some real stuff soon. Kind of excited. Not terribly worried, or stressed out. Not yet.</div><div><br/></div><div>Not missing Atlanta. As usual. So unusual, too.</div><div><br/></div><div>blah, blah</div><div><br/></div><div>I seriously have to work on my casual conversation, and also being able to call out to someone, addressing them by name. This shouldn't be so difficult.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
5-28 t</div><div><br/></div><div>I really don't have much to say now, but I just don't want to break my newest habit.</div><div><ul><li>I feel like giving up completely on Anjaly again. Asta, too.</li><li>I've been daydreaming and fantasizing about Jessie a LOT.</li><li>And I can't see myself ever considering or thinking of my co-workers as friends.</li></ul></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
5-29 w</div><div><br/></div><div>Simple lines from a Tumblr blog I've been reading, unwrittenspokenwords, have me rethinking again. And re-realizing that i still am waiting for life-changing moments and other things that must be made. And I still seek satisfaction in materials.</div><div><br/></div><div>I tend to agree with sentiments expressing the idea that HEAVEN is just as much a waste of time as all of the other phantoms we chase for our whole lives.</div><div><br/></div><div>I let Tom drive me today. instead of taking the BMW over to his house. First we ate dinner. I was worried about the oh-no-we-are-strangers-again feeling, but it wasn't very bad. We didn't talk about high school quite as much this time. I didn't ask him a lot about Amy, and a lot of times I still left my thoughts and responses unvoiced. I didn't answer any of the good-byes he called out through his window as he drove away. We should hang out several more times, though, so I need to change and update my behavior. Gives me hope.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>I think I'm getting tired, and I just want to go to bed. I'm not happy now, but not drastically unhappy. I'll just explain it tomorrow.</div><div><hr/>
Two days later</div><div><br/></div><div>It was because my boss had called up my dad two nights ago and, according to my dad, given him (dad) &quot;shit&quot; about me and my voice being too low and not being able to understand me during a group meeting. I didn't think of it as that big a deal, because I've been hearing that for as long as I can remember. Dad on the other hand, has sent me several emails regarding voice volume and was so affected by Dale's tirade that he approached me about it this morning and asked me to work together with him to resolve this. He used the word &quot;shit&quot; a total of four times and said twice that it hurt his heart. I've just about never seen him like this. I agreed to attend some weekly public speaking program with him, where I anticipate hiding in my shell for as long as I can from anyone I meet there.</div><div><br/></div><div>I find talking with my cubemate Jeff to be exhausting, and that's even with our longest conversation lasting about three minutes. I can't keep running away from this. I've been thinking that ACF will be my breath of fresh air, but it's probably just the comfort that I once found there. Or the fact that those people live by VALUES that they uphold.</div><div><br/></div><div>One more thing that pissed me off slightly: Amy commented on a picture I posted to Tom, jokingly asking I'm &quot;stealing&quot; him all the time. Now there are many, many photos of the two of them hanging out and eating together, indicating that they spend a lot of time with each other. I've hung out with [him] twice in six months, and rarely ever hang out with anyone at all, and she has the audacity to &quot;get upset&quot; with me for &quot;stealing&quot; Tom for three hours.</div><div><br/></div><div>This also applies to Lisa and Christine, from a nighttime homework session at least 1.5 years ago.</div></div></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>not until the 6th of June</div><div><br/></div><div>This morning I tried Facebooking, specifically Yan. I also was simultaneously relieved and saddened by Jessie's not answering me on Skype, I said I would try her again, but still haven't. I think about Monique in India. What will I ask when I next see her? Tell me about India? So another deeply saddening thing, that I have absolutely no idea what to say to people I so badly want to talk to.</div><div><br/></div><div>I think about people so far away from me, and hopelessly wonder if they ever think about me too, even if it's deridingly or for the same reason.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>6-7</div><div><br/></div><div>I know it means nothing, but Marleah spoke to me today. I was preparing to simply mutter a Hi and march past her - if necessary. But she noted my absence at &quot;First Friday Sushi&quot; and I just said that I don't really like sushi. Also she liked my shirt. I took too long preparing a response. Hours later, after I got home, I thought of some things I could have said. As I monitor my own interactions, I'm becoming increasingly frustrated with all of this socializing ability that I'm lacking. My mom is looking for a psychologist. For me.</div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>6-11</div><div><br/></div><div>I can see it in myself everyday now, my increasingly debilitating social ineptitude. Now I worry that when I also see signs of it in other people, it's only when they're around me. I was peeking at my cube-mate's computer screen and he was writing an email to someone about giving them a recommendation letter. Someone wouldn't ask him for such a thing if he wasn't very competent. I don't even get many chances, which is sad, but I am constantly analyzing myself in my interactions and conversations with people, and am always disappointed with what I deliver. I think I should get myself to practice with them, perhaps prepare some greeting or other phrase beforehand to say to them. Can't be too healthy feeling perpetually disgusted with what incoherent grumble my weak voice ends up spitting out. I don't want to be like Jeff (both of them) or that John Reed, or Kevin...but right now I'm far worse. Mom says she has talked to some psychiatrist. I'm not dwelling on that a lot yet.</div><div><br/></div><div>Ever since Yan posted that comment in which she tagged me and typed a heart, I've started fantasizing about her, too. And she only posted it yesterday. I want to be able to warmly greet her, and Monique, and Steph when I see them again, and perhaps utter some joyous greeting.</div><div><br/></div><div>I'm scared that I again will bvarely even be able to reach out and hug them. Or far more importantly, say their names. It seems so EASY now, just imagining successful talk, but now I'm also able to recall the feeling of being completely out of words as soon as I find myself in the smallest thing that qualifies as a social situation.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>6-12</div><div><br/></div><div>This morning Irene decided to speak to me in Chinese, out of the blue. I replied hesitantly in mostly English. The problem was that she spoke so quietly that I had to repeatedly ask &quot;Huh? Huh?&quot; and sometimes still couuld never understand her. It's kind of amazing how obvious my own flaws in other people have suddenly become to me. I'm going to mention Jeff again; I drove just him and me to lunch today and it was painful listening to my voice become quieter and softer and softer...</div><div><br/></div><div>Maybe I've just been ignoring her, but I now realize just how concerned my mom is about me and my social problems. It's a little more than minor now. I've never thought of it as something that I would have to consciously work on correcting. I thought all of those adults at the Toastmasters meeting last week were weird, and what's truly terrifying is the thought of me never improving and turning out broken beyond repair in the end.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>end of weekend June 16</div><div><br/></div><div>I have to write about:</div><div><br/></div><div><ul><li>the Chinese school picnic</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>Amanda</li></ul></li><li>today's lunch</li><li style="list-style: none; display: inline"><ul><li>Lisa</li><li>the boys didn't come</li></ul></li><li>Zora</li></ul></div><div><br/></div><div>I think I'm nothing more than a wonderer. I'll just sit here and wonder until the sun swallows up the Earth.</div><div><br/></div><div>The most frustrating thing</div><div>        is that I have a picture in my head of how perfect I want everything to be</div><div>        but I have no idea of what that picture really looks like.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>up until June 24</div><div><br/></div><div>Days are definitely becoming shorter now. Last I heard, V is in FLorence, Italy. I wonder what he's doing there. I don't even know if he's with friends, or where he wants to go after school, and it never occurs to me to ask him these things.</div><div><br/></div><div>I went out to lunch today with Jeff and another new hire, who I didn't really care about but I watched him shift gears while driving us in his Maxima. It made me think of Anthony. It was the same model.</div><div><br/></div><div>Jeff is very indecisive. I've been wanting to note that about him. And I want to ensure that I'm not like him.</div><div><br/></div><div>I also don't want to be friends with anyone there. I'm convinced that I won't be able to be my completely self around them. They're too serious, too normal. I don't know what they do with their lives. Joe (old age, new hire) sat with me and Jeff at lunch and started talking to us about how expensive his car insurance is. They both recounted their experiences rear-ending someone, while I remained detached.</div><div><br/></div><div>Despite all of my mother's encouraging and continual urging, I still find very little motivation to try talking to ANY of my Tech friends. Whenever I think about any of them, I'm certain that they have so little to no need for me that I have no chance of finding what I need in them. Maybe this will  be my downfall. I have a guaranteed maximum of one year remaining in a nest, a harbor of safety, until I graduate not just from college, but also possibly, and far more terrifyingly, from everyone I've ever known.</div><div><br/></div><div>Single word: Lonely</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div><div>the 28th of June</div><div><br/></div><div>Today nobody came upstairs to my cubicle to fetch me for lunch. This has a very simple interpretation: if you want to be part of a group, you must chase after it because no one's going to come recruit you. I must say that I still don't particularly care for this particular, however. I'm quite certain that I won't miss any other setting less (more on that to come). I don't want to listen to music, my music, because I don't want any songs associated with this period of time. I won't miss anyone here. I don't plan to ever reply on anyone here.</div><div><br/></div><div>Today Kevin annoyed me further. He's a little-to-no-nonsense type of sounds awkward sometimes when lighthearted. Body language. He too rarely makes eye contact. Looks downward when smiling. Detestable attributes. Many of which I share. He calls me by my full name &quot;Hey Daniel&quot; followed by a long, automatic sigh.</div><div><br/></div><div>I become so frustrated with myself when talking to Jeff while one of us is driving because I have so many of the same conversation skill shortcomings that he has. I end up withholding a significant chunk of my input. I can't act naturally.</div><div><br/></div><div>That's my problem with them. They're all so horridly normal peopl;e with seemingly stone set lives. I can't be who I want to be when I'm with them, I'm convinced of that.</div><div><br/></div><div>They're not enemies, but I don't like them.</div><div><br/></div><div>I'm my own worst enemy.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/></div>
today, the 4th of July, and yesterday
<div><br/></div><div>Jeff my cubicle-mate came out for lunch for the first time, and he and Dmitry had a healthy conversation on PhDs and biomedical stuff. I tried to chime in as much as I could, because I couldn't stop noticing how quiet the fat Jeff was being and how he remained almost completely absent from the discussion. I did not want to be like him at all so I focused effort on talking when I could. I don't think I did a very good job. I also think Jeff (fat) tried to start a second convo w/ me, but I'm not sure. He kept bringing up stupid topics, like how the arcade machine behind our table was stuttering. Disgusted, is my word. He was also always on his phone, showing us apps and stuff relevant to snippets of discussion. Ugh. I wondered just how ACF people made the same mental notes about me, whenever I exhibited the same behavior when hanging out with them. Earlier, Dmitry mentioned that his wife is Indian and then Jeff (cubicle) said his girlfriend is Indian (so that's who is in his framed photo). Needless to say, I thought about <u>Anjaly</u>.</div><div><br/></div><div>In other news, Melissa took 3 days to answer my Facebook message, and David &amp; Yan both paid at least brief attention to a status I posted, reading: &quot;broken, funny, lovely&quot;</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
7-8 m</div><div><br/></div><div>Didn't write anything over the weekend. What remains of the big picture:</div><div><br/></div><div>When I saw the Milky Way in the sky, all I wanted was to tell Anjaly about it. Because she had mentioned seeing it somewhere once.</div><div><br/></div><div>The small place at which we stayed the first night made me think of the setting of &quot;Walk Two Moons&quot; even though it was a geographical location. I thought about how great it must be to spend every day living.</div><div><br/></div><div>Traveling with the family has always been stressful. Parents always quarrel. Car cramped, even though SUV. Driving has enjoyable.</div><div><br/></div><div>I told Tom about stopping by at Cornell. He wanted me to visit Amy. Even gave me her phone number and address. I would have been more excited about that in the past. Didn't get to meet up with him on Sunday because it was late afternoon and he didn't answer a text.</div><div><br/></div><div>News from Zora: apparently, she's &quot;dating&quot; fellow player 'Rogue Angel Seven' who's 33 years old. What in the world is up with his life?</div><div><br/></div><div>That makes me safe from her now, at least. I still want to talk to her. Yesterday she told me that a girl could like me and I not know. And to keep an open mind. Today she said that there's no point in being sorry for something that happened in the past.</div><div><br/></div><div>And it was back to work today. I really wanted to stare at Caroline's breasts. Can't wait to get out of there.</div><div><br/></div><div>Still haven't gone to New York, still haven't learned to cook.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
7-9 t</div><div><br/></div><div>brief</div><div><br/></div><div>I knew this would happen since the night before I left for London. I still need Zora. Her issues scare me a bit, but I'm not going to mention her to V anymore.</div><div><br/></div><div>You know what, just fuck all of them, the ones at work.</div><div><br/></div><div>I keep fantasizing about sex with Jessie. It's sad because if I ever do &quot;catch up&quot; with her when school starts, I'll be thinking of these thoughts that will never happen.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
the 10th of July</div><div><br/></div><div>Less enthusiastic about work than ever. I have said earlier that the days were passing by more quickly. But the weeks themselves feel slow. I saw Marleah sitting down in her stand-up cubicle and instanly better about needing to sit myself. That week after they had their Friday sushi, when she told me &quot;we'll find something for you&quot; after I said i don't like sushi. I should have smiled to myself.</div><div><br/></div><div>Also, I'm doing it again: trying to get people's unwarranted attention by remaining absent. Such illogical actions whose consequence i continue to ignore. Please don't let me be like this in the fall. <u><b>It's NOT going to work.</b></u></div><div><u><b><br/></b></u></div><div><u><b><br/></b></u></div><div><hr/>
Complements</div><div><br/></div><div>early June: Marleah likes my blue plaid shirt (unprovoked)</div><div>early July: Yan likes my &quot;Bionicle representation of \[my\]self&quot; (response)</div><div>July 9/10: Zora tells me I'm a nice guy and that i can communicate (missed the boat, but gives me hope)</div><div>July 11: Maria likes my cufflinks</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><hr/>
the 16th of July</div><div><br/></div><div>V is coming back in just a week. I should think of questions to ask him.</div><div><br/></div><div>When school starts I want to become friends with Yan. I know it's stupid of me to keep thinking of her. And it's sad that this time, instead of envisioning a good year, I'm anticipating another lonely one. But not as low as last year though, god no.</div><div><br/></div><div>Series of small but consistent events have led me to the conclusion that should have been evident all along: I'm the one who isn't changing, who isn't adapting to the environment. The setting's been changing all along. Each new chapter actually DID have new characters in them. They just felt lonely to me because I haven't been able to take any characters from one to another.</div><div><br/></div><div>Also: <u>what bothers you in others is what bothers you about yourself</u></div><div><u><br/></u></div><div><u><br/></u></div><div><hr/>
the 4th of august</div><div><br/></div><div>I have a mere week remaining here at home. And I am incredibly nervous about how my last year of school is going to go. There's a very fragile yet enormous stress that comes with anticipating a final year falling, as my previous three have, well below expectations. Every time my mind dares to tread this swamp, I feel myself shaking on the inside. Again, I pore over how this summer no one talked to me. Perhaps Barcelona's done me one ill favor too many. Steph, Enoch, and maybe David and Sam all tried, and more than once too, to keep in touch with me then, but this time I saw next to no such effort at all. And I made no such effort myself. By now I'm convinced that they would yield pathetic consequences, and that I don't deserve their attention anyway. I don't want to set myself up for failure yet again, so I'm going to lower to bar. In turn, that will lower my motivation. So I'll wallow on, my boat against the current, hoping that I'll at least have enough of a spark in me to hug some people.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>      ]]>
